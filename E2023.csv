afghanistan,"The Taliban use force to suppress demonstrations and media coverage of those demonstrations. However, the authorities reportedly orchestrate rallies to showcase views they promote, such as demands for the lifting of sanctions.Afghan women continued to stage sporadic protests during 2022 but risked severe mistreatment for doing so. In October, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported incidents where female protesters were tortured by authorities, along with male relatives; female protesters told HRW that relatives, including children, were detained with them. Authorities used water cannons to disperse those protesting the higher-education ban in December.",1,"NGOs are permitted to operate as long as they are registered with the Ministry of Economy. However, they are subject to multiple and intrusive checks, including to ensure that they observe regulations on women’s dress. In December 2022, the ministry told NGOs not to allow female employees to report for work and threatened to revoke the registration of NGOs for noncompliance. Several aid groups, including the Norwegian Refugee Council and Save the Children, suspended their operations as a result.Authorities applied informal pressure to install their supporters on the boards of NGOs and pressured donors to interact with Taliban-controlled NGOs. NGOs involved in humanitarian operations faced pressure from the Taliban to prioritize their members and supporters when distributing aid. Personnel enjoyed no protection from harassment, and staff members belonging to the few human rights–focused organizations active in Afghanistan were particularly vulnerable. Human rights activists have been arrested, tortured, and killed since the Taliban returned to power, while many involved in human rights work have fled.",1,"Under the 2004 constitution, Afghan workers had broad constitutional protections. However, labor rights were poorly defined, and no effective enforcement or dispute-resolution mechanisms existed. Unions were largely absent from the large informal and agricultural sectors. The rise of the Taliban has not yet had a noticeable effect on labor rights.",1
albania,"Freedom of assembly is generally respected.Several protests and events were held in 2022, including some political rallies that turned violent. In January, supporters of Sali Berisha attempted to storm PD headquarters; they were forcibly dispersed by police using tear gas and water cannons, leading to several injuries. In December, Berisha was physically attacked while leading an antigovernment protest; the assailant was quickly arrested.",3,Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) generally function without restriction but have limited funding due to dependence on foreign donors.,3,"Workers are constitutionally allowed to organize and bargain collectively, and most have the right to strike. However, effective collective bargaining remains limited, and union members have little protection against discrimination by employers.",2
algeria,"Legal restrictions on freedom of assembly remain in place but are inconsistently enforced. Though the Hirak protests that began in 2019 were sometimes tolerated, the authorities frequently used force and arbitrary arrests to preempt or disrupt rallies.Hirak protesters faced increasing repression after demonstrations resumed in 2021, causing the movement to lose momentum; large-scale Hirak protests did not return in 2022. However, police continued to arrest individuals alleged to have ties to the movement during the year.Other antigovernment demonstrations continued in 2022 and were met with repression by the authorities. In April, security forces dispersed a demonstration commemorating past pro-Amazigh protest movements, arresting several participants.",1,"The 2012 law on associations effectively restricts the formation, funding, and activities of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Permits and receipts of application submission are required to establish and operate NGOs, but organizations often face considerable delays and bureaucratic obstacles when attempting to obtain such documents, leaving them in a legally precarious position.The authorities have targeted human rights activists who are close to the Hirak and the political opposition. In February 2022, activist Faleh Hammoudi was sentenced to three years in prison and a 100,000 dinar ($700) fine on charges including running an “unregistered association,” due to his work heading a chapter of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH).NGOs must notify the government of staffing changes and submit detailed reports on their funding; those that accept foreign funding without government approval risk fines or imprisonment of staff.",1,"The country’s main labor federation, the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), has been criticized for its close relationship to the government and for its failure to advocate for workers’ interests.Workers require government approval to establish new unions. This is difficult to obtain in practice, leaving many unions without legal status. Authorities routinely clamp down on independent unions. The Autonomous National Union of Electricity and Gas Workers (SNATEG), an independent union that represents public utility workers, has been repeatedly harassed by the authorities in recent years.",1
andorra,"Andorran law provides for freedom of assembly, and the government respects this right in practice. Demonstrations against government policies and in response to other social and political controversies take place on occasion. Authorities imposed temporary restrictions on large gatherings during 2020 to limit the spread of COVID-19.",4,Various nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) function without restriction. Human rights groups are generally able to publish their findings and advocate for improvements without repercussions.,4,"The right to unionize is protected by law and the constitution, and a new labor law that took effect in 2019 established regulations for collective bargaining and the right to strike. However, unions and the political opposition characterized the law as a setback, arguing in part that it placed unnecessary constraints on the right to strike and increased job insecurity. There are no laws in place to penalize antiunion discrimination.In 2018, Andorra experienced its first major strike in 85 years when civil servants walked out to protest reforms to their contracts proposed by the government.",3
angola,"Constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly are poorly upheld. While the Lourenço administration initially showed more tolerance for public demonstrations than its predecessor, peaceful marches are still frequently met with arrests and violence by the security forces, at times resulting in the deaths of protesters.Authorities broke up or prevented planned protests on multiple occasions in 2022, both before and after the August elections. In April, for example, police in the capital disrupted a protest calling for free and fair elections and the release of political prisoners, arresting 22 people for disobeying police orders. Two organizers were convicted and made to pay fines, but the rest were acquitted.In September, police prevented a demonstration against election fraud on the outskirts of Luanda and arrested three people after they were interviewed by reporters at the scene. Several others were detained or chased away by officers as they passed by. There were also reports that civic activists had been arrested at their homes. The army and police generally maintained a heavy and visible security presence on the streets in the wake of the August elections, contributing to a climate of fear that may have further deterred assembly.",1,"Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that work on human rights and governance issues are closely monitored. The MPLA has historically made vocal attempts to discredit their work and sometimes threatened such groups with lawsuits and outright closure, prompting many to curtail their activities.Ahead of the August 2022 elections, authorities worked to prevent planned civil society meetings from taking place. In May, for example, police physically blocked two NGOs from hosting a conference on peacebuilding. In September, authorities announced the arrest of 12 civic activists for “financing and promoting the dissemination” of videos on social media to “sow insecurity, hatred, and panic among the population.” They were released without charge after several days of detention.Two prominent activists who were arrested in January remained in detention at year’s end. Luther Campos was arrested for promoting a socioeconomic protest by taxi drivers and was still awaiting trial as of December. Gilson da Silva Moreira was then arrested after attempting to publicize the harsh conditions of Campos’s confinement; he received a suspended prison sentence of one year and three months in October, but he continued to be held pending an appeal. ",1,"Certain employees who provide services considered essential—including prison guards and firefighters, but also workers in the oil sector—may not legally strike. Unions not associated with the MPLA have faced interference and harassment.In May 2022, police intervened in a strike over pay and working conditions at the construction site for a hydroelectric dam in Kwanza Norte Province, killing at least three workers. According to the NGO Friends of Angola, several other workers were injured, and some were illegally detained inside the facilities of the construction firm, China Gezhouba Group Corporation. The authorities accused the strikers of vandalizing equipment and threatening Chinese citizens. State media reported in June that the government had brokered a new contract between the two sides, though it was unclear whether the agreement was freely negotiated or properly implemented. ",1

Organized labor is dominated by Peronists, and most labor unions have been controlled by the same individuals or groups for decades. Internal opposition to union leadership has been limited by fraud and intimidation.",3
armenia,"The right to assemble is legally guaranteed but inconsistently upheld in practice.Frequent antigovernment protests took place throughout the country in 2022. In June, police used stun grenades to disperse protesters in Yerevan who were demanding Prime Minister Pashinyan’s resignation after a law proposed by opposition that would reject any peace accord with Azerbaijan failed to pass in Parliament. At least 42 people, including police officers, were injured in the clashes between police and protesters.In September 2022, relatives of soldiers who had been killed in the war with Azerbaijan peacefully protested during government-organized Independence Day events. Police violently detained at least 37 people, and some protesters were injured. In response, 35 local NGOs called for the resignation of the Yerevan chief of police.",3,"Outspoken NGOs operate in Armenia, most of which are based in Yerevan. These NGOs lack significant local funding and often rely on foreign donors. Despite this impediment, civil society was active in the 2018 protests, and has consulted with the government on policy matters, most notably on electoral, constitutional, and anticorruption reform.",3,"The law protects the rights of workers to form and join independent unions, strike, and engage in collective bargaining. However, these protections are not well enforced, and employers are generally able to block union activity in practice.",2
australia,"Freedom of assembly is not explicitly codified in law, but the government generally respects the right to peaceful assembly. There are some limited restrictions meant to ensure public safety, and some incidents of police using excessive force against protesters have been reported. Although public health measures imposed to stop the spread of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 constrained the right to assembly, these measures were progressively wound back in 2022. A series of violent protests against vaccination mandates and lockdown restrictions occurred in the country’s two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, in the second half of 2021.",4,"NGOs are generally free to form, function, and receive funding. Advocacy groups and charities are exempt from restrictions on donations by certain foreign entities, which were introduced in 2018.",4,"Workers can freely organize and bargain collectively, and trade unions actively engage in political debates and campaigns. However, strikes are only allowed when negotiating new union agreements, and may only pertain to issues under negotiation, although strikes and other forms of industrial action are not uncommon in Australia. Throughout 2022, the metropolitan train network of Sydney, Australia’s largest city, was frequently disrupted due to ongoing disputes between the rail union and the New South Wales state government.While there are no formal restrictions on workers’ rights to organize, in practice, policies from successive governments have contributed to plummetting union membership. By the end of 2022, only 12.5 percent of Australian workers were union members, compared to 41 percent in 1992.",4
austria,"Freedom of assembly is constitutionally protected and respected in practice. However, beginning in March 2020, assemblies were periodically subject to strict regulation under COVID-19-related public health measures. In March 2022, the government lifted most remaining restrictions, including limits on event sizes. Despite COVID-19-related restrictions on public gatherings, large protests against lockdown measures were held throughout 2020 and 2021.

azerbaijan,"The law imposes tight restrictions on freedom of assembly, which is contingent on the protection of “public order and morals.” Activists have complained that in practice, the obstacles to public gatherings include additional, extralegal measures. Unsanctioned assemblies can draw a harsh police response and fines for participants, and the government largely stopped issuing permits for rallies in Baku in 2019. Even when permits are issued, the government typically confines demonstrations to relatively isolated locations, where it can track attendees through facial-recognition technology and mobile-phone data.In May 2022, about 30 people were detained prior to a planned antigovernment protest, organized by activists in response to several incidents in which the rights of opposition politicians, journalists, and members of civil society had been violated.  Unlike in previous years, the police did not prevent a rally held by women’s rights activists on International Women’s Day in March. However, several participants reported that police mistreated LGBT+ activists and confiscated pro-LGBT+ flags and placards on the day of the march.",0,"Repressive laws on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have been used to pressure both local and foreign organizations, many of which have suspended operations when their bank accounts were frozen or their offices raided. Nearly all organizations or networks that work on human rights are forced by the state to operate in a legal gray zone. The government has refused to permit the European Union to provide grant support for local civil society groups. Civic activists are routinely subjected to harassment, intimidation, detention, and abuse by police.Activists also risk surveillance; a 2021 OCCRP report noted that over 40 Azerbaijani activists were likely targeted with Pegasus, along with family members.Several activists were arrested on spurious charges during 2022. Human rights defender Bakhtiyar Hajiyev was arrested on hooliganism charges in December; his lawyer called the charges “manufactured,” saying they were connected to his activism. More than 30 people were detained during a rally held in support of Hajiyev the same month, including prominent opposition activist Tofig Yagublu. Yagublu was convicted of “petty hooliganism” and “disobeying the police” the same day he was arrested. Both Hajiyev and Yagublu remained in detention at year’s end.",0,"Although the law permits the formation of trade unions and the right to strike, the majority of unions remain closely affiliated with the government, and many categories of workers are prohibited from striking.

Domestic, agricultural, and temporary workers do not have the right to join or form unions.",1
bangladesh,"The constitution provides for the rights of assembly and association, but this is upheld inconsistently. Protesters are frequently injured and occasionally killed during clashes in which police use excessive force. While space for protests expanded in 2022, AL supporters and authorities targeted opposition rallies. In September, the European Union delegation to Bangladesh voiced concerns over clashes between BNP supporters and police that began in late August, some of which were fatal. In December, at least 1 person died and 60 were injured after police fired on BNP demonstrators at a Dhaka rally. Authorities then took two BNP leaders into custody for questioning, accusing them of provoking the violence.",2,"Many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operate without onerous restrictions, but the use of foreign funds is closely monitored, and the government has broad authority to deregister NGOs. Democracy, governance, and human rights NGOs are regularly denied permission for proposed projects and face harassment and surveillance. Pressure and intimidation from Islamist groups also limit NGO activities on some issues such as LGBT+ rights and protection for religious minorities.In April 2022, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that Bangladeshi authorities were retaliating against human rights advocates, their relatives, and the survivors of victims mistreated or killed by the RAB, which the US government sanctioned in 2021. In June 2022, the government revoked the registration of human rights NGO Odhikar, which documented human rights abuses in Bangladesh; the decision was upheld in September.",2,"Legal reforms in 2015 eased restrictions on the formation of unions. However, union leaders who attempt to organize or unionize workers continue to face dismissal or physical intimidation. Labor rights organizations also face harassment.

belarus,"The government severely restricts freedom of assembly. Protests require permission from local authorities, who often arbitrarily deny it. The 2021 amendment to the law on mass events imposes strict authorization requirements and impedes organizers’ ability to raise funds for protests.During the 2020 electoral period, hundreds of thousands of people participated in unprecedented prodemocracy protests. Major campaign rallies for Tsikhanouskaya were held across the country. Police and military forces only partially succeeded in blocking people from congregating before voting day on August 9. In the following weeks, the regime deployed military equipment and armed riot police who indiscriminately attacked and arrested people, killing many. Numerous instances of cruel treatment, beatings, and torture of protesters were recorded, with total impunity for the security forces involved.Under the criminal code, those who participate in an unauthorized mass event can face administrative fines or 15- to 30-day detention periods. The regime instrumentalized administrative detention against participants in the prodemocracy movement that began in 2020.Antiwar protests were held in at least 12 Belarusian cities following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. More than 800 people were arrested during the protests; most of those arrested were held for 15 days, with many being physically abused by security forces while detained.",0,"Freedom of association is severely restricted. In January 2022, criminal-code amendments recriminalized participation in unregistered or dissolved organizations; those accused of participating in such organizations face steep fines and up to two years in prison.Prior to the 2020 prodemocracy movement, few human rights groups managed to operate due to resource shortages and pressure from the authorities, and staff and supporters risked prosecution and fines for their activism.NGOs and public associations, including prominent organizations like the Belarusian Association of Journalists, the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, and the Belarusian PEN Center, have been ordered to dissolve in recent years. According to Lawtrend, 757 NGOs were in forced-dissolution processes or were removed from an official register between 2021 and the end of 2022, while 416 had decided to self-liquidate. The government actively uses antiextremism legislation against independent organizations and individuals to restrict public outreach and suppress dissent. Human rights activists who remained in the country following the 2020 prodemocracy protests have faced harassment and threats from security forces. During 2022, human rights activist Nasta Loika was repeatedly detained on a variety of spurious charges, including “extremism”; in December, Loika was further charged with two criminal offenses, including “violating public order.” Loika remained in pretrial detention at year’s end.",0,"Independent labor unions face harassment, and their leaders are frequently fired and prosecuted for engaging in peaceful protests. No independent unions have been registered since 1999, when Lukashenka issued a decree setting extremely restrictive registration requirements.Independent unions were prominent in the prodemocracy movement in 2020, striking to protest the fraudulent presidential election and police violence toward peaceful demonstrators. The state increasingly targeted and pressured workers to prevent them from going on strike. Union leaders and rank-and-file members were arrested, fined, dismissed from their posts, sent to psychiatric institutions, and forced into exile. In 2021, security forces arrested at least 11 people, accusing them of involvement in an independent labor movement.

Large numbers of political figures and activists were arrested leading up to and after the 2021 presidential election; several of those arrested at that time were released in 2022. New regulations included in a 2021 draft law would require civil society organizations to renew their registration and pay a significant fee, which may limit small NGOs’ ability to operate and enable the authorities to withdraw the registration of organizations that criticize the government.

bolivia,"Bolivian law protects the right to peaceful assembly. However, many past protests have been marred by clashes between demonstrators and police, as well as physical confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters.Widespread protests during the 2019 elections were characterized by high levels of violence among protesters, counterprotesters, and security forces. A report issued in August 2021 by the Interdisciplinary Group of Experts (GIEI), commissioned through an agreement between the IACHR and the Bolivian government, found that during the protests that led to Morales’s resignation, his administration facilitated the transport of its supporters and provided them with materials and weapons to use against the opposition, causing grave human rights violations. The IACHR and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) further investigated police use of excessive force during the 2019 postelectoral unrest, reporting that the police forces had committed serious human rights violations.Large protests against the Arce government’s decision to delay the national census until 2024 were held in October and November 2022 in the Santa Cruz region, led by opposition leader Luis Camacho. The protests featured occasional violent clashes between police and protesters, but were called off when opposition groups and the Arce administration reached a consensus on a new census date. Violent protests in Santa Cruz resumed in December, following Camacho’s arrest on charges of terrorism for his role in the 2019 protests against Morales.Other protests during the year included demonstrations by coca growers from Yungas, who accused the government of attempting to weaken their organization in favor of coca growers from the Chapare region, who are allied with the ruling party. These protests were met with high levels of repression by security forces, and according to the OHCHR, demonstrators were subjected to violence and “excessive use of force” by the police.",3,"Many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operate but are subject to some legal restrictions.

eswatini,"Freedom of assembly is restricted. Surveillance of protests is common, and the information collected is reportedly used to deny protesters access to government jobs and services. Demonstrations are often violently dispersed by police, and protesters risk arrest and detention. Nevertheless, labor and prodemocracy protests have taken place in spite of these risks. Demonstrations that are not perceived as a direct challenge to the king have been allowed to go forward. Widespread prodemocracy protests continued into 2022 despite an official ban on protests issued in October 2021. The protests began in May 2021 and escalated that June after Mswati banned citizens from petitioning the government. Security forces attempted to suppress the demonstrations, subjecting peaceful protesters to arbitrary arrests and using indiscriminate force to disperse gatherings, resulting in the deaths of more than 80 people; hundreds more were hospitalized for their injuries. This crackdown on dissent continued in 2022. During the year, security forces attempted to forcibly disperse protesters by shooting tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition into crowds. Protesters also faced arbitrary arrest and physical assaults by security forces. Student activist Colani Maseko, whose January arrest had prompted a wave of demonstrations, was arrested again in May while participating in a protest; he was allegedly tortured following his arrest. Maseko was later hospitalized from injuries sustained while he was detained.",0,"The operation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) has been inhibited by broadly written sedition and terrorism laws as well as police monitoring and interference. Organizations that advocate for democracy remain banned. Despite such restrictions, it appears there is limited tolerance of some forms of human rights–based legal activism. For example, Women and Law Southern Africa–Swaziland was allowed to bring a case on gender equality in divorce settlements, with the court deciding in its favor in 2019. In 2020, an LGBT+ advocacy organization that had been denied official registration challenged the rejection in court. The High Court ultimately upheld the rejection when it ruled against the organization, Eswatini Sexual and Gender Minorities (ESGM), in April 2022, stating that although the constitution guarantees fundamental rights “irrespective of gender or sex,” those rights are subject to Eswatini’s laws, which do not permit same-sex relations. One judge dissented, saying that the rejection was executed in a “grossly irregular manner.”",1,"Eswatini has active, vocal labor unions, but workers’ rights are poorly upheld in practice.

Moreover, while nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are more able to legally operate in the human rights and governance spheres, practically many of these organizations are unable to access large parts of Ethiopia either due to security challenges or a lack of official approval, as was the case in Tigray. While the discourse around NGOs is more open, many of the practical realities for these groups have not improved. Local civil society organizations (CSOs) face threats and warnings for advocating for issues contrary to the government’s position, especially in relation to internal conflicts. In September 2022, government security agents prevented a group of 35 CSOs from hosting a press event with media representatives, in which they were to call for warring parties in Ethiopia to end the violence and come to the negotiate a peace deal. The organizations instead independently issued a statement calling for the cessation of violence in Tigray. Days later, the government threatened to revoke the licenses of the organizations involved, claiming they had acted against the “sovereignty of the country and the public interest.”",1,"The Ethiopian Constitution recognizes the right of workers to join trade unions, and more than 500,000 workers are organized under the umbrella of the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions (CETU).

In 2021, CHRD vice president Narges Mohammadi was sentenced in absentia to two-and-a-half years’ imprisonment and 80 lashes. She was taken into custody by intelligence agents that November, after which she was sent to Tehran’s Evin prison to serve her sentence. She received multiple additional prison sentences in 2022.Groups that focus on apolitical issues also face crackdowns. In May 2022, an appeals court upheld a 2021 ruling to dissolve the Imam Ali Popular Students Relief Society, a prominent NGO that supported the poor and survivors of natural disasters. In the 2021 decision, the court sustained an Interior Ministry assertion that the NGO had deviated from its mission and “questioned Islamic rulings.”",0,"Iran does not permit the creation of labor unions; only state-sponsored labor councils are allowed. Labor rights groups have come under pressure in recent years, with key leaders and activists sentenced to prison on national security charges. Workers who engage in strikes are vulnerable to dismissal and arrest. Despite such reprisals, labor protests have increased in recent years due to growing economic hardship. In June 2022, the Iranian Teachers’ Union’s Coordination Council reported that more than 100 teachers had been arrested the previous day for participating in a nationwide protest calling for improved working conditions and the release of previously imprisoned teachers.",1
iraq,"The constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, but protesters are frequently at risk of violence or arrest. These dangers have become acute during the ongoing Tishreen protest movement against corruption, poor infrastructure and government services, and high unemployment. Security forces have used curfews, tear gas, and live ammunition to suppress demonstrations in Baghdad and other southern cities. Hundreds of people had been killed in retaliation for their protest activities during 2022; of them, dozens were killed in targeted assassinations outside of protest squares. Iraqi security forces routinely beat, shot, arrested, and tortured protesters. Militiamen kidnap activists, torture them for several days, and then release them to coerce them to cease their antiregime activity. Iranian media and media outlets linked to Iran-backed militias spread false reports about activists to justify their targeting and issued explicit threats to activists and critics set to be targeted next.Following 2020, the number of protests in the Kurdistan region dropped significantly, which local activists claim was the result of security forces’ use of unprecedented levels of violence against protesters. In 2022, Kurdish authorities linked both to the KDP and the PUK continued to prevent protesters from gathering and attacked and arrested peaceful protesters and journalists covering the protests, regardless of the demonstration’s message.",0,"Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) enjoy societal support and a relatively hospitable regulatory environment, though they must register with the government and obtain approval from the commission responsible for suppressing Baathism. For international NGOs, registration is cumbersome and often requires payment of bribes. In Kurdistan, registration of NGOs is straightforward, but NGOs must renew their registration annually.Militias have threatened, assaulted, kidnapped, tortured, raped in captivity, assassinated, and planted explosive devices at the homes of multiple critics and activists (and their family members), particularly those involved in the Tishreen protest movement. Ali Akram al-Bayati, a prominent human rights defender and former member of Iraq’s national human rights body the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR), was abducted in February 2022 for supposedly defaming the Anti-Corruption Committee during an interview in late 2020. The targeting of a former IHCHR member, who enjoyed immunity for the duration of his term, may intimidate current and future members from investigating human rights abuses.",2,"Labor laws allow for collective bargaining (even by nonunionized workers), protect the rights of subcontractors and migrant workers, and permit workers to strike, among other rights.

israel,"Protests and demonstrations are widely permitted and typically peaceful. However, some protest activities—such as desecration of the flag of Israel—can draw criminal penalties, and police have sometimes attempted to restrict peaceful demonstrations. In May 2021, the possible eviction of Palestinian families in East Jerusalem sparked widespread protests, excessive police violence, and intercommunal clashes involving Arab and Jewish civilians in mixed towns within Israel. The unrest included destruction of property and vigilante attacks against unarmed residents. More than 2,000 people were arrested; while some Jews were among those detained, the vast majority were Arabs, suggesting likely police discrimination. Antigovernment protests largely subsided after Netanyahu lost his premiership in June 2021, though some demonstrations did take place in front of the prime minister’s residence while Naftali Bennett was in office. In December 2022, thousands of protesters rallied against Netanyahu’s return as prime minister; unlike in 2021, police generally did not respond with force. ",3,"The environment for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) has deteriorated in recent years. A law enacted in 2012 requires NGOs to submit financial reports four times a year on support received from foreign government sources. Under a 2016 law, NGOs that receive more than half of their funding from foreign governments must disclose this fact publicly and in any written or oral communications with elected officials. The measure mainly affects groups associated with the political left that oppose Israel’s policies toward Palestinians; foreign funding for right-leaning groups that support Jewish settlements in the West Bank, for example, more often comes from private sources.A 2017 law bars access to the country for any foreign individuals or groups that publicly support a boycott of Israel or its West Bank settlements. The measure was criticized by civil society organizations as an obstacle to the activities of many pro-Palestinian and human rights groups.",2,"Workers may join unions and have the right to strike and bargain collectively, although employers often attempt to prevent such moves.

The Ministry of the Interior has canceled planned public events without advance notice or explanation. Violations of the law on assembly can draw fines and jail time. Security forces are known to engage in violent confrontations with protesters.In March and April 2022, hundreds of journalists, politicians, and activists involved in the country’s Hirak were arrested under vague stipulations in the penal code and the Cybercrime Prevention Law. Authorities carried out the arrests to prevent widespread antigovernment demonstrations and sit-ins planned to protest government corruption and the dissolution of the Teachers’ Syndicate, as well as to commemorate the 2011 protest movement. Widespread protests against rising fuel prices and the cost-of-living crisis also occurred in December. Rioters and other violent actors were present during the demonstrations, and their actions resulted in the death of a police officer.",0,"While many local and international NGOs can operate in the country, there are significant restrictions on civil society. The Ministry of Social Development has broad supervisory powers over NGO operations, has the authority to deny registration and requests for foreign funding, and can disband organizations it finds objectionable. Board members of NGOs must be vetted by state security officials. In practice, these regulations are applied in an opaque and arbitrary manner.",1,"Workers have the right to form unions, but only in 17 designated industries; no new union has formed since 1976. Groups must obtain government approval and join the country’s semiofficial union federation, the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions (GFJTU). The right to strike is limited by requirements for advance notice and mediation, and participants in an illegal strike are subject to dismissal.In 2013, a dozen unofficial trade unions formed the Jordanian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (JFITU). Lacking official status, they are not allowed to establish headquarters, collect fees from their members, or engage in collective bargaining. They also face heavy pressure from the GFJTU and government bodies to cease their activities and shut down.The Teachers’ Syndicate began the longest public-sector strike in Jordanian history in 2019, which ended after a deal was struck a month later. However, in July 2020, the union claimed the government reneged on the deal, after which the government ordered a two-year closure of the syndicate, arresting its governing board. Over 250 people were subsequently detained during protests. In June 2022, the courts approved an appeal to cease the prosecution of the Teacher’s Syndicate leadership council and convert their one-year prison sentences to three months, but it upheld a later decision to dissolve the association.In December, truckers and transportation workers in the south of the country went on strike to pressure the government into ending price hikes on fuel and the cost-of-living crisis. Authorities deployed security forces with heavy weaponry and arrested dozens of people. The strike actions continued through year-end.",0
kazakhstan,"Despite constitutional guarantees, the government imposes tight restrictions on freedom of assembly. President Toqaev revised the public assembly law in 2020, forcing groups to give notification three to seven days in advance of a protest and then wait for approval by the local administration. Critics say that the state continues to restrict who can protest and where, as only officially registered groups are allowed to give notification, and gatherings are only allowed in state-approved sites, which are often located far from the center of cities.Organizers and protest participants who do not follow the new law continue to be subject to fines and jail terms. For example, on the day of the presidential election in November 2022, members of the youth opposition movement Oyan Kazakhstan were temporarily detained by police.In January 2022, unsanctioned protests broke out in western regions of the country in response to rising gas prices. The protests grew nationally until violence broke out in Almaty, in response to which a state of emergency was declared. Kazakh troops, supported by the Russian-backed forces from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), quelled the violence after President Toqaev approved a shoot-to-kill order. Thousands of people were detained, and many peaceful protestors were arbitrarily arrested, tortured, and denied legal representation. Hundreds of people were killed. Relatives of protestors were also detained for publicly gathering and requesting that charges be dropped against their family members, some posthumously as their relatives had died in custody.",1,"NGOs continue to operate but face government harassment when they attempt to address politically sensitive issues.

Employers are known to employ severe intimidation efforts to prevent private-sector workers from organizing, and few private sector unions exist in Kosovo. For most of 2022, relations between public-sector unions and the government were tense over worker demands for salary increases. The teachers’ union launched a general strike at the end of August, which postponed the commencement of the academic year for one month.

Proponents of the legislation claim it protects against foreign interference, including the imposition of “Western ideology” and “LGBT+ propaganda.” Human rights groups fear the law will be used to prevent independent NGOs from operating freely. A new draft bill on the registration of NGOs in development in late 2022 could subject currently approved organizations to re-registration and allow the state to shutter an organization and prosecute its members if the group’s activities are deemed to contradict the “health and morals of the population.”Following public outcry over a proposed deal to demarcate Kyrgyzstan’s border with Uzbekistan, the Japarov government launched a broad crackdown on civil society in October.

The decision was justified on claims the campaign incited hatred against India and posed a national security threat. In November 2022, President Solih ratified the Associations Act, which includes financial disclosure requirements as well as provisions for a certain amount of state funding to be directed to NGOs.

Civil society members freely criticize state policies, but López Obrador’s penchant for dismissing criticism and insulting perceived opponents has generated tension between the president and civil society organizations during his presidency. In March 2022, MORENA legislators introduced a bill that, if adopted, would prohibit nonprofit groups from attempting to “influence or change laws either through lobbying or through strategic litigation” if they receive foreign funding.

The 2018 penal code prescribes prison terms and fines for individuals who initiate or participate in a gathering of more than 10 people that threatens security or public order, or who fail to comply with an official order to disperse. While demonstrations are rare in practice, protests against unemployment and the imposition of a value-added tax were held in several cities in May 2021. Overall, security forces mounted a relatively mild response, with some arrests, brief detentions, and use of tear gas reported; by comparison, the authorities had forcibly dispersed demonstrations that broke out in 2011 and used lethal violence in at least one incident during that period.",1,"Oman’s basic law allows for the formation of nongovernmental organizations, but civic life remains limited in practice.

In August 2022, for example, the Internal Security Service arrested and temporarily detained well-known environmental activist Ahmed Issa Qatan after he used social media posts to call for greater political accountability.

panama,"Freedom of assembly is generally respected, and peaceful demonstrations are common, though protests that block roads and highways often result in arrests and altercations with police. In 2022, Panama experienced its most significant protests in recent years. Increases in food, medicine, and fuel prices prompted discontent and gave rise to other political and social demands. In July, Panamanian teachers declared an indefinite strike and were joined by unions, social organizations, Indigenous groups, and other sectors of the population. The protests included street demonstrations and blockades on major highways, which caused shortages in Panama City, the country’s capital. As a result, the Catholic Church facilitated a dialogue between the government and the leaders of two civil society organizations associated with the strikes, the National Alliance for the Rights of the Organized People (ANADEPO) and the People United for Life Alliance. The dialogue was criticized for failing to include all sectors of the country, and more than 115 associations and guilds from the private sector asked to be represented in deliberations. A second phase of dialogue has been established, expanding the sectors and topics addressed.

Some of these protests turned violent, and a 30-day state of emergency was imposed in Lima.In December, following the impeachment of then president Castillo, tens of thousands of protesters across the country held demonstrations in support of the ousted president, many of which turned violent. The newly installed Boluarte government deployed the military and implemented a state of emergency in response to the protests, limiting assembly rights and granting “special powers” to security forces. Violent tactics were deployed both by protesters, who burned buildings and blockaded transportation links across the country, and by security forces, who used excessive force and arbitrarily detained participants while attempting to disperse the crowds. At year’s end, hundreds of protesters and security officials had been injured, and more than two dozen protesters had been killed.

russia,"The government restricts freedom of assembly. Overwhelming police responses, the excessive use of force, routine arrests, and harsh fines and prison sentences have largely discouraged unsanctioned protests, while pro-Kremlin groups are able to demonstrate freely. It is extremely difficult for the Kremlin’s opponents to obtain permission to hold a protest or rally. At the regional level, extensive location-based restrictions prohibit assemblies in as much as 70 percent of public space. Authorities can ban rallies on vaguely defined “public interest” grounds. Those who are labeled foreign agents are prohibited from organizing public events under legislation that took effect in December 2022. In addition, authorities employ an expansive surveillance apparatus to monitor activists and use facial-recognition technology to identify and arrest demonstrators.The government cracked down on public assemblies in 2022 as it waged war against Ukraine. Criminal-code revisions passed in March criminalized antiwar demonstrations. Security personnel used excessive force to disperse rallies, which were held nationwide as the war began. OVD-Info, a Russian human rights NGO, reported that 13,500 people were arrested, including at least 100 minors, by early March. Security personnel physically attacked demonstrators and bystanders while dispersing rallies; detainees were regularly mistreated, threatened with physical violence, and tortured after being taken into custody.

tunisia,"Like the 2014 constitution, the 2022 constitution guarantees the rights to assembly and peaceful demonstration. During the postrevolutionary period, public protests on political, social, and economic issues were frequent and well-attended. However, a 2015 counterterrorism law and successive states of emergency imposed significant constraints on such gatherings.Emergency measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic have also been abused to crack down on protests. For example, new public health restrictions on public gatherings were announced in January 2022, ahead of planned demonstrations coinciding with the anniversary of the 2011 revolution. Police routinely use violent tactics to disperse public demonstrations. Journalists have photographed officers at various times using batons, tear gas, and armored vehicles against protesters. Large protests against the president and his constitutional reforms in June 2022 were met with police beatings and water cannons in downtown Tunis.",2,"A 2011 decree guaranteed the freedom for NGOs to operate and outlined procedures governing the establishment of new groups. Tens of thousands of new NGOs began operating after the revolution, holding conferences, trainings, educational programs, and other events throughout Tunisia in subsequent years.However, a 2018 law effectively equates NGOs with businesses and requires them to submit to onerous reporting requirements beyond those codified in the 2011 decree. Under the law, all NGOs (and businesses) are required to register with a National Registry of Institutions, and to provide data on staff, assets, decisions to merge or dissolve, and operations. Failure to register may result in a year of imprisonment and a fine. Critics of the rules argue that they increase state monitoring and oversight of civil society. Registration applications can be denied at the discretion of the Council of the National Registry.In February 2022, Tunisian media published a leaked set of proposed amendments to laws governing civil society organizations. The draft changes would grant authorities greater latitude to block or dissolve associations and restrict their access to foreign funding.",2,"The constitution adopted in July 2022, like its 2014 predecessor, guarantees the right to form labor unions and to strike, with exceptions for the military, security forces, and customs officials. The new charter also prohibits strikes by judges, who had mounted a strike in June to protest the president’s purge of the judiciary. Large-scale strike actions have occurred across all sectors of the economy since the 2011 revolution, with participants demanding labor reform, better wages, and improved workplace conditions. Unions have reported that some employers take steps to discourage union activities, including the dismissal of union activists.The Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT) is the predominant union organization, though independent unions also exist. The UGTT has played a significant role in brokering political agreements during moments of crisis since 2011. In late 2021 it began to push President Saïed to move toward a broader political dialogue, and in 2022 it criticized the conduct of the December parliamentary elections. Also during the year, the UGTT galvanized societal opposition to a multibillion-dollar International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan agreement championed by the president. The union led a public-sector strike in June to protest against austerity measures that would result from the IMF deal, including public payroll cuts and subsidy reductions.",3
turkey,"Authorities routinely ban gatherings organized by government critics, while progovernment rallies are allowed and enjoy police protection. Police frequently use force to break up peaceful protests. In 2022, security forces used tear gas, pepper spray, and other violent tactics to disperse demonstrators at May Day protests, Istanbul and Ankara LGBT+ pride parades, Women’s Day celebrations, marches against gender-based violence (GBV), protests against price hikes and soaring inflation, and other major gatherings. Police arrested dozens of protesters at the Ankara pride parade, and more than 200 people at the Istanbul pride parade.The police routinely break up the weekly vigils and commemorations organized by the Saturday Mothers, a group that protests forced disappearances associated with a 1980 coup d’état, and arrest members of the group, most of whom are elderly women. In June 2022, the police took 16 human rights defenders at the group’s 900th vigil into custody. A trial against 46 demonstrators who attended the 700th Saturday Mothers vigil in 2018 is ongoing.Authorities cracked down on music festivals, a staple of cultural life for Turkish youth, in 2022. Governors and mayors in multiple provinces canceled or banned at least 12 music festivals and concerts between May and August, using various pretexts including environmental concerns. Festival organizers argued that they had all the necessary permits and saw no grounds for the cancelations.",1,"The government frequently targets independent civil society groups. Since 2016, it has shut down more than 1,500 foundations and associations. Leaders of remaining NGOs face harassment, arrests, and prosecutions. A 2020 law subjects NGOs to yearly audits and gives the Interior Ministry the power to appoint trustees to the boards of NGOs facing criminal investigation. In 2021, the government froze the assets of 770 NGOs on the spurious grounds of terrorism financing.Turkey’s politicized judiciary has convicted several prominent human rights activists, including the former head of Amnesty International Turkey, on bogus terrorism charges in an apparent effort to intimidate civil society actors and stifle human rights advocacy. In March 2022, police raided the homes of and detained 24 women’s rights defenders in the Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir. Of them, 11 were arrested on terrorism charges two days later, and the entire episode prompted condemnation from Turkish human rights groups. In April, an Istanbul court convicted prominent philanthropist Osman Kavala and seven other celebrated civil society leaders of conspiring to overthrow the government. Kavala was sentenced to life in prison, while the other defendants received 18-year sentences. The events drew sharp criticism from international and domestic rights groups, and the ECHR in July ruled that Turkey had violated its previous, 2019 ruling calling for Kavala’s release.Also in April, a court upheld a prison sentence for human rights lawyer and co-chair of the Human Rights Association (İHD), Eren Keskin, who since 2016 has faced multiple charges relating to terrorism membership and insulting the government. The İHD’s other co-chair, Öztürk Türkdoğan, was acquitted that month of the same charge, but still faces two additional criminal proceedings.",1,"Union activity, including the right to strike, is limited by law and in practice. Anti-union activities by employers are common and legal protections are poorly enforced. A system of threshold requirements limits unions’ ability to secure collective-bargaining rights. Trade unions and professional organizations face government interference and retaliation for activities disruptive to authorities’ wishes, such as when a 2018 strike organized to protest unsafe working conditions on the site of the new Istanbul airport was broken up. Union leaders are frequently arrested during annual May Day demonstrations.",1
turkmenistan,"The constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, and the 2015 Law on Assemblies defines the right of individuals and groups to hold peaceful gatherings with prior authorization. However, the law grants officials broad discretion to block assemblies, and the authorities do not allow organized antigovernment demonstrations. In February 2022, a rare protest took place in Bayramaly, Mary Province, after police sought to dismantle a temporary informal bazaar, which had gone up after COVID-19 restrictions shut the central bazaar. The authorities eventually gave in to the protesters’ demands and allowed the bazaar to remain in place.",0,"Onerous registration and regulatory requirements effectively prevent most independent nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from operating legally or receiving foreign funding, and activities by unregistered groups can draw fines, detention, and other penalties.

uganda,"Freedom of assembly for political opposition is severely restricted in Uganda. From 2013 until early 2020, the police imposed the Public Order Management Act (POMA), which required prior registration with local police to hold any public meeting. While POMA was annulled in March 2020, the decision was appealed to the Supreme Court—which had as of December 2022 not made a ruling—and that same month, strict COVID-19 restrictions went into effect. These were then similarly used to restrict public gatherings, particularly those organized by the political opposition. Police and security forces enforced restrictions violently and without respect for due process, resulting in injury and arbitrary detention.",1,"Civil society in Uganda is active, and several NGOs address politically sensitive issues. However, their operations are vulnerable to legal restrictions, burdensome registration requirements, and intimidation. Human rights NGOs have reported office break-ins and burglaries; police have failed to adequately investigate the incidents. In September 2022, four human rights activists were arrested as they marched to Parliament to petition for action on behalf of Ugandan migrant workers.Other government requirements restrict civic space, including one from 2019 forcing NGOs to inform the National Bureau for NGOs on staffing, finances, and activities. That November, some 12,000 NGOs were closed for failing to renew their registration. In 2022, the government continued to close NGOs for failing to comply with legal requirements, including those working on human rights issues like rights for LGBT+ people. In October, authorities established a new requirement for NGOs to register with the Personal Data Protection Office, providing organizations less than a month to complete the registration. The swiftness of the law, as well as the arbitrary nature of the requirement, is consistent with the tactics the government has used since 2019 shut down civil society groups. The deadline to register was later extended until the end of November.",1,"Workers’ rights to organize, bargain collectively, and strike are recognized by law, except for workers providing essential government services. As of 2020, there were 42 trade unions in Uganda, representing about a million people. Most are grouped under two umbrella entities—the National Organization of Trade Unions (NOTU) and the Central Organization of Free Trade Unions (COFTU). Despite legal and institutional protections, trade unions have been undermined by government co-optation, intimidation, and manipulation designed to frustrate their organizing and bargaining efforts. While some unions cater to informal workers, they generally prioritize the formal sector.",2
ukraine,"The constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly but requires organizers to give the authorities advance notice of demonstrations. Ukraine lacks a law governing the conduct of demonstrations and specifically providing for freedom of assembly.	Following the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian officials invoked martial law, which, among other effects, restricted the constitutional guarantee of freedom of assembly. Most public protests that took place across Ukraine in 2022 were mounted in opposition to the invasion.",3,"Numerous civic groups can influence decision-making at various levels of government. Ukraine’s civil society mobilized significant resources to support Ukraine’s defense and humanitarian needs in 2022. Polling data suggested that over a third of all Ukrainians had volunteered to help fellow citizens or aid the defense effort.Civil society organizations are required to disclose their ultimate beneficiaries and ownership structure under money-laundering legislation; leaders of many groups have characterized this as interference in their work. In 2022, under martial law, civil society organizations were banned from using foreign bank transactions. However, Ukrainian lawmakers allowed such groups and individual volunteers who transferred charity funds to combatants and employees of security agencies to be exempted from income tax. Some civil society activists face intimidation and threats, and law enforcement agencies fail to bring all perpetrators to justice.",2,"Trade unions function in the country, but strikes and worker protests are infrequent, as the largest trade union, stemming from the Soviet-era labor federation, lacks independence from the government and employers. Factory owners still pressure their workers to vote according to the owners’ preferences.

In July 2022, in defiance of numerous objections from the international community and trade unions in the country, Ukraine’s parliament adopted a new labor code that effectively stripped employees of companies with fewer than 250 employees of any legal protection—making pay structure, working hours, and the conditions or terms of contract termination subject to the employer’s discretion. Zelenskyy ratified the law in August, adding a last-minute qualification under pressure from trade unions that the measure would only be applicable while the country was under martial law. It was estimated that more than 70 percent of the Ukrainian workforce was affected by this change. The government claimed that the new code was meant to alleviate difficulties faced by companies during wartime, but given that it was first proposed in 2021, some argued that the government was exploiting the invasion to advance a deregulation agenda.",2

They can seek collective redress for grievances through state mediation or the courts, and the government sometimes arranges concessions and settlements. Workers occasionally protest against unpaid wages and poor working and living conditions, but such demonstrations are typically dispersed by security personnel, and noncitizens who participate risk deportation. Professional associations require government licenses and are closely monitored by the authorities.In May 2022, food-delivery drivers accused the London-based firm Deliveroo of violating the UAE’s labor laws and went on strike to protest reductions in pay and increases in working hours. The rare strike action forced the company to suspend its planned changes to compensation and scheduling.",1
united-states,"In general, officials respect the constitutional right to public assembly. Demonstrations on political and other topics are common and typically proceed without incident, though local authorities often place restrictions on the location or duration of large protests. Legislative initiatives aiming to criminalize or stiffen penalties for certain forms of protest, or to shield perpetrators of violence against protesters from legal liability, have been proposed in most states over the past decade. A total of 39 states enacted such laws between 2017 and the end of 2022.In recent years, large protests and aggressive law enforcement responses have been sparked by highly publicized police killings of Black civilians, many of which were recorded on video. In May 2020, outrage over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis inspired one of the largest waves of protests in US history. Under the banner of the decentralized Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, marches involving millions of people occurred in hundreds of cities and smaller communities. An overwhelming majority of the protests were peaceful, but in some settings they were accompanied by violence against police and significant damage to public and private property. Aggressive police tactics often contributed to violent episodes, and hundreds of instances of unprovoked or disproportionate police violence were documented on video.Police officers rarely face punishment for violence against protesters, including in cases of apparent abuse caught on camera during the 2020 protests. Observers that year also noted that police often exercised greater restraint toward anti-BLM counterprotesters and participants in separate demonstrations against COVID-19-related restrictions, many of whom were armed and displayed far-right or White supremacist symbols.With the exception of the January 2021 attack on Congress, conditions surrounding mass assemblies were generally more peaceful in 2021 and 2022.",4,"US laws and practices give wide freedom to NGOs and activists to pursue their civic or policy agendas, including those that directly oppose government policies. Organizations committed to the protection of civil liberties, immigrants’ rights, equality for women and minority groups, and freedom of speech became more active during the Trump administration and remained so in 2022, mounting campaigns and filing lawsuits to block government actions that they considered harmful. A number of privately supported NGO projects have also been established in recent years to address deficiencies in the electoral and criminal justice systems.",4,"Federal law generally guarantees trade unions the right to organize and engage in collective bargaining. The right to strike is also legally protected for most workers, though many public employees are prohibited from striking. Over the years, the strength of organized labor has declined, and just 6 percent of the private-sector workforce belonged to unions in 2022. While public-sector unions had a higher rate of membership, with 33.1 percent, they have come under pressure as well. The overall unionization rate in 2022 was 10.1 percent, down slightly from 10.3 percent in 2021. The country’s labor code and decisions by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) during Republican presidencies have been regarded as impediments to organizing efforts, but Democratic administrations, which are generally more supportive of union interests, have failed to reverse the deterioration. Union organizing is also hampered by resistance from private employers. Among other tactics, many employers categorize workers as contractors or use rules pertaining to franchisees to prevent organizing.A 2018 Supreme Court ruling that government employees cannot be required to contribute to unions representing them in collective bargaining has led to losses in union membership, and 27 states have “right-to-work” legislation in place, allowing private-sector workers who benefit from union bargaining to similarly opt out of paying union dues or fees. In 2021 the House of Representatives passed the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would strengthen organizing and bargaining capacity by overriding right-to-work laws and giving more categories of workers the right to unionize, among other changes, but the bill was blocked by Senate Republicans.A labor shortage that accompanied the economic recovery from the pandemic starting in 2021 emboldened many workers to make demands in negotiations with employers, leading to a series of highly publicized strikes and increased media coverage of labor disputes, though the total number of strikers remained relatively small. Such coverage continued in 2022, focusing on high-profile organizing efforts at the coffeehouse chain Starbucks and the online retailer Amazon. While workers made gains, including through successful unionization drives at scores of Starbucks locations, employers responded with aggressive antiunion campaigns. Labor advocates applauded the NLRB’s increased enforcement efforts against unlawful tactics but described them as insufficient to level the playing field. Separately, President Biden was criticized by some organizers and advocates for intervening in late November to avert a railroad strike; he signed legislation in early December to impose a contract that had been rejected by rank-and-file rail workers in several unions.",3
united-kingdom,"Freedom of assembly is generally respected, though peaceful protesters have found themselves under police surveillance for attending public events in recent years.Assembly rights were also affected by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act (PCSCA) 2022, which received royal assent in April. Among other things, the PCSCA gives police in England and Wales more power to determine if a protest may cause “serious disorder.” Authorities may restrict individual protesters’ actions under the law. The Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner criticized the PCSCA in December, saying it would have a “chilling” effect on peaceful assembly. PCSCA provisions against protests based on “noise” went unused as of December.The House of Commons voted in favor of the Public Order Bill, which would restrict protests that are considered overly disruptive, in October 2022; the bill did not attain final parliamentary approval or royal assent by year’s end.In March 2022, High Court judges ruled that police had breached speech and assembly rights in their policing of a public vigil held in memory of Sarah Everard, a woman who was murdered by a Metropolitan Police officer in 2021.

In response to the protests, Uzbekistan’s security forces launched an extremely violent crackdown, using lethal force against mostly peaceful protesters; the government also temporarily imposed a state of emergency, enacted martial law, and restricted mobile network coverage and internet access in the region. At least 21 people were killed and more than 270 were injured during the protests, including members of the security forces.

zambia,"Freedom of assembly is constitutionally guaranteed. While that freedom has not been consistently respected by the government, fewer police bans and assembly restrictions were imposed in 2022 compared to previous years.
