afghanistan,"Decision-making within the IEA is highly opaque. Its leader was proclaimed, not elected. There is no national legislature to check the leadership. A council of ministers functions in Kabul but Akhundzada and his advisers, who are based in Kandahar, hold ultimate authority.",0,"The Taliban claim to have achieved progress in checking widespread corruption present under the republic, particularly in the field of revenue collection. However, institutional safeguards have been weakened. In December 2022, a regime spokesman said the work of the Anti-Corruption Commission had been suspended for financial reasons but would resume.Petty corruption has also been reported under the current regime. Individuals seeking passports, for example, have had to pay bribes.",1,There is no transparency in Taliban governance and decision-making. The national budget released in May 2022 did not include significant detail. Ministers provided few details of their ministries’ activities and avoided questions in public accountability sessions held in August and September.,0
albania,"Since coming to power in 2017, the PS has largely been able to formulate and implement policy, though its ability to do so was somewhat impacted by a February 2019 opposition boycott. The potential for boycotts in the Assembly may weaken legislative oversight of the government.",3,"Corruption is pervasive, and the European Union (EU) has repeatedly called for rigorous implementation of antigraft measures, particularly for corruption within the judiciary. In 2016, constitutional reforms established the Special Anticorruption Structure, which is tasked with investigating and prosecuting high-level corruption.In a process monitored by EU and US experts, the government began vetting judges and prosecutors in 2018, to detect and combat corruption within the judiciary. A 2021 European Commission report praised Albania’s anticorruption efforts, specifically noting the success of judicial vetting. In February 2022, the Assembly extended the mandate of vetting bodies to the end of 2024.",2,"A robust access-to-information law is not well implemented. Public procurement processes and public finances are frequently opaque, though parliamentary procedures are more open.",2
algeria,"The military has historically served as the ultimate arbiter of policy disputes in Algeria, and elected leaders have relied on its support to maintain office. The loss of military backing played a significant role in Bouteflika’s resignation in 2019. The army chief of staff continues to wield considerable influence over the administration of President Tebboune.",1,"Inadequate anticorruption laws, a lack of official transparency, low levels of judicial independence, and bloated bureaucracies contribute to widespread corruption at all levels of government. Anticorruption investigations that do occur are often used to settle scores between factions within the regime. The constitutional reforms passed in 2020 included provisions for a transparency and anticorruption authority, as well as a ban on combining roles in public office and private business.A number of Bouteflika’s former political and economic allies have received harsh prison sentences as part of the anticorruption campaign that followed his resignation. In August 2022, former prime minister Noureddine Bedoui was detained in connection with a corruption investigation. In December, former finance minister Mohamed Loukal, who first came under scrutiny in 2019, was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment on corruption charges.Whistleblowers have few legal protections, and those safeguards that exist often go unenforced in practice. Several high-profile whistleblowers have faced retaliation from the government in recent years. In March 2022, Mohamed Benhalima, a former army officer who fled the country in 2019 after participating in the Hirak protests, was extradited to Algeria from Spain on dubious charges related to his purported involvement with the banned Rachad movement. While living abroad, Benhalima had publicly exposed corruption within the military through his posts on social media. He faced at least 30 charges for his activism, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison on an initial set of three charges in August. Some human rights organizations reported that Benhalima was also sentenced to death by a military court on charges of “espionage and desertion.”",1,"Algeria lacks access-to-information legislation. There is considerable opacity surrounding official decision-making procedures, the publication of official acts is rarely timely, and rules on asset disclosure by government officials are weak and poorly enforced. The 2020 constitutional revision introduced a requirement for all appointed and elected officials to declare their assets at the beginning and end of their terms, and obliges the public administration to justify its decisions within a time period to be determined by law. While the revised constitution nominally guarantees the right to access information, it includes vague exceptions for “the rights of others, the legitimate interests of businesses, and the requirements of national security.”",1
andorra,"Elected representatives generally exercise their powers without improper influence from unelected or nonstate actors. However, in recent years the Vatican has threatened to ask the bishop of La Seu d’Urgell, Joan-Enric Vives i Sicília, to resign as co-prince if the Andorran government were to decriminalize abortion, a move that would likely cause a constitutional crisis. Similar threats were made in 2009 by the other co-prince, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who stated that he would resign if Andorra failed to reform its banking system. Neither co-prince is elected, directly or indirectly, by Andorran voters.",3,"Government corruption is not viewed as a pressing issue in Andorra. Over the past several years, the government has made progress on financial-sector reforms designed to prevent abuses of the country’s banking system that could facilitate domestic or transnational corruption. Nonresidents must make certain disclosures about their bank accounts. In 2021, Parliament approved a transparency law that requires its members to report conflicts of interests and declare their assets. Nevertheless, the Council of Europe (CoE)’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) noted in a 2021 report a lack of progress with other anticorruption legislation.",4,"The government operates openly in practice. Among other resources, it publishes a regular bulletin, accessible online, that documents government activity, budgetary processes, public procurement, and asset disclosures. Since 2017, the Ministry of Territorial Planning has sponsored a participatory budget process, allowing members of the public to help set spending priorities. A 2021 transparency law requires authorities to provide information on the remuneration of civil servants and senior officials, as well as on public tenders and contracts.",4
angola,"Governmental power is highly centralized in the presidency. The president is able to legislate by decree on key subjects without public discussion, and Lourenço regularly does so in practice. The National Assembly, which remains under the control of the ruling MPLA, acts largely as a rubber stamp in approving the president’s policies.",1,"After decades of MPLA rule, corruption and patronage have become entrenched in nearly all segments of public and private life. A few high-profile associates of former president José Eduardo dos Santos have been convicted of corruption in recent years, including his son, José Filomeno dos Santos, whose 2020 guilty verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2021. The former president’s daughter, Isabel dos Santos, has been accused of siphoning public funds from the state oil firm, Sonangol; she was ordered to return $500 million in shares to the company by an international arbitration court in 2021. However, senior officials who are not directly connected to the family of former president dos Santos have rarely been brought to trial.",1,"Government operations are generally opaque. In 2018, the government announced the formation of the National Oil, Gas, and Biofuels Agency (ANPG) to oversee the industry beginning in 2019. However, its leadership was drawn from that of Sonangol.",0
antigua-and-barbuda,"The elected prime minister, cabinet, and parliament determine government policies. There are some concerns about the influence of businesses on policymaking.Tensions between the central government and residents and representatives from Barbuda have grown as the government has sought to weaken the Barbuda Land Act of 2007, which guaranteed that land on Barbuda was communally owned by Barbudans and that their consent was required for its purchase and development. The Barbuda Council has resisted the Browne government’s plans to develop the island. In 2020, the Council called for the secession of Barbuda, while the government accused the Council of treason and threatened to remove it from the country’s constitution.",3,"Government corruption remains a concern, and anticorruption laws are enforced unevenly. Authorities have been criticized for doing little to investigate local official wrongdoing in several high-profile cases.Antigua’s Citizenship by Investment (CBI) Program and Permanent Residence Certificate, in which individuals can be granted citizenship or residency in exchange for a sizable business investment or contribution, have been scrutinized in recent years. In March 2022, US legislators introduced the No Travel for Traffickers Act, making countries that operate CBI programs ineligible for the US visa waiver program. Also in March, Antigua suspended CBI applications from Russian and Belarusian nationals in response to the full-scale Russian military invasion of Ukraine. The European Parliament recommended in March that visa-free access into the European Union (EU) for countries operating CBIs should be restricted.",2,"The government of Antigua and Barbuda has gradually improved its accountability structures, but there are deficiencies in how the Public Accounts Committee and the auditor general operate. Public officials must disclose all income, assets and personal gifts received in their official capacity in a confidential report to the Integrity Commission. Resource deficiencies have impeded the commission’s ability to investigate corrupt individuals. Despite the Procurement and Contract Management Act of 2011, concerns remain about public procurement—notably regarding the expertise of procurement officials, the completeness of documentation, and that some applications are made retroactively, often with a waiver being requested.",3
argentina,"Elected officials are duly installed without interference. The political system is characterized by a powerful executive, with the president having authority to implement some policies by decree, bypassing the legislative branch. Provincial governors are also powerful and tend to influence national lawmakers representing their provinces.Vice President Fernández de Kirchner handpicked Alberto Fernández (no relation) as presidential candidate and has been the driving force behind the ruling coalition. Several ministers and lawmakers answer personally to her. Growing divisions between them have weakened the president’s authority.",3,"A weak institutional framework hampers anticorruption efforts. The country’s main anticorruption body is part of the executive, legislative oversight is scarce, and the judiciary is widely considered to be politicized and ineffectual, especially at the provincial level. Many politicians hold immunity in connection with their elected posts, and are thus protected from legal consequences for corrupt behavior.In recent years, incumbent vice president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has been the subject of numerous investigations for alleged corruption during her 2007–15 presidential term. In December 2022, Fernández de Kirchner was found guilty of fraud for improperly awarding approximately $1 billion in public contracts to a family friend while serving as president. Fernández de Kirchner—Argentina’s first vice president to be convicted of a crime while in office—has condemned the conviction as politically motivated. She was sentenced to six years in prison and permanently banned from holding public office, but the sentence will not be imposed until the appeals process is complete.",2,"An agency to guarantee access to public information was created by law in 2017 but is not independent of the presidency. Adherence to and enforcement of public-asset disclosure regulations is inconsistent. Though the Constitution requires the head of the cabinet to appear before Congress monthly to report on the government’s progress and answer questions, this rarely happens in practice.The national government has endeavored to digitize records and procedural documents, but local and provincial governments have been slower in this work.",3
armenia,"Through its significant majority, gained in a free and fair election, the Civil Contract Party controlled parliamentary decision-making after the June 2021 snap elections. Though Prime Minister Pashinyan promised to loosen the influence of business over policymaking, two wealthy businessmen entered the parliament from his party list. Some opposition parliamentarians also maintain close ties to businesspeople. Since facilitating the November 2020 cease-fire agreement that paused the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia wields increased influence in Armenia as the main mediator in Armenian-Azerbaijani negotiations and has deployed military forces across the Armenian-Azerbaijani borders. In May, opposition groups in the parliament boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded the prime minister’s resignation due to Pashinyan’s handling of the conflict with Azerbaijan. However, the opposition groups failed to gain public support and dismantled their tents after two months of blockading the center of Yerevan. They continued boycotting parliamentary sessions until mid-November.",2,"Relationships between politicians, public servants, and businesspeople have historically influenced policy and contributed to selective application of the law. High-level government officials are rarely investigated despite clear evidence of improper uses of their office. Though the government attempted to investigate past wrongdoings and fortify anticorruption mechanisms after the revolution, those measures were significantly hindered by security challenges following the 2020 war.In November 2022, the new Anti-Corruption Court and the Anti-Corruption Chamber of the Court of Cassation went into effect after legislation created the two bodies in April 2021. Though authorities have initiated high-profile corruption investigations, no charges have been brought forward. In August 2022, prosecutors initiated lawsuits to recover stolen assets from allegedly corrupt former officials from the prerevolution regime. In November, Mnatsakan Martirosyan’s election as an Anti-Corruption Court judge sparked controversy, as several of his rulings in politically charged cases had been overturned by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).",2,"Transparency has historically been limited, and enforcement of asset-declaration rules for public officials has been weak. In 2020, the parliament made strides in enhancing transparency, including by strengthening asset-declaration requirements, though a lack of transparency and accountability persists. Prime Minister Pashinyan no longer conducts in-person press conferences with journalists, instead conducting them online, which has been criticized by local media groups.",2
australia,The freely elected government is generally able to develop and implement policy.,4,"Laws against official corruption are generally well enforced, but the absence of a federal anticorruption body has made enforcement more difficult. All states and territories operate local anticorruption bodies.After coming to power in 2022, Labor introduced legislation to create a National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), which passed the House of Representatives and the Senate in late November. The NACC will have retrospective powers to investigate a broad range of conduct by public officials. Though the NACC’s inclusive definition of corrupt conduct received praise, other elements received criticism from some legislators and transparency experts, notably the fact that the legislation as drafted only allows for public hearings in exceptional circumstances.",4,"Government operations are characterized by a high degree of transparency, and political affairs are openly discussed in Parliament and in the media. Parliamentary records and commissioned reports are readily available. The Freedom of Information (FOI) Act allows people to access a wide range of government documents, though some government agencies have been criticized for long delays and unnecessary refusals of FOI requests.In August 2022, it emerged in a series of reports that, while serving as prime minister, Scott Morrison had secretly appointed himself cominister of five portfolios between March 2020 and May 2021. In addition to the premiership, Morrison was jointly serving as minister of health, minister of finance, minister of industry, science, energy and resources (ISER), treasurer, and minister of home affairs—giving him power over 6 of the 14 departments of state. Morrison justified his self-appointments as a contingency plan should the responsible ministers contract COVID-19. Morrison denied ever exercising the powers granted by the secret appointments except in one case where he intervened in an offshore gas exploration matter.There was significant criticism, from both the media and political class, of Morrison’s conduct, including of his justification for the self-appointments and the secrecy surrounding them. Notably, three of Morrison’s own cabinet ministers were unaware he had appointed himself to their portfolios; one of those former ministers, Karen Andrews, who had unknowingly jointly administered the home affairs ministry with Morrison, publicly called for him to resign from Parliament over the scandal.While legal advice given to the Albanaese government by the Australian solicitor general found that Morrison’s self-appointments were valid and had not breached any laws, it also found that Morrison’s secrecy over the appointments was inconsistent with the constitutional principle of responsible government. The advice noted that, because Morrison’s appointment was not publicly known, and because Morrison was legally and politically responsible for the administration of the departments within his ministerial remit, there was no means by which he could be held accountable for any actions he took or did not take. Following the November publication of a scathing report into the self-appointments by former High Court justice Virginia Bell, Morrison became the first former Australian prime minister to be censured by Parliament.

austria,"The freely elected president and legislative representatives work with the chancellor, vice chancellor, and cabinet ministers to determine the policies of the government.",4,"Public-sector corruption is problematic, and the political class is widely perceived as corrupt. The Council of Europe (CoE)’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) has criticized Austria for failing to regulate lobbying and prevent corruption. Investigations related to Ibizagate—which began with the 2019 release of a video of then FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache offering state contracts in exchange for donations and favorable media coverage—continued in 2021 and 2022. Strache was found guilty of corruption in August 2021 and given a 15-month suspended sentence. An appeal was pending as of year-end 2022. Strache was also tried on separate corruption charges in June 2022, based on allegations that he had awarded board positions at a state-owned company in return for donations to an FPÖ-linked organization. He was acquitted in July.In recent years, the corruption prosecutor’s office has investigated numerous allegations of false testimony, bribery, and corruption involving senior FPÖ and ÖVP politicians, including former chancellor Kurz. High-level corruption investigations continued in 2022, including into the president of the National Council, Wolfgang Sobotka, who has been implicated in numerous corruption scandals. Following a 2019 EU directive requiring member states to pass laws implementing rights and obligations regarding whistleblowers, the government drafted a bill in June 2022 that would introduce far-reaching measures to protect whistleblowers. The act had not been passed at year’s end.",3,"Austria’s government has frequently been criticized for inadequate transparency. Official secrecy remains enshrined in the constitution, and Austria’s overall legal framework on access to information is weak.In February 2021, the ÖVP–Green Party government agreed on a draft Freedom of Information Act, which would provide for the end of official secrecy; the draft had not passed as of year-end 2022. The draft legislation has been criticized as weak and overly narrow by information rights groups.",3
azerbaijan,"Neither the president nor members of parliament are freely or fairly elected, and the parliament is unable to serve as a meaningful check on the powerful presidency. Lawmakers and lower-level elected officials essentially carry out the instructions of the ruling party.",0,"Corruption is pervasive. In the absence of a free press and independent judiciary, officials are held accountable for corrupt behavior only when it suits the needs of a more powerful or well-connected figure. In 2022, multiple high-ranking officials were arrested on corruption charges in the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan. Investigative reports published by foreign media in recent years have revealed evidence that the Aliyev family has used their positions to amass large private fortunes. The resources were reportedly used in part to improperly influence the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in order to minimize criticism of electoral conduct and alleged rights abuses. In 2021, the Pandora Papers—an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)—revealed that a network of offshore companies linked to Aliyev’s family had traded around £400 million ($522.1 million) in property in the United Kingdom since 2006.In June 2022, independent news outlet Abzas Media released a report showing that businesses connected to high-ranking officials—including companies linked to Aliyev’s wife and daughters—have been awarded government contracts to develop agricultural land on the territories Azerbaijan gained during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.",0,"Government operations are opaque.

bahamas,Freely elected officials are generally unhindered in determining policy.,4,"Anticorruption mechanisms are relatively weak. There is no agency specifically empowered to handle allegations of government corruption. Rates of reporting corruption are low, as whistleblowers fear retaliation. The PLP vowed to establish an independent anticorruption body and an ombudsman after taking power but did not do so by the end of 2022.In June 2022, FNM parliamentarian Adrian Gibson was charged with abuse of power while he served as chairman of the WSC. Gibson had stepped down as chairman in 2021 after facing allegations of misconduct. His trial is expected to begin in 2023.",3,"Government procurement processes lack transparency, and political parties and campaigns are not required to disclose their finances. Legislators and other high-ranking public officials must disclose their income and assets annually under the Public Disclosure Act but often fail to submit the required information on time, without penalty.The Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2019 aims to improve transparency of public-sector spending. The FRA created an independent oversight and enforcement body, the Fiscal Responsibility Council. The Public Procurement Act (PPA), which is meant to ensure transparency in government contracts, took effect in 2021. In October 2022, Prime Minister Davis tabled a new bill to replace the PPA, calling it “deficient.”The Bahamian government faced criticism over the collapse of FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in the United States in November 2022. FTX collapsed after a press report suggested that chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried used FTX’s cryptocurrency as collateral in other loans, prompting customers to withdraw from the exchange. In early November, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB) called on the national police to investigate FTX over concerns that it was mismanaging assets in a manner that amounted to a crime. In December, the SCB disclosed that it had seized FTX assets worth $3.5 billion in November and said it would return those assets to creditors and customers. The firm’s lawyers accused Bahamian regulators of colluding with Bankman-Fried to impact bankruptcy proceedings. The government in Nassau, meanwhile, vehemently objected to criticism of its conduct regarding FTX.",3
bahrain,"There are no elected officials with executive authority. The National Assembly may propose legislation, but the government drafts and submits the bills for legislative consideration. As major opposition groups are absent from the National Assembly, the body has become silent on politically sensitive topics, though it does feature debate on economic reforms, austerity measures, subsidy reforms, and public services. Bahrain is fiscally and economically dependent on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which gives their governments significant influence over its foreign policy.",0,"There are some laws in place to combat corruption, but enforcement is weak, and high-ranking officials or members of the ruling family who are suspected of corruption are rarely punished. The generally pliant parliament does not check malfeasance effectively, and the media are not sufficiently free to independently air allegations of corruption against powerful figures. Civil society anticorruption efforts are also restricted; activists who highlight such problems have been prohibited from traveling or otherwise harassed.In January 2022, a court sentenced a civil servant to seven years in prison after convicting him of embezzling fees for the renewal of expatriates’ residency permits; another defendant in the case was acquitted.",2,"Parliamentary proceedings are public, and the parliament is entitled to scrutinize the government budget, but in practice the executive issues orders and laws without providing insight or allowing meaningful public consultation.

The dearth of opposition representation in the National Parliament significantly reduces its ability to scrutinize government policies, budgets, and proposed legislation. The incumbent government’s legitimacy was also undermined by the conduct of the 2018 election, which was marred by violence, intimidation, and allegations of fraud.",1,"Corruption is widespread. Under the AL, anticorruption efforts have been weakened by politicized enforcement and subversion of the judicial process. The Anti-Corruption Commission is ineffective and subject to overt political interference. The government continues to bring or pursue politicized corruption cases against BNP leaders. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, AL politicians and government officials were accused of corruption during relief efforts. Media outlets and civil society face restrictions and are less able to expose government corruption.",1,"Endemic corruption and criminality, weak rule of law, limited bureaucratic transparency, and political polarization have long undermined government accountability.

barbados,"The prime minister and Parliament are largely unimpeded in their ability to craft and implement policy. In 2021, Barbados became a republic. Barbados’s first-past-the-post electoral system meant that a 69-percent vote for the BLP in January 2022 translated to a 100-percent share of the lower house. There is no constitutional mechanism to select a leader of the opposition in such cases, which weakens scrutiny of the government.",4,"Acts of corruption occur but with less frequency than in the rest of the region. Barbados’s government has failed to prosecute senior officials. Potential whistleblowers fear costly defamation suits. A Prevention of Corruption Act was passed in 2021, updating legislation dating back to 1929.Barbados is one of just seven countries in the Americas to have neither signed nor ratified the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. The government has signed but not ratified the UN Convention against Corruption.",3,"A Freedom of Information Act is yet to materialize.

belarus,"Though Lukashenka claimed victory in the 2020 presidential elections, the legitimacy of his office is disputed both domestically and internationally. The constitution vests power in the president, stating that presidential decrees supersede legislation. Lukashenka considers himself the head of all branches of government, including the parliament, which always supports his policies and rarely initiates legislation on its own. Observers say that constitutional amendments enacted in February 2022 further entrenched Lukashenka’s power, including by guaranteeing that after leaving office, former presidents will be granted immunity from prosecution for their actions while president and given a permanent seat in the Council of the Republic.",0,"The state controls at least 70 percent of the economy, and graft is encouraged by a lack of transparency and accountability in government. There are no independent bodies to investigate corruption cases, and graft trials are typically closed. Presidential clemency has been issued occasionally to free convicted corrupt officials, some of whom Lukashenka has returned to positions of authority.Powerful oligarchs enjoy the protection of the government and adjustment of regulations and government policies in their favor, so long as they channel money to Lukashenka in a quid pro quo arrangement. Spurious bribery and tax evasion charges have been used against Lukashenka’s political opponents and human rights activists; for example, in 2021, Viktar Babaryka was sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment on corruption charges after he announced his intentions to register as a presidential candidate.",1,"The government largely fails to adhere to legal access-to-information requirements, though authorities have moved to make some basic information about government operations available online in recent years. From August through November 2021, Lukashenka intentionally withheld information about the increased numbers of economic migrants and asylum seekers that were being allowed into the country. Journalists and human rights groups have regularly been prevented from accessing migrant camps in Belarus near the Polish border.Additionally, during 2022, the government deliberately obscured information about Belarusian involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the stationing of Russian troops in Belarus.",0
belgium,Elected officials generally adopt and implement laws and policies without improper interference from unelected entities.,4,"Public officials can face heavy fines and up to 10 years’ imprisonment for corruption-related offenses, and enforcement of anticorruption legislation is generally adequate. However, recent corruption scandals have drawn attention to abuses involving politicians who hold multiple positions on the boards of public and private entities, with some officials holding more than a dozen paid positions. The Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), a Council of Europe (CoE) anticorruption body, has repeatedly warned about Belgium’s slow implementation of recommended anticorruption reforms. Two new laws improving whistleblower protections in line with EU requirements were passed in November and December 2022. The legislation, which provides protections in both the private and public sectors, had not yet entered into force at year’s end. Several senior officials of the Walloon parliament, including its president, resigned in December 2022 after being implicated in a scandal involving the misuse of public funds. The same month, Marc Tarabella, a PS politician and member of European Parliament, was suspended from the PS following allegations that he had accepted illicit funds from Qatar. Investigations into Tarabella’s involvement in the so-called Qatargate corruption scandal were ongoing at year’s end.",3,"The law provides mechanisms for the public to access government information, and these procedures generally function in practice. Legislators and other high-ranking elected officials are required by law to regularly disclose their assets as well as paid or unpaid mandates, executive functions, and occupations to the Court of Audit.

Under the Dayton Accords, representatives from each of the three major ethnic groups, at both the state and entity levels, may exercise a veto on legislation deemed harmful to their interests. The state government is also undercut by movements within each of BiH’s entities for greater autonomy.Dodik, now the RS president, maintains expansive control over the entity, and continues to speak openly of his desire for the RS to secede from BiH. In October 2021, he announced the RS’s withdrawal from various federal institutions, notably the military, prompting fears of a secession crisis. The move came largely in response to the OHR’s July 2021 law against genocide denial and was the latest in a series of escalating efforts to chip away at the functionality of the BiH state. Dodik continued to engage in secessionist rhetoric throughout 2022, prompting additional rounds of sanctions against him and his associates by the United States and United Kingdom.",2,"Corruption remains widespread and systemic, and legislation designed to combat the problem is poorly enforced. When corruption probes are actually opened, they rarely result in convictions.",1,"Government operations remain largely inaccessible to the public. Procurement awards are often made in secret, and public institutions frequently fail to comply with freedom of information laws. Candidates for major offices are obliged to make financial disclosures, but the relevant laws are weak, and the resulting disclosures are widely considered unreliable. Debate and decisions on matters of public interest, including legislation and subjects pertaining to EU accession, routinely occur during interparty negotiations that take place behind closed doors, outside of government institutions.",1
botswana,"Elected officials determine government policies. However, opposition parties have criticized the executive for its influence over Parliament, and for rushing legislation without adequate deliberation or consultation.President Masisi was criticized for single-handedly initiating a 2022 constitutional review process without seeking input from important stakeholders, including Parliament.In July 2022 Parliament passed a bill establishing a standing committee on the remuneration of elected representatives, members of the House of Chiefs, and some other specified offices. The inclusion of ministerial appointees with voting rights in the committee was criticized by some lawmakers for fear that that would undermine the committee’s independence.In 2016, lawmakers approved an amendment increasing the number of National Assembly members appointed by the president from four to six. Opposition leaders argued that the change would strengthen executive power at the legislature’s expense.In 2018, Masisi transferred the DISS and the Financial Intelligence Agency from their respective ministries to the president’s office, prompting concerns over the improper centralization of power.",3,"Botswana has a comprehensive legislative anticorruption framework. Whistleblower-protection legislation was passed in 2016. In 2019, legislators passed the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act (DALA), and an Ethics and Integrity Directorate became operational in January 2020. However, anticorruption operations are constrained by a lack of funding.The main anticorruption agency, the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC) has been accused of ineffectiveness in pursuing high-level cases, and its independence has been questioned since it was transferred to the president’s office in 2012. In July, Parliament dismissed a legislative move, backed by civil society groups, to make the DCEC independent.The DCEC is prone to leadership instability and has had a high turnover of directors general. In June 2022, Director General Tymon Katlholo was suspended from office, a move some perceived as political interference in its work. In an appearance before a parliamentary committee that month, Katlholo said the DCEC had 215 cases with prosecuting authorities, 140 cases before the courts, and a backlog of 619 active investigations.",3,"Botswana lacks a freedom-of-information law, which limits government transparency.

A new Procurement Act, which decentralized public procurement, came into effect in 2022 and is aimed at addressing corruption and strengthening transparency and accountability. In March 2022, Botswana committed itself to a tax transparency agenda by endorsing the Yaoundé Declaration.

brazil,"Widespread corruption undermines the government’s ability to make and implement policy without undue influence from private or criminal interests.During the 2010s, the functioning of government was severely hampered by a rolling political crisis due to corruption scandals. Congressional leaders have gained political prominence during the Bolsonaro administration, which lacked a stable governing coalition. The National Congress and state governors helped fill a vacuum in responding to COVID-19, with many governors imposing stricter restrictions and objecting to Bolsonaro’s management.The presence of active-duty and retired military officials in the Bolsonaro administration, along with the expansion of military missions into areas like environmental protection and the pandemic response, prompted unease about the military’s influence in politics. The Defense Ministry was additionally responsible for examining a number of voting machines during the 2022 elections.",3,"Corruption and graft are endemic in Brazil, especially among elected officials. Between 2014 and 2021, an investigation known as Operation Car Wash focused on bribery, money laundering, and bid-rigging involving state oil company Petrobras and private construction companies.However, a series of investigative reports known as the Car Wash Leaks, published by the Intercept Brasil in 2019, exposed an improper relationship between Sérgio Moro—a judge who later became a Bolsonaro-era justice minister and won a Senate seat in 2022—and federal prosecutors. The Supreme Court annulled the convictions in 2021 on procedural grounds. Lula, who was imprisoned over corruption allegations in 2018, was released in November 2019, while his convictions were among those that were later annulled. Moro himself resigned as justice minister in 2020, after Bolsonaro attempted to interfere with the federal police, one of the agencies tasked with investigating his family and associates.Criminal inquiries have targeted multiple members of Bolsonaro’s family. By early 2021, Bolsonaro and all four of his sons faced corruption investigations. In August 2022, the UOL news outlet reported that Bolsonaro family members traded 107 properties since 1990, with federal prosecutors examining transactions on 25 of them. None of the inquiries have advanced because of the veto power of the attorney general and Bolsonaro’s presidential immunity.In March 2022, Education Minister Milton Ribeiro resigned after two pastors allegedly bribed the ministry in order to direct funding to their municipalities. Riberio was arrested on corruption charges in June, along with a pastor tied to Bolsonaro.",2,"Brazil enacted a Freedom of Information Act (LLI) in 2012, but the government does not always release requested information, and when doing so, not always in machine-readable formats. Compliance with the LLI also varies among the country’s states and municipalities. In 2019, the Bolsonaro administration modified the LLI by decree, giving a larger group of officials the power to classify information as secret.The Bolsonaro administration often decreed 100 years of secrecy on information it considered sensitive, including meetings with pastors, allegations against former health minister Eduardo Pazuello, and two of Bolsonaro’s sons’ visits to the presidential residence.The Bolsonaro administration additionally used a “secret budget,” an opaque system of financial grants that routed billions of reais through a rapporteur. Observers criticized the arrangement, which allowed lawmakers to receive added funding in exchange for backing the administration without transparency or oversight. In December 2022, the Supreme Court ruled the arrangement unconstitutional.",2

Anticorruption laws are not adequately enforced, including in high-profile cases, contributing to a culture of impunity.In 2022, during the short-lived Petkov government, actions against corrupt practices introduced by the previous GERB governments were undertaken. The state reclaimed phytosanitary control over the Bulgarian-Turkish border in May, for example (though a court later overturned the move); the previous lax controls had been criticized for allowing agricultural products with unacceptable levels of pesticides into the country, and allegedly had led to an increase in drug smuggling. Under Petkov’s administration, authorities also said they had identified billions of dollars’ worth of public construction contracts that were signed in the absence of proper procurement procedures.Meanwhile, the March 2022 arrest of former prime minister Boyko Borissov on suspicion of corrupt dealings while in office—allegations linked to investigations by the EU prosecutor’s office—did not result in charges against him. (The arrest itself was deemed illegal by a court in August, on grounds of procedural irregularities.)",2,"Although Bulgaria has laws meant to ensure that the government operates with transparency, they are only partially enforced. While the transparency in the work of Parliament, the cabinet, and municipal bodies has increased considerably in recent years, public access to information about budgets and spending of various government agencies is sometimes inadequate or presented in an inaccessible way.

All significant business deals reportedly go through the president himself.State bodies tasked with combating corruption lack the resources and independence to function effectively. Prosecutions of senior officials are rare. When senior officials are prosecuted, cases are often pursued selective and politicized. The deputy director of materials, Farah Mohamed Osman, and head of the treasury, Sahal Said Awaleh, were arrested over an alleged money laundering operation in March 2022. However, critics claim their arrest was driven by the desire to silence voices opposing the Guelleh regime rather than as part of larger efforts to clamp down on political corruption in Djibouti.",0,"The government operates in an opaque manner and resists attempts to shed light on its policymaking, budgetary, and procurement decisions. There is also little transparency on President Guelleh’s investment deals with the Chinese government and other foreign entities, which have resulted in a massive amount of public debt and spread discontent among local communities that were not consulted on the location or terms of foreign development projects.",0

In May 2022, the Anti-Corruption Office (PEPCA) confirmed that it was investigating former president Danilo Medina and his involvement in administrative corruption. The ongoing investigation into Medina’s administration had resulted in the 2020 arrest of Medina’s brother and had linked several legislators to drug trafficking and money laundering networks. In July 2022, the Organic Law of Domain Extinction, which made it easier for the government to seize foreign and domestic assets connected to illegal activity, was enacted.",2,"The government does not always operate with transparency. State agencies often provide inaccurate or incomplete responses to information requests. Public officials are required to publicly disclose assets, but NGOs have cast doubt upon the accuracy of these disclosures. Public contracting and purchasing processes are opaque, and a September 2021 report exposed millions of dollars in missing taxes from purchases of luxury and other vehicles imported under the names of Dominican legislators, who have exemptions.In a September 2022 speech to mark the beginning of an international “Open America” conference held in the Dominican Republic, President Abinader argued that an uptick in reports of corruption is a sign of a more open government because it shows that citizens are empowered to participate in governance. He also touted the findings of the 2021 Open Budget Survey, released in May 2022, in which the Dominican Republic ranked 9th in budget transparency of the 120 countries surveyed.",2
democratic-republic-congo,Massive electoral fraud and irregularities prevent democratically elected officials from determining government policies.

The state of siege was most recently renewed in December 2022.,0,"Corruption in the government, security forces, and mineral extraction industries is extensive and has corroded public services and development efforts. President Tshisekedi publicly committed the government to fighting corruption when he came to power. In 2020, Tshisekedi’s chief of staff, Vital Kamerhe, was convicted and received a 20-year forced-labor sentence for embezzling public funds. However, Kamerhe and a codefendant were cleared of embezzlement charges in June 2022. In 2021, reports revealed Israeli businessman Dan Gertler’s embezzlement of $3.7 billion in state funds through Kabila-approved contracts over several years. In February 2022, the government and Gertler signed an agreement where a Gertler-linked company would return assets that were reportedly worth over $2 billion. Civil society groups criticized the government for its lack of transparency over the deal, which was believed to favor Gertler.",1,"Despite previous incremental improvements in revenue reporting, there is little transparency in the state’s financial affairs. The law does not provide for public access to government information, and citizens often lack the practical ability to obtain records on public expenditures and state operations. Contracts for the extractive industries are conducted in secret.In 2021, some efforts were made to bring the Central Bank of Congo (BCC) into compliance with International Monetary Fund (IMF) protocols as a condition for loans. However, required financial disclosures from top officials were not made public; tax agencies suffer from poor reporting; and shadow networks determine political and financial decisions in practice. In a September 2022 technical update, the IMF reported that a bill on the BCC’s transparency and independence existed in draft form and expected its ultimate approval. The IMF authorized a disbursement of funds in December.The government is not transparent on the state’s involvement in violence in insecure areas. Military authorities, who are inaccessible to constituents, were installed in Ituri and North Kivu when a state of siege was imposed on those provinces in 2021.",0
ecuador,"Elected officials are generally free to set and implement government policy without undue interference from nonstate actors. An escalating security crisis—marked by a rapid rise in homicides and other violent crime in the country since 2021, largely driven by drug-related gang activity—poses a threat to the ability of the elected government to effectively and freely govern. Organized crime groups routinely intimidate, bribe, and attack government officials, and their presence has weakened state control of institutions, especially Ecuador’s prison system.Other nongovernmental groups have used violent tactics to influence government policies. In June 2022, large antigovernment protests led by the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon (CONAIE) saw protesters block roads and attack security forces while demanding that the government change its economic policies, among other things. The government was forced to concede to several of the protesters’ demands, including agreeing to lower fuel prices and restrict mining in protected areas.Hostility between the legislature and executive has increased in recent years, impeding government efforts to make and implement policies. In June 2022, opposition legislators moved to impeach President Lasso over “the serious political crisis and internal commotion” caused by that month’s Indigenous-led antigovernment protests. Ultimately, the opposition did not garner enough votes to impeach Lasso. ",2,"Ecuador has long been racked by corruption, and the weak judiciary and lack of investigative capacity in government oversight agencies contribute to an environment of impunity. Although the Moreno administration initially emphasized anticorruption efforts and several prominent politicians have faced investigation and prosecution in recent years, corruption scandals rocked the country during the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrating the depth of the challenge of effectively combating graft. In September 2021, the Lasso administration estimated the cost of corruption between 2007 and 2019 at approximately $68 billion. In October 2022, energy minister Xavier Vera resigned after becoming the focus of a corruption investigation that began when a local media outlet released audio recordings suggesting that Vera had exchanged jobs at the state-owned oil company PetroEcuador for payment. Other high-profile corruption probes during the year included an investigation into an alleged corruption network within PetroEcuador during the Correa administration. According to former energy secretary and PetroEcuador CEO Carlos Pareja Yannuzzelli, who testified about the case before the legislature in November, Correa was involved in a corruption scheme related to “irregular practices in oil contracting” that allegedly resulted in the loss of more than $5 billion. The investigation was ongoing as of November.",2,"The law guarantees citizens’ right to access public information.

The parliament has neither a significant role in forming and debating laws, nor the ability to provide a meaningful check on executive power. Laws originating in Sisi’s cabinet receive parliamentary approval without meaningful contestation or deliberation.The 2019 constitutional amendments further consolidated Sisi’s authority and increased the military’s constitutional role in civilian governance and already considerable independence from civilian oversight. The amendments allow the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to permanently control the appointment of the defense minister, who is also the commander in chief.",0,"Corruption is pervasive at all levels of government. Official mechanisms for investigating and punishing corrupt activity remain weak and ineffective. President Sisi controls the Administrative Control Authority, the body responsible for most anticorruption initiatives. It lacks credibility, transparency, and impartiality and is not allowed to monitor the economic activities of the military.",1,"The Sisi administration provides little transparency regarding government spending and operations and denies civil society groups and independent journalists opportunities to comment on, oversee, or influence state policies through intimidation and censorship. Although the government makes its budget documents, including debt obligations, accessible to the public, data on debt held by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) remains inaccessible. Moreover, state budget documents do not include allocations to military SOEs, and audits for large SOEs are never public. The military is notoriously opaque with its budget and extensive business interests.",1
el-salvador,"The Bukele administration repeatedly interfered with the legislature’s ability to determine policy until it gained a supermajority in the legislative session that commenced in May 2021, which enabled it to swiftly rubberstamp new laws and policies. The NI government has routinely denied opposition legislators access to key information, including draft legislation, inhibiting substantial deliberation of proposed laws. The government also makes record use of legislative process waivers, which expedites proposals for a vote within hours of submission to the legislature. Bukele has also harassed and bullied allied lawmakers from other parties who criticize NI policies or officials.",2,"Corruption including embezzlement, money laundering, and other forms of self-enrichment remains a problem in government, and anticorruption bodies and prosecutions are increasingly susceptible to politicization.In November 2020, prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into the suspected misuse of COVID-19-related funds, including the awarding of public contracts to businesses linked to politicians. However, in May 2021, the NI-controlled legislature passed a law retroactively granting public officials and contractors immunity from any civil or criminal liability stemming from pandemic-related state expenditures. Since then, more cases of suspected graft involving COVID-related funds have emerged.In 2021, the government shut down the International Commission against Impunity in El Salvador (CICIES), an OAS-supported anticorruption agency that assisted Salvadoran prosecutors.Under the guise of the state of exception that began in March 2022, the NI government removed legal administrative regulations on the use of public funds and state contracts. Further, authorities restricted the right to access public information, impeding civil society’s ability to expose corrupt actors, and passed a law that enables authority to manage public funds without adhering to the relevant law.",0,"The 2011 Access to Public Information Law instituted strong mechanisms for transparency and oversight of public institutions. While there have always been issues with compliance, government bodies have been more resistant and less transparent since the beginning of the Bukele administration. Bukele has issued executive decrees impinging on the independence of the oversight and enforcement body, the Access to Public Information Agency (IAIP), and has named partisan commissioners. Government officials continue to withhold information on expenditures, even amid widespread allegations and indications of related corruption. No government minister has submitted their asset disclosures, as required by law to detect potential corruption.NI has used its parliamentary supermajority to routinely pass laws with minimal information provided to opposition lawmakers, much less the public.

Hiring and promotions within the government, army, and civil service favor those with ties to the president and his family. Two of the president’s sons, the vice president and the minister of mines and hydrocarbons, have been the subjects of corruption cases in European courts. Although the government has taken some steps to address corruption, the efforts have been largely superficial.In March 2022, the president appointed the first members of the Court of Auditors, a monitoring body called for in a 2012 constitutional amendment. Former treasury minister Melchor Esono Edjo, a nephew of the president, was sworn in as head of the court despite past international corruption allegations and a conflict of interest related to his shares in a partially state-owned bank. In May, the president also appointed the leaders of a new anticorruption commission in keeping with a 2020 law. The effectiveness of these institutions and the differentiation of their functions remained unclear at year’s end.",0,"The government’s budget process and procurement system are opaque, as are the finances of state-owned companies. A significant percentage of revenue from the country’s oil reserves is funneled to Obiang’s allies through noncompetitive, nontransparent construction contracts. International financial organizations and human rights groups have criticized the government for pouring resources into wasteful infrastructure projects while neglecting public health and social spending.In compliance with a 2021 anticorruption law, the government released a form for asset declarations in March 2022.

eswatini,The king and his government determine policy and legislation; members of Parliament hold no real power and effectively act as a rubber stamp in approving the king’s legislative priorities. Parliament cannot initiate legislation and has little oversight or influence on budgetary matters. The king is also constitutionally empowered to veto any legislation. The absolute authority of the king was demonstrated by his decision to rename the country in 2018 without any constitutional process or parliamentary approval.,0,"Corruption is a major problem, and implicated officials generally enjoy impunity. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) is perceived to be ineffective, with civil society groups accusing it of pursuing politically motivated cases and serving the interests of the prime minister. The ACC, which reports to the Justice Ministry, lacks adequate financial and human resources and must consult with the minister on hiring. In 2018, a cabinet committee was established to develop a zero-tolerance policy on corruption in government, but its ability to create an effective anticorruption framework remains unclear. The Tibiyo Taka Ngwane (Wealth of the Nation) investment fund, managed by Mswati, has reportedly been used for the king’s personal gain, with opposition figures accusing him of using it to bolster his personal income as far back as 2011.",0,"Eswatini lacks access-to-information laws, and there is no culture of proactive disclosure of government information. Public requests for information are largely ignored in practice, and the budgeting process lacks transparency.

ethiopia,"The shortcomings of the 2021 elections, including a climate of insecurity and growing repression of some opposition groups, suggest that gains in political reform have stalled and, in the absence of stability, may eventually be reversed. The escalation of violence in Tigray, which was further worsened by the deployment of Eritrean troops, prevented the 2021 elections from occurring in the region, leaving people there without elected representatives. In November 2022, the federal government and the TPLF signed a peace treaty through talks mediated by the African Union, following a humanitarian truce that was signed in March but had broken down in August.Some areas plagued by insecurity remain out of the control of the government—such as parts of Oromia—while others have been under prolonged states of emergency, with heightened military presence and control, including parts of Oromia, Amhara, and Benishangul Gumuz.",1,"Corruption and unequal resource distribution are significant problems that have contributed to the recent civil unrest throughout Ethiopia. However, the ruling party has accused public servants or opposition politicians of corruption as a political weapon to punish dissent. Petty bribery and corruption, often involving local officials and police, are widespread. Corruption within the justice system remains a significant challenge, and judges caught accepting bribes are rarely punished.In July 2022, federal police arrested the commissioner of the National Disaster Risk Management Commission, Mitiku Kassa, on suspicion of corruption. Kassa was accused of colluding with the leader of a humanitarian organization called the Elshadai Relief and Development Association, embezzling money by selling food and clothing that were ostensibly designated for internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps. The camps that the supplies were allegedly intended for do not exist.The government established a national committee to coordinate an anticorruption campaign in November 2022. The committee announced it had received over 250 tips within a week of its creation and testified to the widespread presence of corruption, labeling it as a major threat to national security. Several current officials were implicated in land embezzlement cases. In December, several officials suspected of corruption were arrested, including Tewodros Bekele, director general of the Ethiopian Financial Security Services (EFSS). Despite these seemingly positive steps, the 2022 anticorruption campaign only focuses on malfeasance within institutions at the federal level. Whether the government intends to carry out new anticorruption investigations with integrity, without using it to repress political opposition members, is unclear.",2,"At the start of the war in Tigray internet and telephone lines were cut and journalists were denied access to the region. The involvement of Eritrean soldiers, the status of refugee camps, and the humanitarian situation in Tigray all remain shrouded in uncertainty.Very little information is available about counter-insurgency operations and ethnic conflicts in Oromia, Benishangul Gumuz, and Amhara. The extent of the human rights abuses and war crimes committed in these areas remain difficult to verify. While state media and the government’s official communications throughout 2022 emphasized the limited nature of what it has termed a “law enforcement operation,” media and other reports of alleged atrocities, sexual violence, and the expanding conflict have contradicted the government’s narrative.Amid widespread impunity for security forces, the government’s efforts to ensure accountability for the human rights abuses committed by its forces lacks transparency. ",1

The OSP published information on the status of 75 cases (five of them high-profile) that it was investigating for potential corruption, including Eunice Jacqueline Buah Asomah-Hinneh, a member of the presidential advisory body, the Council of State. However, the office of the OSP has expressed doubts as to the integrity of the government’s commitments to fighting corruption.In October 2022, the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) indicated that it was investigating 428 cases of public officials’ failure to declare their assets as required by law between 2020 and 2022.",3,"The government operates with relative transparency, though there are weaknesses in the legal framework. The Right to Information Act, which grants citizens the right to seek, access, and receive information from public as well as some private institutions, came into effect in 2020. In 2022, several media actors and stakeholders complained about barriers and impediments to accessing information in practice, including arbitrary fees that public bodies charged groups that had requested information.",3
greece,"Greek elected officials generally set and implement government policies without undue interference, and the influence of international creditor institutions has receded over the past decade.",4,"Corruption remains a problem in Greece, and institutions tasked with combating it have inadequate resources. Tax officials in past years have been implicated in tax evasion schemes, which seriously complicate the government’s fiscal reform efforts. A new criminal code and a new code of criminal procedure, adopted in 2019, allow prison time for the bribery of politicians and are more broadly aligned with relevant international conventions. However, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed serious concerns that the main active bribery offense was converted from a felony to a misdemeanor.In March 2021, a special committee was created to investigate accusations that former digital governance minister Nikos Pappas had received bribes and rigged a television licensing competition. That July, Parliament voted in favor of prosecuting Pappas through a special court in collaboration with the Judicial Council and the prosecutorial authority. After no clear evidence of bribery emerged in the pre-investigative committee, Pappas was only referred to the Supreme Court for breach of duty. In June 2022, the Supreme Court’s Judicial Council referred Pappas to a special court for his handling of the television-license tender. The Special Court, which will examine the charges of dereliction of duty, is comprised of judges from the Supreme Court and the Council of State. In mid-June 2022, former minister of justice of the SYRIZA-ANEL coalition government, Dimitris Papangelopoulos, was referred to the Supreme Court for a series of interventions he made in the judiciary while he was in office, but was only examined by the Supreme Court for two of them. In July 2022, the Supreme Court’s Judicial Council unanimously decided to refer him to the Special Court for abuse of power and subsequent breach of duty. It is the fourth time since Greece’s transition to democracy in 1974 that this Special Court has been activated. Papangelopoulos’s trial started in September 2022. The same special court also examined the former head of the corruption prosecutor’s office, Eleni Touloupaki, for abuse of power related to her failure to send a report to Parliament for further investigation. The report was filed by PASOK members of parliament against the SYRIZA-ANEL government’s health minister and his deputy, and pertained to the Novartis case, in which 10 politicians were accused of receiving donations from the pharmaceutical company Novartis. ",2,"Several laws and government programs are designed to ensure the transparency of official decisions and provide public access to information. Officials are required to make public declarations of their assets and income. Nonetheless, implementation of these transparency regulations is problematic.The transparency of state procurement contracts remains a concern. Extraordinary conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for direct procurement of public works without a call for tenders. Despite these conditions no longer existing, procurement practices have not gone back to normal.Gaps in transparency also exist with respect to public debtors. Though the state is obliged to publicize the names of debtors who owe the public sector over €150,000 ($163,000), the archive of tax and social security debtors has not been updated since 2019. In July 2022, its publication was postponed for another year.Issues with surveillance also undermine transparency. In 2022, investigative news outlets reported that the National Intelligence Service (EYP) had wiretapped the mobile phones of journalists Stavros Malihoudis, Anastasios Telloglou, and Thanasis Koukakis, and that Koukakis’s phone had also been infected by Predator spyware. In July, the National Transparency Authority (EAD)—created to tackle abuses of power—claimed it found no incriminating evidence against the government in its investigation. In August, EYP’s director admitted to a closed session of the parliamentary Committee on Institutions and Transparency that the intelligence agency had carried out surveillance of Koukakis as a matter of national security.Also in August, the Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) revealed that the mobile phone of Nikos Androulakis, leader of Greece’s third largest political party and a member of the European Parliament, was wiretapped in 2021. While the government claimed that spying on Androulakis’s phone was wrong but legal, the chief of EYP and the general secretary to the prime minister subsequently resigned. Despite pressure from opposition politicians and journalists to reveal the rationale for spying on Androulakis, the government did not offer a justification and argued that it was a matter of national security. In September, a parliamentary inquiry was opened, but only examined a small number of witnesses, despite the disagreement of opposition parties.In November, a newspaper published the names of over 30 politicians, journalists, entrepreneurs, chief defense and police officials, along with their partners, who were targeted by surveillance.Though the government introduced the Act of Legislative Content in August, it did not repeal a 2021 provision that prevents ADAE from retroactively informing targets about surveillance measures taken against them for reasons of National Security. In December 2022, parliament began considering a draft surveillance law that academics and human rights organizations argued lacks effective privacy and human rights safeguards.",2
grenada,The appointed prime minister and cabinet and freely elected representatives are able to determine the policies of the government.,4,"Corruption remains a prominent issue in Grenada, despite safeguards enshrined in the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Integrity in Public Life Act. Several suggested amendments in a 2016 constitutional reform package would have strengthened anticorruption safeguards, but all were voted down by significant margins.Grenada’s Citizenship by Investment program, which allows foreigners to gain citizenship through an economic investment in the country, continues to trouble some analysts due to the potential for fraud and abuse, despite the tightening of rules governing it.Since taking power, the NDC government accused the former NNP government of corruption. In September 2022, Tevin Andrew, the minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique affairs, said that his ministry had been seriously affected by corruption. In late October, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell alleged that the former NNP government accepted funds in return for a diplomatic passport and diverted some of that money into an NNP-linked constituency account days before the June polls. In November, former foreign minister Oliver Joseph disclosed that the NNP government accepted funds for diplomatic passports as a policy, but denied wrongdoing on the former government’s part.Other government bodies and civil society groups faced scrutiny over their conduct in 2022. In September, the Integrity Commission reported significant failings at the state-owned Marketing and National Importing Board (MNIB) and called for a forensic audit. The Integrity Commission had launched its investigation after a former MNIB chief executive was accused of misusing funds. Also in September, the NDC government launched an investigation into the FAITH Organization for People’s Development, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) with ties to the NNP, after documents revealed that the NGO had received considerably more government funding than other groups.",3,The government of Grenada generally operates with transparency. All public officials are required to declare their assets. An appointed commission monitors and verifies declarations but does not disclose them publicly except in court. Grenadian laws permit authorities to request financial information about its citizens residing abroad in an effort to prevent tax avoidance. The Fiscal Responsibility Oversight Committee has noted that the opacity of data involving state-run entities and other financial liabilities has impeded it from fulfilling its role.There is no law to ensure public access to information.,3
guatemala,"The elected government and legislature determine government policies, but they are frequently subject to influence by outside interests. President Giammattei came to the presidency backed by a group of former military officials; such networks possess significant economic power and frequently oppose the peace process that Guatemala has been fitfully implementing since 1996. Business groups continue to hold significant sway over all branches of government, and serve on the governing bodies of various public institutions. Organized crime groups have penetrated state institutions.",2,"Corruption, which is often related to organized crime, remains a serious problem. Since the 2019 closure of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), authorities and lawmakers have obstructed the fight against corruption; prosecutions have stalled; and many high-profile cases have lost momentum or are being taken apart. Judges, prosecutors, and civil society actors committed to tackling corruption have increasingly been the targets of physical attacks, threats, malicious lawsuits, and defamation campaigns. As of October 2022, at least 25 judges and prosecutors have been forced into exile. Since assuming office in 2018, Attorney General María Consuelo Porras has fired, transferred, or initiated frivolous cases against numerous anticorruption prosecutors and independent judges. In 2021, Porras conducted the unlawful and arbitrary removal of the head of the Special Prosecutor’s Office against Impunity (FECI). In June and July 2022 alone, Porras removed 8 prosecutors and 11 administrative officials. Recent investigations of electoral and party finance corruption have shed light on the influence of unelected and illicit groups over the government. Serious allegations link drug trafficking to political elites. In 2021 and 2022, the US government sanctioned several former and current Guatemalan government officials, including Attorney General Porras and at least 10 judges and prosecutors, for corruption-related offenses. ",0,"Public information offices frequently fail to publish data about public expenditures as required. The Law on Access to Information is poorly enforced; nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) continue to file grievances over this lack of enforcement and, together with the Human Rights Ombudsperson’s Office (PDH), work to encourage the government to adhere to the law’s provisions. Contracting and budgeting processes are opaque and racked with corruption, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the easing of procurement requirements. In May 2022, the police suspended the publication of official data documenting homicides in the country, claiming that the information was confidential.",1
guinea,An unelected junta-led government has ruled the country since the military coup of September 2021.,0,"The country’s underfunded and understaffed National Anti-Corruption Agency was further undermined by instability that accompanied the coup. Junta leader and transition president Doumbouya announced the creation of a special anticorruption court (CRIEF) in December 2021. At the close of 2022, it was still difficult to judge the court’s effectiveness or ascertain the true motives behind its formation. It has summoned the former prime minister and several former ministers of the Condé era, and placed them under arrest for embezzlement, but has refused to examine corrupt activities within the armed forces and the mining sector. In October, the court ordered the arrest of Cellou Baldé, a supporter of the junta and leader of the Union of Democratic Forces.",1,"Government operations are generally opaque although the Condé administration had made some progress regarding budget transparency. A 2010 access to information law was never implemented, and the National Assembly voted in favor of a new version in 2020. In July 2022, the CNT debated a three-year budget proposal (2023–25) from the junta-led government. There has otherwise been very little effort by the interim government to facilitate or permit transparent debate about the budget.",1
guinea-bissau,"Governance has been impaired by the political crisis that began in 2015, and election delays have undermined the democratic legitimacy of incumbent officials. The original term of the parliament that was replaced by the March 2019 elections had expired nearly a year earlier. The full legislature has convened only sporadically in recent years.In early 2020, a constitutional crisis emerged when Embaló organized his inauguration unconstitutionally. The PAIGC, which had a slim parliamentary majority but lost the presidential election, ignored Embaló’s inauguration and appointed an interim president, Cipriano Cassamá. However, Cassamá resigned after one day in office, saying he feared for his safety. Embaló was eventually recognized by the parliament.",1,"Corruption is pervasive, including among senior government figures. Both military and civilian officials have been accused of involvement in the illegal drug trade. Critics of past corruption investigations targeting former high-ranking officials have argued that they were politically motivated.",1,"There are no effective legal provisions to facilitate public access to government information, and government officials do not disclose their personal financial information as required by law. The political impasse and related parliamentary dysfunction have further obstructed oversight of government spending in recent years. The lack of transparency contributes to chronic budget shortfalls, frequent delays in public-sector wages, and doubts about the management of foreign assistance.",0

In May 2022, President Ali met officially with opposition leader Aubrey Norton of the APNU-AFC for the first time, to discuss several long-vacant judicial and official appointments.",4,"In recent years, successive governments have introduced safeguards against corruption, notably by strengthening money-laundering controls and empowering a new agency to audit state-owned companies. However, graft remains widespread, and the exploitation of offshore oil and natural gas reserves is adding urgency to the need for effective anticorruption reforms.In July, Transparency Institute Guyana Inc. (TIGI) called on the government to officially investigate allegations of corruption concerning Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo that surfaced in a report by US-based Vice News.",2,"Laws designed to ensure government transparency are inconsistently upheld. A 2013 Access to Information Act allows the government to refuse requests with little or no justification.In May 2022, a board was appointed to the government integrity commission tasked with reviewing officials’ asset disclosures after its posts had remained vacant for over a year.Also in May 2022, the government released its third report for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, covering fiscal year 2019.Critics have suggested that the government’s initial set of oil contracts, negotiated privately with individual companies, are unfavorable to Guyana. A Natural Resource Fund (NRF) bill was passed in December 2021, restructuring systems put in place in 2019 to manage oil revenue. The bill establishes an oversight committee independent from the Ministry of Finance to boost transparency. It also requires that all reports of petroleum revenues be published in the Official Gazette within three months, with failure to do so punishable by stiff fines and lengthy prison terms. Critics have nevertheless suggested that the process for appointments to the NRF board and openings for Ministry of Finance influence over the fund could dent its independence.",2
haiti,"Few national leaders who held office in 2022 were freely elected or appointed according to the constitution. Henry was selected by Moïse to become prime minister in 2021, but that appointment was not approved by Parliament, which was dissolved in 2020 as most of its members lost their electoral mandates. Before his assassination, Moïse attempted to rule by decree; the legitimacy of his actions was questioned, since only members of Parliament have the constitutional authority to pass laws. Henry has ruled by decree after Moïse’s murder. Corruption, instability, and security threats hinder the government’s ability to carry out its own policies and provide basic services. In September, the G9 an Fanmi e Alye (Family and Allies) alliance of gangs blockaded the country’s main fuel terminal after the Henry government announced a reduction in fuel subsidies. In October, Henry called for other countries to send troops into the country. While some governments publicly considered Henry’s request and UN officials called on member states to provide assistance, no such force was deployed by year’s end. The government reclaimed control of the terminal in November, after reportedly negotiating with the gang.",1,"Corruption is widespread in Haiti, as are allegations of impunity for government officials. The country’s anticorruption framework, meanwhile, has been weakened in recent years. A 2017 law reduced the independence and powers of the Central Financial Intelligence Unit (UCREF), which investigated money-laundering cases. Also in 2017, Moïse replaced the heads of the Anticorruption Unit (ULCC) and the UCREF with political allies and former members of the Michel Martelly administration. Under a 2020 decree, procurement-related opinions issued by the Superior Court of Audits and Administrative Disputes (CSCCA) were made advisory and nonbinding; earlier that year, that court released a report on official corruption involving a development-loan program operated by Venezuela.In a report released in August 2022, the ULCC warned that corruption remained widespread in national and local government bodies.",1,"Haitians’ general distrust of the government stems in large part from the absence of transparency and accountability measures that are needed to reduce corruption. There are no access-to-information laws, and it is reportedly very difficult to obtain government documents and data in practice. All government officials must file financial disclosure forms within 90 days of taking office and within 90 days of leaving office, though these requirements are not well enforced and the reports are not made public. A 2020 presidential decree that created the National Intelligence Agency (ANI) granted it total secrecy and the ability to conduct surveillance on individuals and businesses at any time, even if there is no relevant ongoing investigation.In 2021, Henry dismissed the justice minister and a chief prosecutor after investigators under their supervision uncovered evidence that appeared to link Henry to a top suspect in the Moïse assassination, prompting accusations that he was obstructing justice. The investigation remained stalled at year’s end.",1
honduras,"Power was consolidated in the executive branch under measures adopted since 2014. The military, which has traditionally maintained substantial autonomy from civilian oversight, has played an increasing role in both internal security and programs unrelated to security.There are growing concerns over the influence that President Castro’s husband, former president José Manuel Zelaya Rosales (2006–09), and other members of the Zelaya family have over political affairs.",2,"Corruption was rampant under the PN. The Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, established in 2016, was shut down in 2020 despite public support for that body.President Castro’s immediate predecessor, Juan Orlando Hernández, was directly implicated in corruption in 2019 when US prosecutors identified him and former president Porfirio Lobo as coconspirators in a drug-smuggling operation run by Hernández’s brother. Former president Hernández was arrested by police in Honduras in February 2022—with the Castro administration accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels—and was extradited to face drug-trafficking and arms charges in the United States in April.President Castro has a mixed anticorruption record. In February 2022, the National Congress passed a law providing amnesty to officials serving during the Zelaya administration, including those targeted or prosecuted for opposing the 2009 coup d’état against Zelaya. Critics objected to the law’s breadth, saying it would pardon those engaged in corruption. Ángel Edmundo Orellana Mercado, who served as transparency minister in 2022, called the law an “impunity pact.” In July, the US State Department released a list of corrupt and undemocratic actors in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador; two Libre congresspeople and an advisor to President Castro were included. Since the Castro administration took office, Libre activists have also targeted public-sector employees and demanded employment based on their party affiliation.However, the Castro administration facilitated the extradition of former president Hernández. In December, the government signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations to create a UN-backed International Mission against Impunity in Honduras.",1,"Government operations are generally opaque. Journalists and interest groups have difficulty obtaining information from the government. A secrecy law passed in 2014 allowed authorities to withhold information on security and national defense for up to 25 years. Civil society representatives criticized the 2020 creation of a Ministry of Transparency as an effort to undermine the efficacy of existing transparency mechanisms.The Castro administration has taken some steps to foster greater openness and transparency. The Hernández-era secrecy law, which was perceived as a vehicle for official corruption, was repealed in March 2022. In April, legislators repealed a law that created Areas of Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs), which were meant to attract investment but prompted fears that they would facilitate corrupt activities. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that some ZEDEs, which allowed private firms operating there considerable autonomy, were still active as of October. In July, legislators passed a law to improve transparency in the nomination of Supreme Court justices, although it was criticized for favoring the interests of political parties, particularly Libre.",2
hungary,"The governing coalition is effectively able to draft and implement laws and policies at will. Fidesz continues to dominate governance through a parliamentary supermajority acquired by means of elections that were not fully competitive. Prime Minister Orbán, the party’s leader, exerts considerable influence over the legislature. The ability of the opposition to check government activities remains limited.Lawmakers have had their behavior in the National Assembly restricted in several ways. The speaker of the National Assembly has disciplined and fined opposition lawmakers for occupying the lectern and bringing signs onto the floor.In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government declared a “state of danger” and passed the widely denounced Authorization Act, conferring sweeping emergency powers to the executive, which it has used without accountability to restrict civil liberties unrelated to public health or safety. This COVID-19 emergency legal regime enabled the government to rule by decree and was prolonged several times until November 2022, when the government declared another state of danger related to the Russia-Ukraine war. Before this, in May, the government had amended the law defining the necessary conditions for a state of danger to include “armed conflict, war, or humanitarian catastrophe” in a neighboring country.",2,"Corruption remains a problem in Hungary, and instances of high-level government corruption have not been properly investigated. Fidesz has established control over auditing and investigative bodies, including the ÁSZ. Prosecutors have also been reluctant to investigate long-standing allegations of the misuse of public development funds disbursed by the European Union (EU), despite the severity of the problem. In December 2022, the European Commission withdrew €22 billion under the EU Cohesion Fund from Hungary in response to repeated violations of EU law, the Hungarian courts’ lack of judicial independence, corruption allegations regarding the use of EU funds, and more.Throughout 2022, the government adopted a series of anticorruption measures for the proper handling of EU funds. In November, a new Integrity Authority was established, though with limited power to conduct investigations and suspend ongoing public procurement processes. According to Hungarian and international watchdog organizations, the measures were broadly insufficient.",2,"Hungary’s Freedom of Information Act contains numerous exemptions, permits agencies to charge fees for the release of information, and is inconsistently enforced. In many cases, information is only made available because of litigation. In November 2020, the parliament narrowed the legal definition of what constitutes public funds, hampering oversight of large amounts of public money.Major legislation is frequently rushed through the parliament, leaving citizens and interest groups little time to provide feedback or criticism. Important proposals are hidden in long omnibus bills, and the government tends to submit substantial bills overnight. In October 2022, the government amended public consultation rules to strengthen public participation in lawmaking, which Hungarian NGOs denounced the law as superficial. Journalists have been curtailed from performing their duties while covering parliamentary events; the speaker prohibited audio and video recording in corridors surrounding the plenary chamber, entrances, and on-site cafeterias in October 2019.When emergency laws were introduced in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government extended the deadline for fulfilling freedom of information requests until November 2022.

However, most requesters do not receive the information sought, including those seeking information about core government policies, and noncompliant officials generally go unpunished. Dozens of right-to-information users and activists have been murdered since the RTI Act’s introduction, and hundreds have been assaulted or harassed.

For example, officials are known to promote COVID-19-related disinformation; in January 2021, the supreme leader banned the use of vaccines produced in the United States and Britain, calling them “completely untrustworthy.” Nevertheless, the country accepted US- and British-developed vaccines that were manufactured in other countries.In response to the protests triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022, authorities tightly restricted access to related information, including the number, status, and treatment of arrested demonstrators and other political prisoners.",0

The Netanyahu government formed in 2022 enjoys a clear majority and internal homogeneity and is generally expected to remain stable.",4,"Corruption scandals are common in all levels of government, and high-level corruption investigations are relatively frequent, with senior officials implicated in several scandals and criminal cases in recent years. In 2019, then prime minister Netanyahu was indicted on charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust for allegedly accepting expensive gifts, his apparent attempt to collude with the owner of the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth to secure positive coverage, and the granting of regulatory favors to telecommunications operator and media conglomerate Bezeq in return for positive coverage. Netanyahu denied the charges against him and accused law enforcement bodies of perpetrating “an attempted coup,” a sentiment amplified by right-wing media outlets. Netanyahu refused to step down as prime minister after the indictment and held office through the first half of 2021, after which he became leader of the opposition. Netanyahu was reelected as prime minister following the November 2022 elections and is expected to pursue legislative approval of an immunity bill that would shield him and other lawmakers from prosecution while in office. Netanyahu’s trial has been ongoing since April 2021. Netanyahu’s supporters, including his son Yair Netanyahu, have been accused of attempting to intimidate prosecution witnesses.Netanyahu and his supporters have also accused the Israeli police, the Ministry of Justice, and the attorney general’s office of conspiring to “silence” Netanyahu and to carry out a coup against his right-wing government. Sources within Israeli law enforcement institutions told reporters during 2021 and 2022 that Israeli police chief Kobi Shabtai has discouraged investigations into corruption and cut the resources available for such complex investigations, due to fears of government backlash.",2,"Israel’s laws, political practices, civil society groups, and independent media generally ensure a substantial level of governmental transparency, though recent corruption cases have illustrated persistent shortcomings.

The changes extended the presidential term from five to seven years, but limited presidential tenure to one term of office. It also introduced a mixed electoral system, reduced the members of the Majilis to 98, and extended parliamentary powers. Critics argued the reforms were a way for Toqaev to legitimize his rule. The president retained the powers to appoint the prime minister, the prosecutor general, the security chief, local Akims (governors), and other senior officials in government.",0,"Corruption is widespread at all levels of government. Corruption cases are often prosecuted at the local and regional levels, but charges against high-ranking political and business elites are rare, typically emerging only after an individual has fallen out of favor with the leadership.

kenya,"The ability of elected officials to set and implement policy is undermined by corruption and dysfunction. Although the 2010 constitution reduced the powers of the executive branch and improved the oversight role of Parliament, corruption limits the independence of the legislative branch, and in practice, Parliament is generally subordinate to the president. In 2021, Kenyatta, Odinga, and leaders of Kenyatta’s Jubilee Coalition used threats and intimidation to secure support among party members, local officials, and judges for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), a bill to alter government structures ahead of the 2022 election, prior to the bill’s defeat in the courts in March 2022.",2,"Corruption continues to plague national and county governments in Kenya, and state institutions tasked with combating corruption have been ineffective. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) lacks prosecutorial power and has been largely unsuccessful in pursuing corruption cases. The EACC’s weakness is compounded by shortcomings at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and within the judiciary. Following the 2018 appointment of Noordin Haji as Director of Public Prosecutions, the ODPP stepped up anticorruption investigations, arresting and charging a number of high-profile officials. However, the August 2022 election of Rigathi Gachagua as Ruto’s deputy president has been widely criticized as emblematic of continued impunity for those accused of corruption. In 2021, Gachagua was charged with six counts relating to corruption; he was ordered to repay $1.7 million in July 2022, less than two weeks before the election.

The mandates of Kosovo’s main anticorruption bodies overlap, and they have difficulty coordinating their efforts. Since independence authorities have shown little commitment to prosecuting high-level corruption, and when top officials are prosecuted, convictions are rare. In 2022, the Kurti government pursued new reforms aimed at combatting corruption and organized crime. Among other efforts, the administration produced a draft law on confiscation of assets gained through corruption, and advanced reforms to judicial vetting processes.",1,"The Kurti government made a number of key decisions throughout the year—including some related to the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue process—with limited transparency and without consulting the Assembly, prompting criticism from the opposition and civil society groups. Government institutions frequently deny legal requests for public information with little or no justification. Courts have been very slow to respond to complaints from those denied information due to persistent backlogs in the judicial system.",2
kuwait,"While elected members of parliament can initiate legislation, policymaking authority is concentrated in the hands of the hereditary emir and his appointed government.

He can also veto legislation and issue executive decrees when the assembly is not in session.Cabinet ministers, including members of the ruling family, are subject to questioning by the parliament, often leading to tension between the two branches of government. In February 2022, the interior and defense ministers resigned in protest, accusing lawmakers of abusing their oversight powers. The impending vote of no confidence that triggered the cabinet’s resignation in April 2022 was driven in part by the prime minister’s repeated refusal to submit to questioning over the previous year, though he did appear in late March.Interactions between the executive and legislature are affected by succession-related rivalries within the ruling family. Powerful members of the family are able to put pressure on rivals in ministerial roles by cultivating parliamentary allies who can question them and scrutinize their performance.",1,"Corruption is pervasive.

kyrgyzstan,"A new constitution, ratified in May 2021, significantly altered the structure of the government and resolved existing constitutional ambiguities regarding the division of power among the president, the prime minister, and the parliament, which had contributed to the instability of governments in recent years. The 2021 constitution eliminated the office of the prime minister and reduced the powers of the legislature, reintroducing a superpresidential system of government. After former president Jeenbekov resigned amid protests in October 2020, neither his presidential successors nor their concurrently serving prime ministers were freely selected. A snap presidential election held in January 2021 elected Japarov to the presidency; however, the election was neither free nor fair, featuring significant procedural irregularities and a record low voter turnout. Though the results of the October 2020 parliamentary elections were annulled later that same month, the parliament continued to operate until new elections were held in November 2021—well beyond the expiration of its democratic mandate.",0,"Corruption is pervasive in politics and government. Political elites use government resources to reward clients—including organized crime figures—and punish opponents. An anticorruption office within the GKNB was formed in 2012, but has primarily been used by incumbent presidents to target their political enemies in the parliament and municipal governments. Throughout 2022, a wide range of former officials, business leaders, and organized crime leaders were detained repeatedly on corruption charges. Critics have described this “catch-and-release” pattern of arrests as both a political tool and a way for the government to generate revenue.",0,"Kyrgyzstani access-to-information laws are considered relatively strong, but implementation is poor in practice. Similarly, although public officials are obliged to disclose information on their personal finances, powerful figures are rarely held accountable for noncompliance or investigated for unexplained wealth. Oversight of public contracts is inadequate; corruption scandals in recent years have often centered on procurement deals or sales of state assets.Kyrgyzstani officials were not transparent in disclosing COVID-19 infections or deaths; in January 2021, a government inquiry found that official data had been manipulated and pandemic-related deaths had been significantly underreported.Government decisions were made and key posts were claimed in an opaque fashion in the aftermath of the annulled October 2020 elections. Japarov notably claimed the powers of the presidency immediately after Jeenbekov’s resignation but before the parliament appointed him to the role. Meanwhile, the parliament eschewed a mandatory public comment period when deciding to amend the electoral code that month.The government’s pronounced lack of transparency around a proposed agreement that would demarcate Kyrgyzstan’s border with Uzbekistan—segments of which have remained undefined since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991—led to protests in October 2022.

The State Audit Organization, which gained the power to conduct financial and budget investigations during his premiership, uncovered instances of misappropriated state funds and unreported expenditures. Yet there have been persistent rumors that the country’s large-scale borrowing from China in recent years was inflated in part by corruption in the associated infrastructure projects.Phankham, Thongloun’s successor as prime minister, also vowed to combat official corruption, but this goal appeared to be overshadowed during 2022 by the need to manage the broader economic crisis.",1,"There is no law guaranteeing access to official information in Laos.

State expenditures remain irregular, with few mechanisms for effective oversight. Although civil society groups have some ability to influence pending policies or legislation, and may along with the media discuss proposals that have been made public, their influence is often contingent on participation in opaque processes. The National Assembly approved an access to information law in 2017, but it is not fully implemented, and government documents remain difficult to obtain in practice.In the aftermath of a devastating 2020 explosion in the port of Beirut, caused by dangerous chemicals that had been left for years in a warehouse, the state responded in opaque and arbitrary ways, withholding information and employing special emergency powers intermittently or selectively. Several former cabinet ministers, including a former prime minister, were initially charged with criminal negligence in the case, but the investigation stalled in the face of obstruction by leading political figures, and during 2022 it remained bogged down by legal challenges that could not be resolved due to vacancies on the Court of Cassation.Since 2019, the country has been suffering through one of the worst economic crises in world history, with a precipitous currency collapse underscoring concerns about transparency at the central bank and accountability for years of mismanagement that led to the crisis.

That same month, Majoro survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence.In August, then-Prime Minister Majoro declared a state of emergency to enable Parliament to reconvene and pass critical electoral and constitutional reforms meant to governance; for example, making it more difficult for lawmakers to remove the prime minister in a no-confidence vote or switch parties.

BIANCO identified 79 lawmakers who accepted bribes to adopt 2018 electoral reforms; prosecutors had not pursued cases against them by the end of 2022. In 2019, BIANCO submitted a report to the High Court of Justice (HCJ) implicating three former ministers in acts of corruption; the court has not yet reviewed the allegations. Nevertheless, in October 2021, former prime minister Jean Ravelonarivo was convicted of corruption, fined 6 billion ariary ($1.5 million), and sentenced to five years in prison. Ravelonarivo did not attend his trial and allegedly fled to Switzerland days before the court ruled on his case.",2,"The constitution provides for the right to information, but no law defines a formal procedure for requesting government information. However, ministers and officials often hold press briefings, and laws, decrees, and high court decisions are posted on the internet.There is little oversight of procurement processes. Asset declarations are required for most government officials, and while many complied with these laws, there are few practical consequences for those who refuse.",2
malawi,"Executive and legislative representatives typically determine the policies of government without hindrance. However, patronage and clientelism are common, and wealthy business leaders often influence policymaking.",3,"Corruption is a significant challenge in Malawi, with senior government officials being implicated in corruption in recent years. The delivery of government services is affected, with lower-level officials being pressured into to tolerating the corrupt behavior of their superiors.Civil society leaders have accused the ACB of being ineffective and politically compromised in the past. In July 2022, the ACB gained the ability to prosecute corruption cases without seeking consent from the director of public prosecutions. In August, it arrested one of its former chiefs, Reyneck Matemba, for allegedly accepting a bribe.In June 2022, President Chakwera stripped Vice President Saulos Chilima’s powers after the ACB accused Chilima of corruption. In November, the ACB arrested Chilima for allegedly receiving funds from Zuneth Sattar, a Malawi-born businessman active in the United Kingdom, in return for awarding government contracts to firms connected to Sattar. Chilima remained in office at year’s end.In December 2022, ACB chief Martha Chizuma was arrested over comments recorded in January; in those comments, Chizuma expressed her concern that the ACB’s investigation into the Sattar affair was being impeded. Chizuma had been criticized for breaching an oath to secrecy, though observers tied her arrest to the ACB’s investigation of Vice President Chilima.",2,The government lacks budgetary transparency and does not make year-end budget audit reports public. President Chakwera regularly appears before lawmakers to answer their questions. Government ministers occasionally appear before the media to address major issues and answer journalists’ questions.High-level officials are legally required to declare their assets and other financial interests while in public service.,3
malaysia,"While elected officials determine and implement government policy, an unfair electoral framework has historically weakened their legitimacy. Decision-making power has typically been concentrated in the hands of the prime minister and his close advisers.Elected lawmakers were unable to fulfill their functions for much of 2021, as Prime Minister Muhyiddin had imposed a COVID-19-related state of emergency in January that allowed him to rule by decree. Parliament and state legislatures were suspended, as were elections, and opposition lawmakers accused Muhyiddin of using the emergency declaration to avoid a no-confidence vote. Parliament was reconvened that July, while the state of emergency expired at the beginning of August. There was no repetition of the tactic during 2022, and Parliament was not dissolved until October, ahead of the general elections. ",2,"The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission is responsible for fighting corruption. While successful prosecutions have been on the rise in recent years, corruption in government and state-owned enterprises is still considered endemic.In August 2022, former BN prime minister Najib Razak was sent to prison after the Federal Court upheld his 12-year sentence for offenses linked to the 1MDB corruption and fraud scandal. He had originally been arrested in 2018 and convicted in 2020. Rosmah Mansor, Najib’s wife, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in September 2022 for soliciting and receiving bribes; she filed an appeal and remained free at year’s end. Also in September, the High Court acquitted UMNO president and former deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi of some corruption charges, though others were still pending.

The parliament was able to operate without similar obstructions after President Solih’s 2018 inauguration and the 2019 parliamentary elections.",2,"Corruption remains endemic at all levels of government. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been only moderately effective, often launching investigations and taking other actions in response to public complaints, but rarely holding powerful figures to account for abuses. Whistleblowers and journalists reporting on corruption have been jailed or forced into exile over their activities.The Solih government has taken steps to combat corruption by launching a whistleblower web portal, creating legal protections for whistleblowers, and pursuing corruption cases against high-level officials from the Yameen administration. Yameen himself was convicted of money laundering in 2019, though in November 2021 the Supreme Court overturned his conviction. In 2022, in a separate case, he was once again convicted of money laundering and accepting a bribe and sentenced to 11 years in prison.In December 2021, three members of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) resigned following a decision by the Parliament’s Committee on Independent Institutions to dismiss them; the committee’s decision was presaged by an audit concluding that the members had failed to formulate a plan to address backlogged corruption cases. The commission was reconstituted with new members in March 2022.",1,"State contracts for infrastructure and other projects have often been awarded through unclear processes widely suspected to involve bribery and kickbacks. The Solih administration has not immediately revised changes to public finance rules by the previous government that introduced opacity.While the constitution requires the president, cabinet ministers, and members of parliament to submit annual asset declarations, these are not required to be made public and relevant agencies have resisted disclosing compliance with this rule. In 2019, Solih and his cabinet publicly disclosed their personal finances, but Transparency International raised concerns about the accuracy and consistency of these disclosures. The Right to Information Act has been increasingly effective in forcing government institutions to make information and processes more transparent.

mali,"President Keïta was elected in a generally credible poll in 2018, and the National Assembly that took office in 2013 was also freely elected. That parliament remained in place beyond the end of its mandate, however, with elections eventually held in March and April 2020. The August 2020 coup d’état replaced an elected national government with a military regime; a second coup in May 2021 reinforced the military’s hold on power, causing renewed uncertainty about the reintroduction of civilian rule. A civilian, Choguel Maïga, was appointed as prime minister in June 2021, but several key government positions were filled by military leaders. Prime Minister Maïga was temporarily replaced by Colonel Abdoulaye Maïga in August 2022 after suffering a stroke; the civilian prime minister was reinstated in December. A transition deadline of March 2024 was formalized in June 2022 as part of an agreement reached by ECOWAS and Malian authorities. The agreement was followed by the lifting of the sanctions ECOWAS had placed on Mali that January in response to delays in the planned transition to civilian government. Though there has been some consultation with political parties and civil society, the transition process has also been criticized as unilateral and undemocratic by some stakeholders.In June 2022, Goïta announced that the government had created a commission to draft a new constitution, which would be put to a referendum in 2023. A preliminary draft constitution was delivered to Goïta in October, but was not made public; a final draft had not been completed before year’s end. Opposition figures criticized the proposed constitution on a number of grounds, expressing concern that it would concentrate power in the hands of the president and dismay that it had not been drafted by a democratic, civilian government.The volatile security situation in northern and central Mali has limited the effective territorial reach of government authority. There have been credible reports in recent years, including 2022, that the Wagner Group—a Russian government–linked private military group—was operating in Mali. Malian authorities have confirmed the presence of Russian military advisers in Mali, but have denied that Wagner mercenaries are operating in the country.",0,"Corruption remains a problem in government, notably in public procurement. Bribery and embezzlement of public funds is common, and impunity for corrupt officials is the norm. The Office of the Auditor General is an independent agency responsible for analyzing public spending, but despite its identification of sizable cases of embezzlement, very few prosecutions have taken place. After the 2020 coup d’état, the CNSP launched a crackdown on apparent abuses by government officials but took little action to fight corruption within the military. In July 2022, arrest warrants were issued for a number of former government officials, including former prime minister Cissé, purportedly for the crime of forgery, among other things. However, some have expressed concern that the warrants represent a possible attempt to prevent the officials from contesting the 2024 presidential election.In 2021, former prime minister Soumeylou Boubèye Maïga and former finance minister Bouaré Fily Sissoko were arrested on fraud charges in connection with the 2014 purchase of a presidential plane and $40 million in military equipment contracts. Maïga remained in custody until his death in March 2022.",1,"Government operations remain generally opaque, and Mali does not have a comprehensive legal framework for freedom of information. While numerous laws provide for public access to some official documents and information, they are replete with extensive and vague exceptions. Journalists have faced obstacles when attempting to obtain information, particularly about military expenditures. Opposition figures have criticized the constitution drafting process undertaken in 2022, and some have called for a more democratic drafting process. The draft constitution was not made public when it was submitted to military leadership in October.",1

Constitutional reforms adopted in 2020 were designed to reinforce the independence of the president and the judiciary, but the CoE has continued to call for stronger institutional checks on the government.",4,"Anticorruption efforts are weak, and senior government officials and businesspeople have been linked to corruption and influence peddling in recent years. The Permanent Commission against Corruption (PCAC), created in 1988, lacks independent prosecutorial authority. The 2020 constitutional reforms empowered it to send its findings to the attorney general for further action. Also under the reforms, legislators—rather than the prime minister—select the PCAC chairperson. Nevertheless, the commission has limited resources and has not shown tangible results.In January 2022, police searched the residence of former prime minister Joseph Muscat as part of a corruption investigation involving a private company’s 2018 deal to operate three state-owned hospitals. Separately during 2022, Yorgen Fenech, a stakeholder in energy firm Electrogas Malta, was awaiting trial for allegedly orchestrating the 2017 murder of Caruana Galizia. The journalist had accused the company of involvement in corruption before her death.GRECO and its Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti–Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism reported in 2021 that Malta was making progress in fighting money laundering, and in June 2022 the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental money laundering watchdog, removed Malta from its “grey list” of countries that are subject to special monitoring.",2,"Malta has a Freedom of Information Act and asset disclosure rules for public officials. However, journalists’ information requests are rarely answered. The Shift, an online news outlet, remained locked in a legal battle with the government during 2022 over a series of information requests dating to 2020, despite favorable rulings from the country’s data protection commissioner.Government contracts are often withheld from the public. In 2021, the National Audit Office criticized an opaque 2015 agreement allowing a private company to operate three public hospitals, which were transferred to a second contractor in 2018 after the first firm collapsed. The auditor noted a lack of documentation, the initial contractor’s failure to meet its obligations, and concerns surrounding the company’s financial condition, among other issues.",3

High-ranking public officials, however, are rarely prosecuted for corruption. Corruption is most prevalent in the allocation of foreign aid, government procurement, and transfers. The number of fraud cases prosecuted by the auditor general increased in both 2019 and 2020, a possible sign of added effectiveness due to new funding from the World Bank. In 2020, a three-year review of the government’s passport program found numerous internal control and compliance problems. Over 500 passports had been issued to non-Indigenous Marshallese who did not have evidence of legal citizenship. In several instances, passport applications were approved without the required documentation at the instruction of high-ranking officials.According to an indictment issued in the United States in September 2022, two naturalized Marshallese citizens allegedly paid thousands of dollars in bribes to at least five elected officials in the RMI between 2016 and 2020 in return for their support for the creation of a special foreign investment zone on Rongelap Atoll. A resolution endorsing the concept was passed by the Nitijela in March 2020 with the support of the bribed officials, though no further action had been taken as of year-end 2022.

Transparency Mauritius, an organization associated with Transparency International, condemned Jugnauth for refusing to allow an independent investigation into allegations against him. This fueled concerns in civil society about a slide towards autocracy while renewing accusations of corruption.

mexico,"Organized crime and related violence have limited the effective governing authority of elected officials in some areas of the country, as well as of the federal government. Members of organized crime groups have persisted in their attempts to infiltrate local governments in order to plunder municipal coffers and ensure their own impunity, a practice that has influenced electoral dynamics. The notorious mass disappearance of 43 students in 2014 was linked to a deeply corrupt local government collaborating with a drug gang, as well as corrupt or complicit members of various state security forces. In the most violent regions, the provision of public services has become more difficult, as public sector employees face extortion and pressure to divert public funds.",2,"Official corruption remains a serious problem. Despite Mexico’s relatively comprehensive anticorruption framework, implementation of existing mechanisms is lacking in practice and high levels of impunity persist. The billions of dollars in illegal drug money that enter the country each year from the United States profoundly affect politics, as does rampant public-contract fraud and other forms of siphoning off state funds. Attempts to prosecute officials for alleged involvement in corrupt or criminal activity have often failed due to the weakness of police and judicial capacity.The López Obrador administration has made the pursuit of corruption a mantra, and a series of prominent figures from the Peña Nieto administration have been indicted or arrested on graft charges.

The military, assigned ever-expanding roles under López Obrador, is one of the least transparent state institutions. A 2021 decree shielding public infrastructure projects from transparency and other administrative requirements was vocally denounced by transparency advocates. President López Obrador has repeatedly suggested shuttering the INAI in recent years, prompting criticism by transparency advocates.",2

myanmar,"In February 2021, the military prevented newly elected parliamentary representatives from taking office, utilizing a provision in the 2008 constitution that allows the military to dissolve the civilian government and rule directly if the president declares a state of emergency. The state of emergency was renewed in August 2022 for a further six months. The junta’s takeover of the state apparatus has led to a breakdown in governance, including education, healthcare, local administration, and tax collection. Effective control over territory also remained elusive, and slipped further out of the military’s grasp in 2022. A detailed briefing paper produced in September 2022 by the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, an independent group of international experts supporting human rights in Myanmar in response to the 2021 coup, estimated that the junta exercised full stable control in only 22 percent of townships in the country. In April 2021, the CRPH established the NUG, a resistance government largely made up of ousted NLD politicians. Since then, the NUG has operated as an alternate power structure with influence or effective control over a growing swathe of the country, though the Special Advisory Council estimated they controlled approximately 2 percent of townships. Shortly after the NUG was formed, Myanmar’s military leadership classified the NUG, its armed People’s Defense Forces (PDFs), and the CRPH as terrorist organizations, which could result in prosecution and detention for anyone who communicates with the groups’ members. In partnership with ethnic organizations and newer local-level structures, it engaged in a broader range of service delivery and revenue collection in 2022, though financial and logistical limitations remain.",0,"Despite government initiatives aimed at curbing official corruption, it remains rampant at both the national and local levels. An Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), established in 2014, had brought several cases against high-ranking officials. Following the 2021 coup, the military brought multiple illegitimate corruption charges against several high profile leaders, including former president Win Myint. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was arrested by the military during the coup, was convicted on a range of charges, including corruption, in multiple trials in 2022. She was sentenced to a total of 33 years imprisonment by December. The evidence presented against Suu Kyi has been spurious, and she has denied the charges and asked her lawyers to appeal her convictions.Privatization of state-owned companies and other economic reforms in recent years have allegedly benefited family members and associates of military and government officials. After the February 2021 coup, the children of high-ranking military leaders allegedly attempted to use their connections to secure lucrative supply contracts and other kickbacks.",1,"After the Tatmadaw took power in 2021, the already limited transparency mechanisms of the previous government were dismantled; oversight by civil society groups and the media has been completely suppressed under military rule.The military also owns an extensive network of “crony companies” whose revenues enable it to avoid accountability and public oversight and engage in human rights violations with impunity, according to a United Nations report released in 2019. ",0
namibia,"The democratically elected government freely determines policies. However, 2014 reforms increased executive power, including by adding parliamentarians who are appointed by the president and by limiting the National Council’s power to review certain bills.

Bills including the Combating of Domestic Violence Amendment Act and Access to Information (ATI) law, which parliament finally passed in September and October 2022, respectively, have sometimes faced lengthy finalization processes. During the September session, critics highlighted the absenteeism of members of parliament.The government suspended parliamentary sessions during parts of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2022, the ACC reported that of the 730 cases it referred for prosecution since its inception there have been 184 convictions, and 242 cases are still active and before the courts. In 2021, the National Assembly approved the president’s extension of the ACC head, Paulus Noa, for another five years, a decision heavily criticized by those who believed that his 15-year tenure had been largely ineffective. Critics continue to question the appointment process, which lacks transparency, and Noa’s efficiency.

In September 2021, the Nauruan government signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Australia to indefinitely maintain operations of the immigration detention center on the island. The new Australian government elected in 2022 pledged to keep the center open; revenue generated by the center (AUD $135 million, or US$93 million) constituted more than half of Nauru’s anticipated revenue in its 2022–23 budget.In February 2021, Nauru announced its intentions to leave the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), which maintained significant influence over government policy and processes, after tensions grew over the appointment of a new general secretary.

The quality of the government archival system was questioned, and an October report from the Information and Heritage Inspectorate revealed that only a limited number of the prime minister’s online chat messages were archived properly.A scandal centered on the Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst), which had improperly punished thousands of families from 2012 to 2019 for allegedly defrauding a system of child-care allowances, persisted in 2022 amid limited progress on reparations, revelations about the discriminatory basis of the tax service’s practices, and the separation of over 2,000 children from families that had been affected by the unjust enforcement measures. In July, an appellate court confirmed that the Belastingdienst itself could not be prosecuted for discrimination and extortion, but criminal complaints filed against specific tax officers, for discrimination and extortion as well as for perjury they may have committed during a 2020 parliamentary investigation into the scandal, were still pending at year’s end.The coalition agreement undergirding Rutte’s new government in 2022 included plans to improve government transparency and accountability, in part by making state inspectorates more independent.

In one case in October 2022, three people were convicted of “obtaining by deception” for deliberately making political donations in a way that concealed the identity of the donor in 2017 and 2018. Among those convicted in the proceedings brought by New Zealand’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was Yikun Zhang, a New Zealand national who was born in China and is a former member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an organization with links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Following government pledges to further tighten campaign finance rules before the 2023 general election, Parliament passed the Electoral Amendment Bill in December 2022; among other things, the legislation includes provisions lowering the threshold at which political parties must publicly identify a donor from NZ$15,000 (US$9,342) to NZ$5,000 (US$3,114). Prior to the adoption of the bill in December, some opposition leaders argued that the SFO’s successful prosecutions indicated that existing laws were working, and that no further reforms were required.",4,"The government operates with a high level of transparency, and new legislation is openly discussed in Parliament and the media.

Investigations have revealed extensive corruption in several presidential administrations. Former president Ricardo Martinelli and multiple top officials were implicated in connection with the Odebrecht case, a corruption scandal centered on a Brazilian construction firm that had repercussions across much of Latin America. The Odebrecht bribery case is considered the most significant corruption case in Panama’s history, and initial hearing was held in September 2022 with 83 defendants. In the hearing, the prosecutor’s office sought to charge 48 people and one legal entity. The legal entity and 46 individuals faced charges of money laundering, and two individuals faced charges of both money laundering and corruption of public servants. Among the defendants are former presidents Ricardo Martinelli (2009–14), Juan Carlos Varela (2014–19), and other former senior officials. The trial is set to take place in August 2023. In May 2022, a US court convicted Martinelli’s two sons of conspiring to receive bribes from Odebrecht, allegedly for their father.The Cortizo administration’s anticorruption and transparency efforts have slowed since 2019, when the National Assembly rejected the president’s proposal of a constitutional reform package that would have allowed the attorney general to investigate CSJ judges and legislators suspected of wrongdoing.

Anticorruption protests and citizen transparency initiatives have forced the prosecution of officials from several parties under Abdo Benítez, who has taken a somewhat firmer line against corruption than his predecessors.The COVID-19 pandemic saw serious and credible allegations of corruption regarding the purchase of coronavirus-related supplies by the government, triggering the resignation of the health minister in 2021.In September 2022, a legislative commission report detailed a smuggling network run by members of Paraguay’s customs service and navy; earlier in the year, several officers and commanders had been removed from their posts over involvement with smuggling.In July 2022, the US State Department designated former president Cartes for involvement in “significant corruption” as well as links to “foreign terrorist organizations,” barring him from the United States. In August, the US likewise designated Vice President Hugo Velázquez and one of his close associates for involvement in “significant corruption.” However, no corresponding investigation into Cartes or Velázquez was announced in Paraguay. Velázquez resigned as vice president in August, days after the US action, but then withdrew the resignation. However, he did drop out of the presidential race that month. Cartes’s preferred presidential candidate, Santiago Peña, won the December 2022 presidential primary vote to lead the Colorado ticket for the 2023 presidential election. Should Peña win, it is likely to further quash the ability of the compromised judiciary to investigate Cartes, whose outsized influence over Paraguay’s institutions and political life is becoming entrenched.",2,"Government transparency is gradually improving, and the effective implementation of access to information laws has bolstered investigative journalism. Anticorruption demonstrations are becoming more common and have led to prosecutions. President Abdo Benítez has taken a somewhat firmer line against corruption, including against alleged malfeasance by Cartes, but has been politically sidelined as his wing of the Colorado Party lost the 2022 primary.",2
peru,"Elected leaders and representatives are the key agents in creating and implementing policy. However, businesses and special interest groups influence officials through bribes and other illicit payments. Several former presidents and longtime opposition leader Keiko Fujimori have all been accused of accepting illegal funds.Clashes between the executive and legislative branches remain common. During Castillo’s approximately 17-month-long presidency, the executive struggled to function amid ongoing interbranch clashes that threatened to escalate to a constitutional crisis. Castillo was unable to effectively implement policies or maintain a stable government during his short tenure. Castillo also faced repeated impeachment attempts and confidence votes by the legislature. Though Congress voted against impeaching the president in December 2021 and March 2022, a vote to impeach and remove Castillo passed “overwhelmingly” in December 2022 following his attempt to unlawfully dissolve Congress and seize power. Though some observers noted that earlier impeachment attempts against Castillo had relied on dubious interpretations of the constitution, the proceedings that removed Castillo from office in December were generally deemed legitimate. After removing Castillo, Congress appointed then vice president Dina Boluarte to the presidency in accordance with legal procedures.",2,"Government corruption remains a critical problem in Peru, though law enforcement authorities frequently investigate and prosecute corruption allegations. Recent years have seen scandals involving allegations of illicit deals between the Brazilian firm Odebrecht and a number of the country’s most senior political figures.Since taking office in July 2021, Castillo has been the subject of several corruption allegations. Though he has repeatedly denied the accusations, authorities had opened six corruption-related investigations into Castillo as of October 2022, alleging that the then president had engaged in influence peddling and collusion, among other crimes; investigations into Castillo remained ongoing at year’s end.Several of Castillo’s associates were also placed under investigation for corruption in 2021 and 2022, including former health minister Jorge Lopez for allegedly misappropriating public funds. Relatives of Castillo have also been implicated in corruption schemes, including his wife, Lilia Paredes, who is accused of participating in a high-level “corruption network” that fraudulently awarded public works contracts.While president, Castillo sought to undermine safeguards against corruption, including through the arbitrary removal of Peru’s attorney general, Daniel Soria, in February 2022. Soria was reinstated as attorney general in October following a ruling by a Lima court.",2,"Some government agencies have made progress on transparency, but much information related to defense and security policies remains classified under a 2012 law. Observers noted an overall decline in transparency during the Castillo administration.",2

The Office of the Ombudsman, tasked with investigating and filing complaints against government workers and officials, is poorly resourced. Currently headed by a Duterte appointee, the Ombudsman’s performance has received criticism for the significant decrease in the number of cases filed since 2018. During a Senate hearing on the office’s budget, the Ombudsman in September 2022 admitted that there is corruption even in his office.The Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC), established by the Duterte administration, was one of the first agencies abolished by Marcos, by executive order in July 2022.",1,"Government transparency remains limited despite some positive initiatives. The country’s first freedom of information directive was issued in 2016, but it mandates public disclosure only in the executive branch and allows major exemptions. Since 2021, the Ombudsman has restricted public access to elected and government officials’ statements of assets and liabilities, asserting they were being “weaponized.” The office has also announced it would no longer conduct “lifestyle checks” that investigate officials’ unexplained wealth.Like Duterte’s administration, in 2022 Marcos’s office requested tens of millions of dollars’ worth of “confidence and intelligence” funds, a budget category intended for surveillance and military intelligence-gathering operations. (The administration of their predecessor, the late Benigno Aquino III, has asked for dramatically less.) Due to the classified nature of such operations, comprehensive audits of these funds are difficult and the potential for graft is high.",2
poland,"Freely elected officials generally determine and implement laws and policies without interference, though PiS leader and former prime minister Jarosław Kaczyński retains significant influence on government affairs even after resigning as deputy prime minister in June 2022. Throughout its time in power, PiS has sought to limit parliamentary scrutiny of legislation through various means, such as making use of private-members bills that require no consultation or impact assessments; abruptly introducing legislation, sometimes in the middle of the night; and limiting opportunities for the opposition to question or amend legislation.",3,"PiS came to power promising to address corruption, cronyism, and nepotism. Cronyism, a problem under all previous Polish governments, is widespread under PiS. The current government has altered, lowered, or removed many criteria for staffing of public institutions, allowing for appointments based on party loyalty and personal connections.In past years, the NIK has raised concerns about the misuse of public funds by PiS and its coalition partners. NIK chief Marian Banaś, a PiS appointee, has himself been investigated over his financial dealings, which he claimed were politically motivated. In January 2022, Banaś warned a Senate committee that the NIK was considering compelling Jarosław Kaczyński’s testimony over the use of Pegasus.In January 2022, criminal-code amendments that enshrined conflict-of-interest measures and banned public officials from taking posts in some state-owned enterprises took effect. The amended code includes new prison sentences for corruption; some “repeat” offenses could be punished with a life sentence.",3,"The right to public information is guaranteed by the constitution and by the 2001 Act on Access to Public Information but obtaining records and data from public institutions can be slow and difficult.The current government avoids consulting outside experts or NGOs on policy ideas and tends to introduce and pass legislation rapidly, with little opportunity for debate or amendment.Beginning in 2021, the government faced a string of scandals when official correspondence was leaked from private email accounts; it blamed the leak on Kremlin-backed Russian hackers and claimed that some of the emails were inauthentic components of a Russian disinformation campaign. In September 2022, Michał Dworczyk, Prime Minister Moraweicki’s chief of staff, resigned over the leak of his emails, which revealed that Dworczyk met with TK chair Julia Przyłębska with the apparent aim of postponing some of its rulings.",2

In June 2022, former prime minister José Sócrates was ordered to report to the police twice monthly while awaiting trial on charges of money laundering and falsifying documents. He had originally been arrested in 2014.While several laws to enhance accountability and transparency for elected officials were approved in 2019, enforcement and effectiveness remained unproven, and resources for auditors, police, and prosecutors were inadequate. A September 2022 report by the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) concluded that Portugal needs to strengthen its efforts to detect corruption and conflicts of interest, and to monitor and verify high-level officials’ asset declarations. The European Commission’s 2022 report on the rule of law also cited concerns regarding a lack of resources for the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of corruption-related cases. Government statistics showed a significant increase in the backlog of unresolved corruption cases over the past several years.Whistleblower protections are in place, but controversy surrounded the case of Rui Pinto, a hacker-turned-whistleblower who leaked troves of documents related to the business activities of European soccer clubs.

Romania maintains a comprehensive anticorruption action plan, though the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) noted in a 2020 report that anticorruption bodies face pressure when pursuing high-level cases.The National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) previously won international praise for fairly investigating corruption cases and securing convictions of powerful figures. However, the 2018 dismissal of DNA chief Laura Codruţa Kövesi was seen as a blow to its independence. Kövesi won a European Court of Human Rights judgment over her dismissal in 2020. In a September 2022 ceremony marking 20 years of activity, the DNA noted that it had prosecuted more than 15,000 people accused of corruption.

russia,"President Putin dominates the political system, along with powerful allies in the security services and the business sector. These groups effectively control the output of the parliament, which is not freely elected. The 2020 constitutional amendments formalized the power of the president over the legislature and allow Putin to retain the presidency until 2036. Legislation passed in 2021 increased political centralization at the expense of regional autonomy. However, the federal authorities have limited ability to impose policy decisions in Chechnya, where Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been granted unchecked power in exchange for violently suppressing dissent and keeping the republic within the Russian Federation.",0,"Corruption in the government and the business world is pervasive, and a lack of accountability enables officials to engage in malfeasance with impunity. Many analysts have argued that the political system is essentially a kleptocracy, a regime whose defining characteristic is the plunder of public wealth by ruling elites. Some of these elites openly work to fulfill President Putin’s policy aims and receive government contracts and protection from prosecution in return for their loyalty.In December 2022, Putin exempted government officials, including individuals deployed to Ukraine, from following a 2008 anticorruption law that mandated the disclosure of income and assets. Putin’s decree also allowed Russian forces in Ukraine to receive “rewards and gifts” deemed humanitarian in nature.",1,"There is little transparency and accountability in the day-to-day workings of the government, particularly at the federal level where decisions are adopted behind closed doors by a small group of individuals.Official opacity further increased after the war in Ukraine began. The government restricted access to economic statistics, including trade data, as 2022 progressed, while the central bank allowed financial institutions to forgo publishing statements in March. In June, the Duma passed a bill that would make information on Russia’s currency and gold reserves a state secret in its first reading. Russian authorities are similarly opaque about the war itself, providing infrequent updates on casualties and providing figures that observers believe are significant undercounts. Soldiers’ relatives, meanwhile, report receiving misleading or false information about their loved ones.",1

Parliament, which generally lacks the independence to serve as a check on executive authority, tends to merely endorse presidential initiatives; it is able to play more of an oversight role on issues that are less politically sensitive, such as women’s rights, education, and public health.",1,"The government takes measures to limit corruption, including regular dismissals and prosecutions of officials who are suspected of malfeasance. In 2018, Parliament passed penal code revisions that expanded the list of corruption-related crimes and increased penalties for those convicted. Among other high-profile cases in recent years, a state minister responsible for cultural affairs at the Ministry of Youth and Culture was sentenced to four years in prison on corruption charges in September 2022. A lack of transparency surrounding such prosecutions makes it difficult to assess whether they are politically motivated.There are a number of institutions dedicated to detecting and punishing misuse of public funds, including the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority, the Office of the Auditor General, the Office of the Ombudsman, and specialized chambers for economic crimes. Nevertheless, graft remains a problem, and few independent organizations or media outlets are able to investigate or report on corruption issues due to the risk of government reprisals.",2,"While a 2013 law provides for public access to government information, implementation has been weak. Data published on Sobanukirwa, a website created by the government to ease the process of requesting access to documents, suggest that only a small fraction of requests result in positive and timely responses. Given the government’s active repression of any dissent in recent years, citizens do not have the ability in practice to obtain information about state operations, nor do they have a meaningful opportunity to comment on policy without the threat of punishment.",1

The reluctance of the new FAST government to swear in opposition members of Parliament in the wake of the postelection crisis in 2021 suggested ongoing political dysfunction.The FAST government encountered considerable resistance from within the senior echelons of the public service, which had long worked closely with the HRPP. The clerk of the Legislative Assembly and the attorney general, both of whom were involved in the constitutional crisis, were dismissed in September 2021, as was a top official at the Finance Ministry that August. An “open letter” that month from “affected and concerned public servants” criticized their treatment by the new government and was referred to the Public Service Commission. The FAST government has been restricted in its ability to determine government policy owing to a two-thirds requirement for constitutional amendments. For example, the previous HRPP government passed three laws in December 2020 that greatly alter the legal standing of the Land and Titles Court and reduce the powers of the Supreme Court. Owing to the absence of a two-thirds majority, the FAST government has instead insisted that a procedural technicality allows for the law to be reconsidered, which they began to do in August 2022.",3,"Independent entities including the Office of the Ombudsman, the Public Service Commission, and law enforcement agencies pursue allegations of corruption by public officials.

The report also highlighted the need to adopt a code of conduct for members of parliament. In response, in March 2022 the parliament adopted legislation that introduced a code of conduct for lawmakers, with provisions designed to better manage conflicts of interest and improve transparency through asset declarations. Also that month, the Judicial Council adopted a code of ethics for judges. GRECO officials expressed their approval of these reforms in June.In 2017, several former officials were convicted of bribery, corruption, money laundering, and vote buying as part of their involvement in the so-called Conto Mazzini case.

Although the government generates massive revenue from the sale of oil, which it redistributes through social welfare programs and as patronage, little is known about state accounting or the various direct ways in which public wealth becomes a source of private privilege for the royal family and its clients. Nontribal nepotism in government is also a challenge.The government has taken some steps to combat corruption and recover misappropriated assets, but its opaque methods have raised serious concerns about politicization and lack of due process. The crown prince heads an anticorruption committee, which in 2017 ordered the detention of more than 300 people, many of whom were coerced into turning over billions of dollars in assets to the state in out-of-court settlements. Mohammed bin Salman’s campaign initially targeted potential rivals within the royal family, leading observers to suggest that these crackdowns are meant to consolidate his political and economic control. Since 2020, the government has shifted its focus to offenses by lower-level officials. In July 2022, the national anticorruption body announced that it had arrested 78 officials accused of bribery, forgery, and money laundering, and 116 were investigated for several other crimes.",1,"The functioning of government is not transparent.

In August 2022, before a new government took office, Vučić announced that the prime minister’s new mandate would extend only until 2024, rather than a full four-year term, due to unspecified “changes to the government.”The executive largely controls the legislative process, and opposition lawmakers are sidelined through the disproportionate use of disciplinary measures, frequent use of accelerated legislative procedures, and late changes to the legislative agenda, among other tactics.",2,"Although the number of arrests and prosecutions for corruption has risen in recent years, high-profile convictions are very rare. Critics have credibly accused Vučić and the SNS government of having ties to organized crime, and cronyism—in the form of jobs provided to allies of the president and the ruling party—is reportedly common. The responsibility for prosecuting corruption cases has been passed among different public prosecutors, who typically fault the police for supplying insufficient evidence in cases against government ministers. The work of the ACA is also undermined in part by the ambiguous division of responsibilities among other entities tasked with combating corruption.Notable cases that came to light in recent years without being resolved include those of Nenad Popović, a politician who was implicated in a questionable privatization that caused an electrical transformer manufacturer to declare bankruptcy; finance minister Siniša Mali, whom anticorruption agencies have investigated for suspected money laundering; and former health minister Zlatibor Lončar, who allegedly has links to an organized crime group. Senior officials’ close relatives and associates have also faced corruption allegations. For example, a series of reports and leaked documents since 2018 tied the father of then interior minister Nebojša Stefanović to an arms-trading scheme and other malfeasance. Aleksandar Obradović, a whistleblower who implicated Stefanović’s father in the purchase of arms from the state at reduced rates, was arrested in September 2019, potentially deterring others with knowledge of corruption from coming forward.",1,"The government has received sustained criticism for a lack of transparency in large-scale infrastructure projects and for secrecy surrounding public tenders.

Serbian defense spending is also opaque. Legislators do not have adequate opportunities to ask questions about government activities and legislation, and the vast majority of parliamentary questions go unanswered by the government.Public officials are subject to asset disclosure rules overseen by the ACA, but penalties for violations are uncommon.

In April 2022, former prime minister Robert Fico and his interior minister, Robert Kaliňák, were charged with establishing an organized criminal group. In November, however, prosecutor general Maroš Žilinka used a controversial paragraph of the Criminal Code to scrap charges against the two, citing lack of evidence for the crimes. Nevertheless, police were ordered to further investigate the matter.The prosecutor general used the same prerogative to scrap charges in several other high-profile cases, including ones against former finance minister Peter Kažimír, currently the head of the National Bank of Slovakia; the former head of the Slovak Information Service, Vladimír Pčolinský, who was nominated by the Matovič’s government; and the tycoon Jaroslav Haščák. All had been charged with bribery and misuse of power.

Journalists proactively expose allegations of corruption.Concerns over corruption persisted in 2022. In April, the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (KPK) said that then prime minister Janša did not follow conflict-of-interest procedures when making one of his associates a nonexecutive director of the Bank Assets Management Company. The Slovenian chapter of Transparency International (TI) called on officials to address conflict-of-interest concerns in response to the KPK report. Also in April, the KPK criticized officials for implying that anticorruption legislation could be ignored. In July, TI’s Slovenian chapter publicly supported a bill protecting whistleblowers—a draft of which was accepted by the Golob government in October—and called for greater integrity in local government. In December, Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar resigned, accusing Prime Minister Golob of undue interference over her desired appointments to the police force. Bobnar vowed to share allegations with the KPK and prosecutors.",3,"The government generally operates with openness.In July 2022, the European Commission (EC) reported that Slovenia placed ahead of the average for European Union (EU) member states in its Digital Economy and Society Index; the EC specifically noted that Slovenia’s share of e-government users was larger than the EU average.The GS-led coalition sought to improve government transparency on health-care issues in 2022. In June, the National Assembly backed an amended Communicable Diseases Act (ZNB) that allowed for greater parliamentary oversight over health-related restrictions; the Janša government had amended the ZNB to pass coronavirus-related restrictions by decree and without public consultation in 2021. In July 2022, the National Assembly abolished public procurement rules dating back to 2021 via new health care legislation.

solomon-islands,"Solomon Islands governments have generally been able to determine national policy without outside interference, but the country’s fractious politics hamper efficient policymaking. Prime ministers have struggled to sustain legislative majorities, and cabinet splits are frequent. Critics have raised concerns that the Solomon Islands has increasingly aligned itself with the Chinese government after Prime Minister Sogavare switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 2019, opening up opportunities for the Chinese government to influence policy decisions.",3,"Corruption and abuse of office are serious problems. The Hou government secured passage of the Anti-Corruption Act, which established an independent anticorruption commission, and the Whistleblowers Protection Act. Some opposition members of Parliament considered the laws ineffective, as they allowed the use of local custom as a defense in corruption cases and restricted retroactive application. Under both the Sogavare and Hou governments, a number of senior officials were investigated or arrested on corruption charges due to the efforts of Task Force Janus, a joint anticorruption initiative between the police force and the Finance Ministry. However, prosecutors have had difficulty winning convictions against politicians accused of corruption. Task Force Janus operations slowed between 2020 and 2022, and the Solomon Islands Independent Commission Against Corruption (SIICAC) has been slow to commence operations, though efforts began to accelerate in the final months of 2022.",3,"Successive governments have not operated transparently.

south-africa,"Pervasive corruption and apparent interference by nonelected actors have hampered the proper functioning of government, particularly during the Zuma administration. In 2018, Zuma was forced by the High Court to appoint a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into state capture (external influence held over an administration). When he came into power, President Ramaphosa amended the terms of the state capture inquiry to enable the evidence gathered by the Commission—headed by then deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo and commonly known as the Zondo Commission—to be used in prosecutions. Zuma has since been waging a legal fight to fend off the Commission’s demands after he had been implicated by over 30 witnesses in several instances of wrongdoing. Zuma was arrested in July 2021 for failing to appear before Commission meetings.President Ramaphosa testified twice at the Judicial Commission of Inquiry, first in his capacity as ANC president and secondly as president and former deputy president of the republic. He admitted in his testimony that there had been significant state capture during Zuma’s presidency.The final report of the Zondo Commission was released in June 2022, and recommends that the government investigate and prosecute several high-level ANC politicians on criminal corruption charges. According to the report, the governing ANC enabled corruption on a large scale during the Zuma administration, especially through the awarding of government contracts to businesses owned by or linked to the Gupta business family. Among other things, the report also found that numerous political actors had participated in the theft of state resources during the Zuma administration, and that Zuma had awarded government appointments in return for protection from investigations.",3,"Comprehensive anticorruption laws and several agencies tasked with combating corruption exist, but enforcement has historically been inadequate. Several former and current government officials accused of corruption have not been prosecuted. The Auditor General has outlined in past annual reports that accountability failures have not been addressed. The August 2021 murder of Babita Deokaran, a whistleblower who tipped off the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to corruption in the Gauteng health department, suggests that protection measures for whistleblowers are weak. A 2022 media investigation into Deokaran’s death revealed extensive corruption within the public procurement processes of the local government in Gauteng, the country’s wealthiest province. In October 2022, partially in response to the findings of the Zondo Commission, President Ramaphosa announced that his administration plans to introduce far-reaching reforms to combat corruption within the government, including establishing an independent public procurement agency and creating new mechanisms to protect whistleblowers. President Ramaphosa was the subject of a number of corruption-related investigations during 2022, including by the country’s Public Protector’s office, which investigates complaints of government misconduct. In June, public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane began an investigation into claims made by former intelligence officer Arthur Fraser that Ramaphosa had unlawfully hidden at least $4 million in cash—the origin of which is unknown—at his Phala Phala farm, as well as covered up the theft of the money in 2020. One day after the investigation was announced, the president suspended Mkhwebane on grounds of her alleged “incapacity and misconduct.” Mkhwebane’s suspension was lifted in September by a High Court ruling that it could “reasonably be seen as retaliation” for her investigation into the so-called Phala Phala scandal. Investigations into Ramaphosa were ongoing as of December; he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.",2,"Section 32(1) of the South African constitution states that everyone has the right to access “any information held by the state” and requires that private bodies release information necessary for the exercise and protection of rights. The 2000 Promotion of Access to Information Act created a framework for access to information procedures in both public and private entities. However, in practice the procedure of accessing information is laborious and bureaucratic. A lack of transparency and a lack of competitive bidding have affected the awarding of government contracts. President Ramaphosa promised to reform the government’s procurement system after evidence of wide-scale corruption emerged during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020; he again promised reforms in 2022 in response to the findings of the Zondo Commission on state capture.",3

Conflict-of-interest legislation for public servants took effect in May 2022.Officials appointed during the Moon administration came under scrutiny for their conduct during 2022. In August, the BAI began an audit of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission over absenteeism allegations that included chairperson Jeon Hyun-heui, a Moon appointee; Jeon reported she was facing pressure to resign. As of December, the BAI was considering whether to question Hong Jang-pyo, a Moon administration official, over allegations that the previous administration manipulated economic data.DP aides and officials, including Lee Jae-myung, came under scrutiny over their conduct relating to a land-development project in Seongnam, where Lee served as mayor between 2010 and 2018. Lee was indicted for violating election laws by allegedly disseminating false information over the affair in September 2022. A staff member of a DP-affiliated think tank was arrested over bribery allegations in October, while a Lee ally in the DP was indicted in December. Authorities raided the offices of the think tank in October, searching for evidence that Lee accepted illegal funds related to the land project.An investigation into speculative land purchases based on insider information via the Korea Land and Housing Corporation ended in March 2022; a total of 4,251 people were referred to prosecutors, 64 were arrested, and 150.7 billion won ($116.3 million) in profits were seized.In December 2022, Yoon said he would pardon former president Lee Myung-bak, who received a corruption-related prison sentence in 2018 and exhausted his appeals in 2020.",3,"A 1998 public-disclosure law allows citizens and resident foreigners to request access to the records of public agencies, except those related to national security.

Most party expenses are funded by the state, but political parties can access commercial bank loans. Over the past decade, lawmakers have imposed some restrictions on such private sources of funding, prohibited banks from forgiving party debt, strengthened rules on asset disclosure and conflicts of interest for high-ranking officials, and enacted more severe penalties for corruption-related crimes. Nevertheless, the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) has called for additional efforts. The penal code revisions that were adopted in December 2022 included reduced sentences for misuse of public funds, raising concerns that it could harm anticorruption efforts. Although the courts have a solid record of investigating and prosecuting corruption cases, the system is often overburdened, and cases move slowly. Among other high-profile proceedings during 2022, the Supreme Court in July ratified the sentences of several former PSOE officials from Andalucía’s regional government who had overseen a fraudulent system for distributing social and labor benefits, with one defendant, a former regional president, receiving six years in prison. In March, prosecutors dropped a series of investigations into possible tax evasion and money laundering by former king Juan Carlos I, citing a lack of evidence as well as legal obstacles including the statute of limitations.",3,"Legal safeguards to ensure government transparency include asset-disclosure rules for public officials and laws governing conflicts of interest.

That same year, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime provided manuals for the CAC to help it enforce the new law.",2,"Despite attempts to make budgets more accessible, procurement processes remain largely opaque. Requests for public information are not always granted and may require applicants to undertake inconvenient travel. Information may be issued in Portuguese, which most Timorese do not speak.

togo,The president holds most policymaking power. The UNIR-controlled National Assembly  does not effectively check the executive. A pattern of flawed elections has undermined the legitimacy of both branches.,2,"Corruption is a serious and long-standing problem. The government has adopted legislation ostensibly designed to reduce corruption, such as a 2018 law on money laundering and funding terrorism, but these legal changes have not been effectively enforced, nor have high-ranking officials been convicted. Most members of the High Authority for the Prevention and Fight against Corruption and Related Offenses (HAPLUCIA) are presidential appointees, raising concerns about the body’s independence. HAPLUCIA cannot prosecute cases itself and must make referrals to the public prosecutor. In September 2022, HAPLUCIA and the West African Development Bank signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate in anticorruption efforts.",1,"A 2016 freedom-of-information law guarantees the right to access government information, though some information is exempted, and the government does not always respond to requests. Most public officials are not required to disclose their assets. There is a lack of transparency regarding state tenders.",2
tonga,"The elected prime minister and his cabinet largely control the formulation and implementation of government policy, but the king continues to rely on the Privy Council—whose members he appoints himself—for advice regarding the use of his constitutional powers. The Privy Council operates like a shadow government, facilitating a continuing political role for the monarch.",3,"Corruption and abuse of office are serious problems. While public officials and leaders of state-owned companies are sometimes held to account for bribery and other malfeasance, anticorruption mechanisms are generally weak and lacking in resources.Numerous high-profile politicians and government officials were convicted of corruption charges during 2022. In May, Tongan courts convicted three high-ranking politicians of bribing voters during the 2021 election campaign and declared their elections void. All three ministers—deputy prime minister Poasi Tei, finance minister Tatafu Moeaki, and internal affairs minister Sangster Saulala—were removed from their parliamentary seats after the Supreme Court dismissed their appeals in August.In April 2022, former prime minister Pōhiva Tuʻiʻonetoa was convicted of bribing voters during the 2021 election period; following the verdict, the court voided Tuʻiʻonetoa’s 2021 election. Tuʻiʻonetoa was convicted of additional bribery charges in June 2022. Both convictions were overturned on appeal in August, allowing Tuʻiʻonetoa to keep his seat in the parliament.",3,"Tonga does not have a law to guarantee public access to government information, which can be difficult to obtain in practice, and officials are not legally obliged to disclose their assets and income. The government has at times resisted public scrutiny of pending policies or auditor general’s reports.",2
trinidad-and-tobago,Freely elected executive and legislative officeholders generally determine and implement government policies without undue interference.,4,"Corruption remains a pervasive problem, especially within the police force and among high-ranking government officials and immigration officers. Several pieces of anticorruption legislation exist but are generally poorly enforced.In 2019, former attorney general Anand Ramlogan and former senator Gerald Ramdeen, both of the UNC, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering. However, the charges against both men were dropped in October 2022. At the time the charges were dropped, the key witness in the case was pursuing a civil case against the government. The civil case was based on the witness’s claims that former PNM attorney general Faris Al-Rawi had offered him an indemnity agreement before he agreed to implicate Ramlogan and Ramdeen, but that the agreement was later breached.Other alleged cases of official corruption and mismanagement emerged in 2022, including wide-scale fraud in the Ministry of Social Development and Family Services, which allegedly involved the misuse of state grants; and in the Ministry of Agriculture, Land, and Fisheries, which came under investigation following allegations of illegal land transactions. Additionally, both public and private sector stakeholders, including the police and security experts, have expressed concern about corruption in the Customs and Excise Division, which is under the control of the Ministry of Finance, and the division’s possible role in facilitating the illegal gun trade.",2,"Public officials are required to disclose their assets, income, and liabilities, but penalties against those who fail to comply are limited. The Integrity Commission, which is tasked with overseeing these financial disclosures, has been criticized for being ineffective. The public has the right to access government documents by law, although numerous public institutions are exempt. Furthermore, there is no enforcement of a provision that requires the government to respond to information requests within 30 days. A 2015 law regulating public procurements was implemented in 2020, but with significant exemptions.",3
tunisia,"Conflict over the division of powers between the legislative and executive branches has undermined policymaking and governance since 2011. Late president Essebsi manipulated the national budget in such a way that the parliament was deeply underfunded, leaving it with limited ability or resources to craft legislation on its own or check executive authority. Clashes between the executive and legislative branches continued under Saïed, culminating in his emergency powers declaration on July 25, 2021. The move to suspend the parliament effectively allowed Saïed to rule by decree, with elected lawmakers playing no role. The new government of Prime Minister Bouden took office that October without the constitutionally required approval from parliament, and it remained responsible only to the president.In 2022, Saïed and his appointed government continued to govern unilaterally, without input from an elected legislature, and the new constitution adopted in July 2022 formally concentrated power in the presidency. Among other changes, it eliminated the parliament’s ability to impeach the president and requires a two-thirds majority for the parliament to remove the prime minister and cabinet.",1,"Tunisia’s anticorruption legislation has historically been considered weak. The Economic Reconciliation Law of 2017 effectively offered amnesty for those implicated in corruption under the pre-2011 regime of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, though its initial provisions were partly rolled back due to public disapproval. President Saïed issued a decree in March 2022 that expanded the concept of “criminal reconciliation,” allowing businesspeople facing corruption charges to avoid punishment by repaying allegedly stolen funds or investing them in designated regional development projects. The process was to be managed by a commission appointed by the president. The National Commission for the Fight against Corruption (INLUCC) was established in 2011, and a permanent body, the Commission on Good Governance and the Fight against Corruption (IBGLCC), was meant to replace it under the 2014 constitution. While legislation intended to establish the IBGLCC was passed in 2017, the new body remained inactive. INLUCC thus continued its operations with inadequate funding and little authority to compel legal action. President Saïed justified his seizure of power in July 2021 in part by arguing that it was necessary to uproot corruption in the political establishment, but his administration’s subsequent steps led critics to accuse the president of instrumentalizing anticorruption efforts to eliminate his political enemies. Police shut down INLUCC’s headquarters in August 2021, and in March 2022 INLUCC employees organized a sit-in to protest the nonpayment of their salaries and the freezing of their work. In October 2022, the president installed Nadia Saadi as temporary head of INLUCC by decree, but the organization’s future remained uncertain.",1,"President Saïed’s centralization of power after July 2021 exacerbated the government’s existing opacity regarding official decision-making and actions by law enforcement agencies. Al-Bawsala, a nonproft organization that promotes transparency and accountability, has criticized ruling elites from all parties over their lack of responsiveness to the public, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2016 freedom of information law was faulted by watchdog groups for its security-related exemptions.A 2018 law requires the president, ministers, and high-level public officials, among others, to declare their assets to INLUCC; penalties for violating the law include large fines and prison terms of up to five years. Members of the Bouden government reportedly declared their assets in October 2021.",2
turkey,"Erdoğan controls all executive functions, rules by decree, and makes all policy decisions. Since 2016, he has overhauled Turkey’s ministries and agencies, purging tens of thousands of civil servants and replacing them with political loyalists. He exerts effective control over the legislature through his leadership of the AKP; lawmakers’ capacity to provide policy contributions has greatly eroded under the new presidential system in effect since 2018.Erdoğan frequently intervenes against ministries and independent public bodies that defy his wishes. For example, he replaced Turkey’s central bank chief three times between 2019 and 2021 and fired three of the bank’s top executives in 2021, the latter move prompting a rare backlash from Turkey’s top business association. In January 2022, Erdoğan removed the head of Turkey’s Statistical Institute (TÜİK) less than a year after his appointment, which many attributed to TÜİK’s growing political influence amid worsening inflation rates.",2,"Corruption remains a major problem, including at the highest levels of government. Enforcement of anticorruption laws is inconsistent, and anticorruption agencies are ineffective, creating a culture of impunity. A handful of holding companies obtain a vast portion of public tenders and control most of Turkey’s media networks. The government has seized hundreds of businesses and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) since 2016, appointing trustees to manage billions of dollars in assets.In 2021 and 2022, notorious mafia boss Sedat Peker published a series of videos in which he levied an array of accusations—including murder, rape, corruption, and drug trafficking—against prominent government figures, including Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu. Although opposition parties have made multiple requests for parliamentary and judicial inquiries into the allegations, the ruling AKP-led coalition has quashed the motions and no authority has opened an investigation into Peker’s claims.",1,"Turkey’s political and legal environment has made democratic oversight of the government nearly impossible. Despite laws guaranteeing access to information, the government withholds information on the activities of state officials and institutions. Public officials are widely accused of publishing distorted data to downplay Turkey’s problems, including COVID-19 infection rates and inflation and unemployment rates. In March 2022, the TÜİK filed a criminal defamation complaint against an economic research group after it published unofficial data showing the inflation rate as being much higher than what had been disclosed by the government. Civil society leaders and journalists are routinely denied access to government officials, meetings, and events.",0

Anticorruption bodies have allegedly been used to extort revenue from wealthy officials and businesspeople. Crackdowns on corruption are typically selective and related to conflicts within the ruling elite.Genuine checks on nepotism and conflicts of interest are lacking. Corruption is widespread across the public sector.

Government officials and state-owned companies are not required to disclose their basic financial information to the public.As in 2020 and 2021, the government continued to deny the presence of the COVID-19 virus in Turkmenistan throughout 2022, despite their implementation of a nationwide quarantine to prevent the spread of respiratory disease in January, and after lifting restrictions, instituting the measures again in July.",0
tuvalu,"Tuvalu’s elected officials develop and implement government policies and legislation without improper interference from any unelected entity. The country often receives funding from other countries and international entities to implement policies and programs. The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and partner countries provide the country with grants, but there have been no reported concerns of undue influence on government.In 2019, the government reaffirmed its commitment to its relationship with Taiwan, which precludes any diplomatic ties with China and thus any influence Beijing might have on Funafuti. The prime minister visited Taiwan in September 2022.",4,"Corruption is not a severe problem in Tuvalu, and the country’s independent auditing and law enforcement bodies are generally effective in combating graft.Tuvalu has received assistance from international donors to strengthen anticorruption laws.",3,"Government operations and legislative processes are generally transparent, though there is no freedom-of-information law to guarantee and regulate public access to official records. While officials are legally obliged to disclose their assets and income, the rules are not consistently enforced, according to the US State Department.The government has sought to use technology, in part to disseminate information on official decisions that otherwise take days to reach the public. In 2019, Parliament livestreamed government proceedings on social media for the first time. In 2020, the government announced plans to become a “paperless society” by using blockchain technology to create a national digital ledger in which all public data would be stored.

The executive secures passage of key legislation through inducement, harassment, and intimidation of the legislative branch.",1,"Despite laws and institutions designed to combat official malfeasance, including the Anti-Corruption Act of 2009 and the Inspectorate of Government, corruption remains a significant problem. A December 2021 Inspectorate of Government report found that the country loses an estimated $5.5 billion annually to corruption in key government agencies, and $161.7 million in fraudulent procurement deals. Petty corruption also characterizes many government services, notably the Uganda Police Force.",1,"Many government departments deny requests for information under the Access to Information Act (AIA), and laws related to national security and confidentiality impede open access to information in practice. Government agencies seem to release information that only favors the regime. For example, in 2020, the EC made public the academic documents of Wine while refusing to release those of President Museveni, despite numerous petitions. Public procurement decisions are generally opaque.In October 2022, President Museveni announced new lockdown restrictions to curb the spread of an outbreak of Ebola. The government was initially hesitant to address the outbreak of the virus, which began in September, likely resulting in an increased number of deaths.",1
ukraine,"Elected officials craft and implement reforms, though many initiatives stall due to opposition from powerful business groups and other special interests. The main obstacle to effective governance in government-controlled parts of Ukraine is corruption.The elected government is unable to exercise full control over Ukrainian territories that are under Russian occupation, which following the 2022 invasion amounted to more than 15 percent of the country.",2,"Corruption remains a serious problem, and the political will to fight it has been inconsistent. Anticorruption agencies have repeatedly been ensnared in politically fraught conflicts with other state entities and elected officials. In a ruling published in 2020, the Constitutional Court restricted many of the powers held by the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, impairing its ability to function.In July 2022, in response to recommendations that accompanied the EU decision to grant Ukraine candidate status, Ukrainian leaders finally appointed experienced investigator Oleksandr Klymenko as the head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, after a long selection process that followed his predecessor’s resignation nearly two years earlier. Klymenko reopened a number of stalled cases and opened a new case against lawmaker Andriy Derkach for allegedly receiving payments from Russian intelligence agencies in exchange for planning subversive activities against Ukraine.In May 2022, the parliament registered a draft law under which individuals facing criminal corruption charges for the first time could avoid penalties if they compensated in full for any financial damage they had caused. The authors of the draft law, which would apply during the period of martial law, claimed to be motivated by a desire to conserve law enforcement resources and replenish the national budget through restitution from corrupt officials. Critics viewed the measure as an avenue for corrupt officials to escape prosecution for crimes committed prior to the 2022 invasion. In June 2022, the parliament adopted an anticorruption strategy through 2025 that outlines key performance indicators and monitoring instruments for government bodies. The new strategy reflects and instructs closer coordination among various anticorruption institutions and government agencies, and prescribes public access to anticorruption monitoring and assessment reports.",1,"Since 2014, Ukraine has made significant progress on transparency, including through the digitization of city planning and public procurement, monitoring of public officials’ assets and lifestyles, and investigative journalism, yet endemic corruption remains a challenge. Estimates in 2021 still showed that Ukraine’s budget was losing $37 billion a year due to corruption. Asset declarations were weakened in 2020 as a result of a Constitutional Court decision; the court struck down the relevant law, and a new one with diluted requirements was later enacted.Government transparency has further declined as a result of the ongoing war and martial law. Parliamentary committee meetings are no longer open to the public as ordinarily required by law; meeting locations, times, and agendas are no longer disclosed in advance, ostensibly for security reasons.In May 2022, President Zelenskyy launched the “United 24” initiative to coordinate charitable donations in support of Ukraine. Critics argued that while the initiative was an efficient way to coordinate foreign assistance, it offered the president’s office another means of centralizing authority, as the distribution of funds was believed to be the responsibility of the cabinet, which is generally subordinate to the presidential administration. ",1

united-states,"The elected president and Congress are generally empowered to determine government policies and craft legislation. However, partisan polarization and obstruction in Congress has repeatedly delayed appropriations bills across multiple administrations, resulting in a series of partial shutdowns of federal government operations, most recently in 2018–19. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Republicans in the Senate effectively slowed the confirmation of Biden’s executive branch nominees, resulting in scores of vacant positions in the higher levels of government departments and agencies as of December. Such vacancies make it difficult or impossible for the relevant agencies to operate as intended by law.Congress’s ability to serve as a check on potential abuses by the executive was thrown into doubt during the Trump administration. After Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, the administration frequently clashed with Congress in ways that undermined the legislature’s constitutional oversight authority. Proposed reforms meant to address these problems by strengthening Congress’s oversight powers had yet to win passage in 2022.",3,"The United States benefits from strong structural safeguards against official corruption, including a traditionally independent law enforcement system, a free and vigorous press, and an active civil society sector. A variety of regulations and oversight institutions within government are designed to curb conflicts of interest and prevent other situations that could lead to malfeasance. However, regulations pertaining to the influence of money in US politics have long been criticized as an inadequate barrier against corruption.The practices of the Trump administration exposed additional weaknesses in existing norms of government ethics and probity, particularly with respect to conflicts of interest between officials’ public roles and private business activity, and the protection of government whistleblowers from arbitrary dismissal or other reprisals. Since 2021, lawmakers have advanced a number of bills meant to address these gaps in ethics rules, but the reform legislation failed to make significant progress during 2022.The Biden administration has issued executive orders that strengthened ethics rules within the executive branch, and watchdog groups described its efforts to limit cabinet members’ conflicts of interest as effective. However, critics continued to highlight ethics questions involving Biden’s son Hunter; Republicans campaigning in the 2022 midterms frequently pledged to launch congressional investigations of Hunter Biden’s business activities, and a federal probe was ongoing during the year.Separately, the stock-trading practices of scores of federal lawmakers have come under scrutiny for alleged conflicts of interest, prompting unsuccessful efforts in 2022 to advance legislation that would restrict members’ ability to trade stocks.",3,"The United States was the first country to adopt a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) over 50 years ago, and the law—along with its state-level counterparts—is actively used by journalists, civil society groups, researchers, and members of the public. A 2016 reform law was designed to improve government agencies’ responsiveness to FOIA requests, and reporters and activists were able to use FOIA filings to obtain important documents on the Trump administration that congressional investigators could not access through normal oversight requests or subpoenas. Nevertheless, government performance on FOIA requests declined during Trump’s presidency, and in 2020 the coronavirus-induced transition to remote work by government employees produced a sharp drop in responsiveness to information requests at the federal, state, and local levels. Complaints about serious backlogs and calls for further FOIA reform persisted through 2022.The executive branch includes a substantial number of auditing and investigative agencies that are designed to be independent of political influence; such bodies are often spurred to action by the investigative work of journalists. In 2020, however, Trump arbitrarily fired or replaced a series of agency inspectors general who had documented or investigated malfeasance by administration officials. In December 2022, Congress passed a spending bill that included provisions intended to reinforce the independence of inspectors general and protect them from presidential interference.",3

In January, a High Court judge ruled that the use of a “priority lane” to award test-and-trace contracts was illegal; in September, the government disclosed that 50 firms had benefited from priority contracts. In November, Michelle Mone, a Conservative member of the House of Lords, was revealed to have received £29 million ($35.2 million) in proceeds related to priority contracts; she remained under investigation by the upper house’s standards commissioner at year’s end.

uruguay,The head of government and national legislature determine the policies of the government without undue interference.,4,"The level of corruption in Uruguay is low by regional standards. Uruguay has repeatedly been ranked first in Latin America in the Capacity to Combat Corruption Index for its ability to detect, punish, and prevent corruption. However, the country registered its first score decline in 2022, largely due to the LUC. Critics have raised concerns that provisions in the LUC, including measures that allow for the easing of restrictions on cash transactions, might hinder Uruguay’s ability to monitor money laundering. In February 2022, well-known Uruguayan drug trafficker Sebastián Marset was released from prison in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he had been arrested in October 2021 for carrying a false passport. Marset was able to gain his release in part because he was issued a new Uruguayan passport while imprisoned in Dubai. In August 2022, Uruguayan authorities opened an official investigation into how Marset was able to obtain a new passport while incarcerated, and whether officials at Uruguay’s foreign and interior ministries had knowingly aided him in evading arrest; the investigation remained ongoing at year’s end. In September 2022, Alejandro Astesiano, the president’s head of security, was arrested for his alleged participation in a scheme to falsify documents and birth certificates to allow Russian citizens to illegitimately obtain Uruguayan passports. Government officials praised the transparency of the investigation into Astesiano and called his arrest a signal of institutional strength.",4,"Government institutions have established a robust record of accountability to the electorate.

uzbekistan,"The country’s leadership is not freely elected, and the legislature serves as a rubber stamp for the executive branch.",0,"Corruption is pervasive. Graft and bribery among low- and mid-level officials remain common and are at times conducted overtly and without subterfuge. However, petty corruption among traffic police and officials granting identification documents and registrations has been notably reduced in recent years by pilot programs that introduced video surveillance and traffic cameras.President Mirziyoyev has overseen an ongoing purge of the notoriously corrupt security and law enforcement services. Analysts contend that the purge is largely meant to neutralize security officials from the Karimov era and shift power to the president’s personal security service and the reformed National Guard, both of which are overseen by Mirziyoyev’s family members. In September and October 2022, the Mirziyoyev administration launched a shakeup of more recent appointees as well, removing the governors and mayors of 14 districts and cities in a 10-day period, including the mayor of Termez, Isroil Khudoiberdiyev. Khudoiberdiyev, two of his deputies, and four other officials were arrested in October on charges of embezzlement. In recent years, the government has pursued a broad program of privatization of state assets. According to a 2021 report by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a number of formerly state-owned assets have been sold to the family members of high-ranking government officials, sometimes at suspiciously low prices, leading to accusations of nepotism and corruption. Media discussion of corrupt practices has cautiously expanded since Karimov’s death, but in some cases the journalists and commentators involved have come under pressure.",0,"Government operations remain mostly opaque, but one of Mirziyoyev’s first acts as president in late 2016 was the creation of new online mechanisms that offered citizens the opportunity to file complaints, report problems, and request services. The initial program was overwhelmingly popular and was quickly expanded to all ministries and local government offices, requiring local officials to interact with citizens and demonstrate responsiveness.

The most recent presidential election was widely regarded as illegitimate, and the opposition-controlled legislature had no practical ability to carry out its constitutional mandate between 2015 and 2020, when it was replaced by a PSUV-dominated National Assembly.The Maduro regime has become increasingly dependent on economic, medical, military, and other assistance from foreign allies, particularly the governments of Russia, Cuba, Turkey, and Iran. In addition, leftist guerrilla groups from Colombia have increased their influence in Venezuelan cities near the border. According to UN investigators, the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group operates in the state of Bolívar and has an agreement with the government to control illegal mining activity.",0,"Corruption is rampant in Venezuela. The government’s economic policies—particularly its currency and price controls—offer significant opportunities for illicit market activity and collusion between public officials and organized crime networks. Authorities in jurisdictions including the United States, Canada, Panama, and the EU have imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials for corruption and other offenses that go uninvestigated in Venezuela. A journalistic investigation published in 2022 found that more than 20 individuals linked to corruption schemes involving the state-owned oil company held assets worth at least $273 million in Swiss bank accounts.",0,"There is virtually no transparency regarding government spending. The Maduro regime has also consistently failed to publish reliable crime and economic data, including monthly inflation statistics, the balance of payments, and annual gross domestic product. Observers have raised serious doubts about the veracity of government COVID-19 data, with NGOs and educational institutions calling official pandemic death figures noncredible.

vietnam,"The CPV leadership, which is not freely elected or accountable to the public, determines government policy and the legislative agenda.",0,"CPV and government leaders have acknowledged growing public discontent with corruption, and there has been an increase in corruption-related arrests in recent years. Multiple senior officials, including members of the Central Committee, have faced party disciplinary action and jail time. In June 2022, the health minister, the mayor of Hanoi, the head of the Hanoi Center for Disease Control, and dozens of other officials were dismissed from their posts and arrested in connection with a scandal that included price-fixing and bribery related to COVID-19 test kits. Also during the year, the government continued to investigate a corruption scandal related to COVID-19 repatriation flights. In late December, two deputy prime ministers were removed from their CPV Central Committee positions, reportedly for their roles in these scandals; their formal dismissal from the government was expected to follow in early 2023.Despite the recent crackdowns, enforcement of anticorruption laws is often selective and linked to political rivalries. Many top officials who have been detained or jailed belonged to a different CPV faction than that of Trọng, the general secretary. The CPV does not tolerate journalistic investigations, independent courts, or other autonomous bodies that might serve as external checks on corruption within the party.",2,"The CPV leadership operates with considerable opacity. The provisions of a 2016 access to information law are relatively weak.

The Houthis receive at least some support from Iran.Saudi and Emirati military forces have occupied several strategic portions of Yemeni territory during the war, including Al-Mahrah Governorate and the island of Socotra, respectively. Emirati and STC forces long disregarded the official government’s objections to their presence and quasi-governmental activities on Socotra; in July 2022, the PLC appointed an STC figure as Socotra’s governor, apparently formalizing the group’s local dominance.",0,"Government probity was minimal even before the outbreak of war in 2015, as a network of corruption and patronage established under Saleh remained entrenched in public institutions, and formal anticorruption mechanisms were largely ineffective. The disruption to legal commerce caused by the civil war has increased the role of smuggling and created further opportunities for graft. Food aid is often stolen and sold illegally by officials on all sides of the civil conflict, exacerbating a food-security crisis that has left millions at risk of malnutrition. In an effort to address perceived corruption, the PLC in July 2022 reshuffled cabinet members, replacing the oil and defense ministers.",0,"Government transparency, already limited prior to 2015, has deteriorated along with state institutions during the war. The only truly national institution that had initially continued to function during the conflict, the central bank, has been split between a government-backed version in Aden and a rebel-backed version in Sanaa since 2016.

In October, former health minister Chitalu Chilufya was arrested over allegations of official corruption. Also in October, the UK-based Financial Times reported that the ACC questioned Lungu-era defense minister Davies Chama over payments made by Glencore, a Swiss trading firm the ACC was investigating.

Highly publicized cases are thought to reflect political motivations as mainly opposition-aligned figures were arrested and prosecuted without thorough investigation; in September 2022, for example, the DEC apologized to Edgar Lungu for saying it seized property that belonged to him when it belonged to someone else. Relatively few corruption cases were closed during the year, with the ACC reporting 8 convictions out of 71 arrests as of November.

In June 2022, the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), a government anticorruption watchdog, reported 3.56 billion kwacha ($208.9 million) in suspicious transactions in 2021, up from 3.14 billion kwacha ($184.2 million) in 2020. FIC investigations found that powerful individuals and lawyers laundered money through real estate, construction projects, and offshore accounts. Several large bank accounts were also frozen.

Opposition figures have called on Hichilema to investigate growing allegations of corruption within his administration in 2022. In October, the PF called on Hichilema to dismiss a minister who allegedly sought a bribe over a hospital construction project; the administration cancelled the project in November.",2,"The Anti-Corruption Act, which requires some public officeholders to make financial declarations, is loosely enforced. An access-to-information bill was first drafted in 2002 but has not passed. Journalists, civil society groups, and constituents experience challenges obtaining information about state operations and government programs.

However, in 2022, the Hichilema administration regularly provided often-unprompted ministerial statements to lawmakers and subjected the budget-making process to legislative and public review. Information on public-sector recruitment, constituency projects, and empowerment funds was transparently shared.",2
zimbabwe,"The president and Parliament generally determine policies and legislation, but they lack strong electoral legitimacy. Parliament does not serve as an effective check on executive power.The military continues to interfere in civilian governance. Some officers received cabinet appointments following the 2017 coup, and senior commanders were rewarded with ambassadorships in 2019. ZANU-PF has also relied on veterans as a source of political support, with the party forming a league for veterans of the war for independence in 2017. That league held its first conference in September 2022.",1,"Corruption is endemic, and past revelations of large-scale graft did not lead to successful prosecutions. In early 2019, President Mnangagwa dismissed the existing Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) board and appointed the wife of a former general, a retired major, former opposition politicians, and civil society leaders to the body. Though ZACC continues to refer corruption cases to prosecutors, opposition leaders have called for it to be disbanded, accusing it of lacking the independence, capacity, and will to fulfill its mandate.Corruption features heavily in the government’s tender system. A waste-management agreement between the Harare city government and Geogenix, a firm owned by Albanian businessman Mirel Mërtiri, was awarded by the national government without a tender process. Transparency International criticized the deal in June 2022, saying its terms unfairly benefited Geogenix. While the municipal government attempted to suspend the deal, a government minister told it to abide by its terms in July.",1,"Government processes are generally opaque. Access to information is constitutionally protected, but restrictive laws limit the ability of media outlets and ordinary citizens to obtain government information.In 2020, new freedom-of-information legislation, which aimed to make some information freely available by replacing the restrictive Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), was enacted. The Freedom of Information Bill, one of the acts meant to replace the AIPPA, was criticized for being as restrictive as the old law when it was first gazetted in 2019. The Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa also noted that data-disclosure mechanisms for public bodies was voluntary under the bill.",1
