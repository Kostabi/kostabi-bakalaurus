afghanistan,"The IEA’s judiciary is structurally similar to the judiciary of the defunct republic. However, the branch was purged and is now staffed by Taliban and supporters who are considered sufficiently reliable by the regime. Women, meanwhile, are absent. The attorney general’s core responsibilities were stripped from that office by the regime.",0,"The Taliban do not recognize internationally accepted norms on due process. Their judges are supposed to operate under Hanafi jurisprudence instead of a clear code of procedure. Judges rely on confessions and uncorroborated witness testimony.In November 2022, Akhundzada issued a decree calling on judges and prosecutors to issue punishments consistent with the regime’s interpretation of Sharia. Later that month, reports emerged of people receiving corporal punishment for crimes including adultery, robbery, and corruption. Authorities administered whippings and amputations with little due process, as those facing corporal punishment were not allowed to employ counsel.",0,"While the Taliban have asserted their intention to restore security in Afghanistan after overthrowing the republic, the Afghan population remained acutely vulnerable to armed conflict and violence in 2022. The ISKP engaged in terrorist activity while the NRF continued to wage an insurgency in the north. However, the South Asia Terrorism Portal counted 1,653 terrorism-related deaths in 2022, far fewer than the 8,469 deaths reported in 2021. The ISKP claimed responsibility for attacks that killed or injured at least 700 people since the Taliban took power, according to HRW. In one of the attacks the ISKP launched in April, it used a remote explosive device to target a Shiite mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, killing 31 people. It also launched several attacks during the Ashura holiday in August, with UNAMA reporting that 120 were killed or injured. In September, an ISKP suicide bomber targeted the Russian embassy in Kabul, killing at least six people. In December, ISKP fighters attacked a Kabul hotel, killing several people.The NRF continued to engage in armed resistance during the year. In affected areas, the regime has arbitrarily detained and summarily executed suspected collaborators and has engaged in collective punishment.In June 2022, the regime launched a military operation against a short-lived uprising by one of its commanders in a Hazara-majority district of Sar-e Pul Province. The regime’s operation was accompanied by mass displacement, collective punishment, and accusations of summary executions.While the regime claimed it was observing an amnesty announced in 2021, military personnel who served the republic were killed or disappeared during the year, suggesting a concerted campaign against perceived enemies sanctioned by the leadership and the GDI.Since retaking power, the Taliban have instituted corporal punishment with little due process. In December 2022, the regime held its first public execution. Taliban also used violence against those perceived as dissenters or those who otherwise resisted edicts, norms, or individual demands. In November, for example, a vice-and-virtue official killed a girl in Balkh Province for refusing a marriage proposal. Criminal violence is a regular occurrence. Perpetrators frequently benefited from Taliban protection or affiliation.",0,"The IEA operates without a unified civil or criminal code. There is no clarity on which republic-era laws still apply. Women face profound discrimination under the Taliban. Their employment opportunities have been severely curtailed; many women have been dismissed from public-sector and media-sector jobs. Restrictions on movement also impact women’s employment prospects, with the MVV working to enforce a ban on women using mass transit unaccompanied. The regime has also restricted girls’ and women’s access to education. In March 2022, it officially closed secondary schools for girls despite previous assurances that they would be reopened; Akhundzada reportedly vetoed the reopening of those schools. In December, the regime banned female students from higher education.The Taliban have engaged in discrimination against members of ethnic minority groups, particularly Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. There is no legal protection for LGBT+ people, who face societal disapproval and discrimination from the Taliban. In a 2021 interview, a Taliban judge advocated for the execution of men who engage in same-sex activity. LGBT+ people trying to flee Afghanistan face financial and administrative obstacles; gender nonconforming Afghans who spoke to HRW for a report released in January 2022 said they feared visiting passport offices and internal checkpoints.",0
albania,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but corruption remains a serious problem, underfunded courts are subject to political pressure and influence, and public trust in judicial institutions is low.In 2021, the Assembly adopted amendments to 10 laws in an effort to strengthen judicial efficiency. International governance bodies praised the subsequent reevaluation of judges and prosecutors via judicial vetting mechanisms. All priority cases had been reviewed by that September; more than 60 percent of all cases reviewed had resulted in dismissals “due to unexplained assets.” The vetting process continued in 2022; in April, Tirana chief prosecutor Elizabeta Imeraj was dismissed over concerns regarding her family’s assets.",2,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are upheld inconsistently. Trial procedures can be affected by corruption and are sometimes closed to the public. Although the state is supposed to offer free legal aid, legal counsel is not always provided to those who cannot afford their own. A number of local NGOs offer free legal aid for those affected.",2,"Reports of police abuse of detainees continue. Prison inmates suffer from poor living conditions and inadequate medical treatment. Drug-related crime remains a problem, as Albania is a transit country for heroin smugglers. Tribal law is practiced in parts of northern Albania, and sometimes involves revenge killings.",2,"The Roma community faces significant discrimination in education, health care, employment, and housing.A 2010 law bars discrimination based on race and several other categories, including sexual orientation and gender identity, and a 2013 reform of the criminal code introduced protections against hate crimes and hate speech based on sexual orientation and gender identity. A May 2022 pride parade in Tirana attracted significant support. However, anti-LGBT+ bias persists.Women are underrepresented in the workforce. Women living in rural areas have fewer opportunities for employment and education.",3
algeria,"The judiciary is susceptible to pressure from the civilian government and the military. Judges are appointed by the High Council of the Judiciary (CSM), which is headed by the president, although the 2020 constitutional reforms removed the justice minister and attorney general from the body. Two representatives of the judges’ union and the chair of the National Human Rights Council were added.Concerns regarding the judiciary’s independence persist despite these reforms. In 2021, the CSM expelled Sadedin Merzoug, a Hirak supporter, from the judiciary for expressing prodemocracy views, claiming that he had obstructed justice and violated his duty of confidentiality.",1,"The lack of judicial and prosecutorial independence often erodes the due process rights of defendants, particularly in politically sensitive cases against former officials or civic activists. Lengthy delays in bringing defendants to trial are common, and prosecutors’ requests to extend pretrial detention periods are typically granted. Security forces frequently conduct warrantless searches and engage in arbitrary arrests and short-term detentions. According to the National Committee for the Release of Detainees (CNLD), more than 300 political prisoners were being held as of April 2022, many in pretrial detention. In October 2022, Hirak activist Abdelhamid Bouziza was forcibly disappeared after being arrested by security forces. He was found 20 days later, in detention nearly 300 miles from where he was arrested. In a similar case, Slimane Bouhafs, an Algerian refugee in Tunisia, was abducted and forcibly disappeared by unidentified men in August 2021; he was located four days later in Algerian custody. Bouhafs was sentenced in December 2022 to three years in prison and a 100,000 dinar ($700) fine after being accused of ties to the MAK. The exact circumstances of his forced return to Algeria remained unclear.",1,"A 2006 reconciliation law gave immunity to Islamist and state perpetrators of serious crimes during the civil war, while compensating families of those who were subject to such crimes, which included forced disappearances. The reconciliation law also criminalized public discussion on the fate of the disappeared.Allegations of torture have decreased since the civil war’s end, but human rights activists still accuse the police of using excessive force and abusing detainees. In August 2022, pro-Hirak activist and whistleblower Mohamed Benhalima reported that he had been tortured in pretrial detention. Prison conditions are poor, with some inmates reportedly facing significant overcrowding and poor sanitation. Terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Islamic State (IS) militant group, continue to operate in Algeria. However, attacks have grown less frequent in recent years.",2,"Officials have made gradual efforts to address the Amazigh community’s cultural demands. Tamazight, the Berber language, became a national language in 1995, allowing it to be taught officially in schools serving Amazigh areas. Tamazight received the status of an official language nationwide through a 2016 constitutional amendment, meaning it could be used in administrative documents. The 2020 constitutional revisions made it impossible to change the status of Tamazight as a national language. However, Arabic remains the prevailing language of government.The constitution guarantees gender equality, but women continue to face both legal and societal discrimination. Many women receive lower wages than men in similar positions, and there are few women in company leadership posts. Sexual harassment, while punishable with fines and jail time, is nevertheless common in workplaces. NGOs dedicated to women’s rights have become more vocal as part of the Hirak, calling for a renewed commitment to the constitutional promise of gender equality.LGBT+ people face discrimination and violence, and many LGBT+ activists have fled the country. Same-sex sexual activity is punishable with prison sentences as long as two years. LGBT+ Algerians face mistreatment at the hands of police and discrimination by health care providers and employers.About 175,000 Sahrawis from Western Sahara live in refugee camps near the border with Morocco. The camps have been present since 1975, in a remote desert region with limited job opportunities. About 90,000 of the residents are considered “vulnerable” by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as they rely on humanitarian assistance for food, water, and education.Sub-Saharan African migrants, including refugees and asylum seekers, are subject to racial discrimination in Algeria and are often arbitrarily arrested and deported from the country—or simply abandoned at the southern desert borders—without being given the opportunity to challenge the actions in court. In September 2022 alone, more than 1,500 sub-Saharan migrants were expelled from Algeria and left at the border with Niger.",2
andorra,"The judiciary is impartial and independent and is generally free from pressure from the government. Judges are appointed and supervised by the Higher Council of Justice; the two co-princes, the speaker of parliament, and the prime minister each select one of the council’s five members, and the fifth is elected by judges and magistrates.",4,"Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial, and due process is generally upheld in the criminal justice system. The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, but police can detain suspects for up to 48 hours without charge.",4,"Andorra is free from war and insurgencies, violent crimes rates are low, and law enforcement agents are not known to use excessive force against civilians. Prison conditions are adequate.",4,"Though the 2019 law on equal treatment and nondiscrimination focuses primarily on combating gender discrimination, it includes comprehensive protections against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and other such categories. The legislation provides enforcement mechanisms, including fines, and also seeks to address a persistent gender pay gap, estimated to be as high as 40 percent in some sectors. A report published by a women’s rights organization in 2020 described ongoing problems including discrimination in the labor market and gender-based violence.Andorra provides temporary protection and services to refugees and asylum seekers, but no law allows the government to grant asylum or refugee status.",3
angola,The president appoints Supreme Court judges to life terms without legislative input. Corruption and political pressure from the MPLA contribute to the judiciary’s general inefficacy and undermine its independence.,1,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are poorly upheld. Many defendants are unable to afford legal counsel, and the state largely fails to provide qualified legal aid to those who need it. Arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detention remain problems. Due process violations have been reported in recent cases involving political activists who seek autonomy or independence for the provinces of Cabinda and Lunda Norte.",1,"Security forces enjoy impunity for violent acts, including torture and extrajudicial killings committed against detainees, activists, protesters, and others. Angolan prisons are reported to be overcrowded, unhygienic, lacking in necessities, and plagued by sexual abuse. According to government statistics, violent crime, including robberies, assaults, and homicides, has increased in Luanda in recent years.The low-level separatist insurgency in Cabinda continues to pose a security threat. The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) claims to have engaged in guerrilla activity against Angolan soldiers, but the government typically does not confirm these claims.",1,"Women face discrimination in the workplace that makes it difficult for them to rise to senior positions. There have been reports of abuse of women and children who are accused of practicing witchcraft.In 2019 the parliament decriminalized same-sex sexual relations and banned discrimination based on sexual orientation, though enforcement is reportedly inadequate. There are no specific protections against bias based on gender identity.Seminomadic Khoi and San tribes in the country’s southern provinces have often suffered from neglect by the government and a lack of access to services, particularly in the context of prolonged droughts and the COVID-19 pandemic.Security forces allegedly harass and abuse immigrant communities, and the government has failed to adequately protect refugees and asylum seekers. UN representatives expressed concern about the forced expulsion of Congolese migrants in 2020, suggesting that it violated international directives on the treatment of refugees.",2
antigua-and-barbuda,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, which is generally respected by the government. In 2018, voters rejected in a referendum the adoption of the Caribbean Court of Justice as their highest appellate court. Thus, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, based in London, retains that role.In recent years, the courts have increasingly asserted independence from the ABLP government, with the support of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court.",4,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are mostly upheld. However, prisoners on remand often remain in jail for an average of three to four years before their cases are heard.",3,"Residents of Antigua and Barbuda do not face any significant security threats. However, in 2021 the number of homicides increased dramatically, with 16 homicides compared to 9 in 2020. Ten homicides were recorded in 2022. Gun-related crimes have also increased in recent years.Prisons are severely overcrowded, and conditions within them are poor. The occupancy rate as of September 2022 was 155 percent.",4,"The 2005 Equal Opportunity Act bars discrimination based on race, gender, class, political affinity, or place of origin. There are no specific laws prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities. Mental health services require improvement and people with physical disabilities are stigmatized and underemployed. Societal norms discourage participation of women in some sectors of the economy, and few women hold leadership positions in businesses. In July 2022, the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court ruled that elements of the country’s Sexual Offences Act were unconstitutional, effectively decriminalizing same-sex sexual relations. The court found that certain sections went against a person’s “right to liberty, protection of the law, freedom of expression, protection of personal property, and protection from discrimination on the basis of sex.” The court also held that a constitutional provision prohibiting sex discrimination also prohibits discrimination based on “gender identity, sexual character, and sexual orientation.” The court further ruled that “persons” must replace “a male person and a female person” in sections of the act defining intercourse.",3
argentina,"The Supreme Court is relatively independent and has resisted executive overreach. However, lower and province-level courts have close ties with political actors and engage in corrupt practices. Leaders of the ruling coalition frequently attack judicial rulings and accuse the courts of ideological bias. President Fernández continued to accuse the judiciary of political bias in 2022, including in December, after the Supreme Court effectively reversed a 2020 decree that had substantially cut the percentage of federal funds allocated to the opposition-led city of Buenos Aires. The president initially said he would not comply with the ruling, which restored funding to the capital city, but later agreed to accept it. After taking office, President Fernández and Vice President Fernández de Kirchner proposed legal reforms that, if enacted, could diminish judicial independence. The government has also tried to limit the independence of the body that names and removes judges.Numerous vacancies and interim appointments hinder the autonomy of the judiciary: one seat on the 5-member Supreme Court has been vacant since late 2021, the role of national ombudsperson has remained vacant for 13 years, and the position of chief prosecutor has been filled on a temporary basis since 2017.",2,"The right to due process is constitutionally protected and generally upheld. However, security officers and some judges are suspected of maintaining criminal ties. Prisons are overcrowded and inmates live in unsuitable conditions. Pretrial detainees represented 54 percent of the country’s prison population as of December 2022.In September, the attorney general’s office reported that a total of 1,088 convictions for crimes committed during the 1976–83 dictatorship had been attained since 2006.",3,"Argentina’s homicide rate is low compared to other Latin American countries, but violence from criminal groups and the security forces remains a serious issue. International criminal organizations use Argentina as an operational base and a transit route; the country’s northern and central regions are particularly affected. Drug-related violence has increased in recent years, especially in the port city of Rosario.Police misconduct, torture, and brutality against detainees is endemic. Arbitrary arrests and abuses by police are rarely punished in the courts, and police officers commonly collude with drug traffickers. In recent years, there have been violent clashes between security forces and Indigenous Mapuche activists in Argentina’s Patagonia region, as well as repeated confrontations between local residents and activists. Some activists have used violence to seize and occupy land.",2,"Argentina has robust antidiscrimination laws, but enforcement is uneven. Indigenous peoples, approximately 2.4 percent of the population, face government neglect, disproportionate levels of poverty, and poor access to services. Displays of xenophobia against migrants and race-based discrimination are common. Women enjoy legal equality, but continue to face economic discrimination and gender-based wage gaps.Argentina’s LGBT+ population enjoys full legal rights, including marriage, adoption, and the right to serve in the military. However, LGBT+ people do face some degree of societal discrimination, and occasionally, serious violence.",3
armenia,"The courts face systemic political influence, and judicial institutions are undermined by corruption. Judges reportedly feel pressure to work with prosecutors to convict defendants, and acquittal rates are extremely low. The government published a five-year judicial-reform strategy in 2019; reforms continued to be enacted in 2022, though progress has been slow.In July 2022, the acting head of Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) resigned after a recording leaked in which he threatened then-head of the SJC with criminal charges if the latter refused to resign. In October, to new SJC members were elected by the ruling faction, including a former minister of justice who had also been a member of the ruling party. The election was viewed as politically motivated.",1,"Authorities apply the law selectively, and due process is not guaranteed in civil or criminal cases. Lengthy pretrial detention remains a problem, and the Armenian judiciary is largely distrusted by the public.The raft of corruption investigations aimed at HHK elites and allies have prompted concerns about the ability of the country’s judicial and investigative mechanisms to ensure fair application of the law.",1,"Reports of police abuse of detainees and poor conditions in prisons persist. After the change in government in 2018, law enforcement agencies renewed dormant investigations into past cases of physical violence by police. Conditions in areas adjacent to Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian-majority territory that previously gained de facto independence from Azerbaijan in 1994, have declined following the 2020 military conflict in the region. Civilians in the region remain at risk of experiencing physical violence. In September 2022, Azerbaijani military forces entered Armenian territory. The escalation of the ongoing military conflict killed over 200 and injured more than 293 Armenian soldiers. Three civilians were killed, and 20 soldiers were taken as prisoners of war. Official reports included credible evidence that Azerbaijani troops had committed war crimes. Civilian settlements and buildings Syunik, Gegharkunik and Vayots Dzor provinces were also targeted, causing significant damage and displacing thousands of civilians. While active hostilities lasted two days, the subsequent ceasefire has been regularly violated. Dozens of Armenian prisoners of war reportedly remained in Azerbaijani custody in 2022. Some were reportedly tortured while in detention.",1,"Women reportedly face discrimination in employment and education, despite legal protections. Although same-sex sexual activity was decriminalized in 2003, LGBT+ people continue to face violence and mistreatment at the hands of police and civilians. In 2022, several cases of attacks on trans women and public calls for violence against LGBT+ people were reported.Under the new criminal code implemented in 2022, individuals who commit crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity may be held criminally liable.",2
australia,"The Australian judiciary is generally independent, although a  lengthy investigation in 2019 by independent media outlet Crikey revealed that the Liberal-National government consciously worked to install individuals affiliated with the Liberal Party—including former candidates, donors, and party members—to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), a body that reviews the merits of administrative decisions by government agencies. Just prior to the 2022 election, the Morrison government extended the terms of a number of Liberal Party–affiliated members of the AAT for periods of up to seven years, even though many of these members had over a year left in their existing terms. The Albanese government announced in December 2022 that the AAT would be abolished and replaced by a new merits review body in 2023.	The judiciary, particularly in the higher-level courts, tends to lack diversity among its members, and many appointed judges come from prominent legal families.",4,"The right to due process is generally respected. Defendants and detainees are presumed innocent until proven guilty and can only be held for 24 hours without being charged for a crime, with exceptions for terrorism cases.People living in rural areas, and in particular Aboriginal people, face significant barriers to accessing the justice system. Judges, lawyers, and prosecutors must be flown into remote communities, providing little time to prepare cases or be briefed by clients. Courtrooms are often in ad hoc, repurposed buildings, and lengthy case dockets are a prominent issue. Judges traveling these circuits work large caseloads due to understaffing and underfunding, which could impact their health and their court decisions. Significant case backlogs cause individuals to wait years for their cases to be heard, which can place some, like those who have experienced domestic violence, in further danger.Authorities shifted court proceedings to be held online during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to increased availability of court and registry services and resources. The greater flexibility offered by virtual hearings and services has, to a degree, increased access to the justice system in rural areas.",4,"Australia provides protection from the illegitimate use of force, and Australians have means to seek redress for harm. Prison conditions mostly meet international standards. However, conditions at numerous juvenile detention centers are substandard. Some children have instead been detained in adult prisons. In 2019, an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) investigative program reported on the practice of placing minors in “watch houses,” maximum security facilities usually reserved for violent adult offenders.",4,"First Nations Australians continue to lag behind other groups in key social and economic indicators; suffer higher rates of incarceration; and report routine mistreatment by police and prison officials. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are placed in detention at a rate 22 times higher than that of non-Aboriginal children. Additionally, people with disabilities make up almost one-third of the prison population, and face harassment and violence in prisons.Men and women have the same legal rights, and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited. In practice, women and LGBT+ people experience employment discrimination and harassment. Religious exemptions within the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 allow for the expulsion of students and dismissal of teachers on the basis of their sexual orientation, although these exemptions are rarely invoked. Australia’s harsh asylum and immigration policies continued to be enforced in 2022. The government announced in October 2021 that it would cease detaining asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea (PNG) by December, transferring the refugees there either to its other offshore detention facility in Nauru—which is characterized by poor living conditions, inadequate safety for women and children, and a lack of sufficient healthcare and education services—or to the Papuan government. As of September 2022, approximately 111 refugees were in detention on Nauru. Asylum seekers can wait years for their applications to be processed; in one severe case, a man seeking asylum from Sri Lanka who fled to Australia in 2009 was still being held in immigration detention through at least the end of 2020. The Albanese government had indicated in its election campaigning that it would grant eligible refugees permanent visa status, and abolish Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) and Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (SHEVs), which expired after three years and five years, respectively. In December 2022, the Albanese government announced that in early 2023, 19,000 refugees would be transitioned to permanent protection visas, granting them rights to social security and reunion with family members.",3
austria,"The judiciary is independent, and is generally held in high regard among Austrians. The Constitutional Court examines the compatibility of legislation with the constitution without political influence or interference. Austrian judges are appointed by the executive instead of a politically independent body, which the CoE has criticized as an insufficient separation of the state government from the judiciary. In recent years, ÖVP officials have drawn criticism for allegedly attempting to obstruct judicial investigations into corruption allegations involving ÖVP politicians.",4,"Due process generally prevails in civil and criminal matters. However, scandals involving Austria’s intelligence apparatus in recent years raised concerns about the potential politicization of the justice system, and respect for due process.",4,"People in Austria are generally free from the illegitimate use of physical force, war, and insurgencies. However, terrorist threats are a concern, and counterterrorism agencies have been found to “lack sufficient capacity” to adequately address existing risks. The number of right-wing extremist crimes reported in Austria rose sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking in 2021 with more than 1,000 such crimes reported. In April 2022, security forces seized Nazi memorabilia and illegal weapons stockpiles from far-right groups while conducting raids across the country.Conditions in prisons generally meet high European standards.",4,"Some groups face difficulty exercising their human rights before the law. Strong rhetoric has been directed against refugees and migrants in recent years. Some asylum seekers can be deported while appeals are pending. In recent years, international organizations have criticized the Austrian asylum system for failing to meet international standards. Continuing deportations during the COVID-19 pandemic and, in 2022, ÖVP attempts to exclude asylum seekers from receiving certain forms of state aid have led to conflict between the coalition partners.LGBT+ people face some societal discrimination. Although hate crime legislation prohibits incitement based on sexual orientation, no law prohibits service providers from denying services on that basis. In May 2022, the government amended blood donation regulations, removing restrictions that had previously prevented gay and bisexual men from donating blood.Despite some improvement, gender equality remains an issue in Austria. According to Eurostat, Austria’s gender wage gap of nearly 19 percent is among the largest in the EU.Several members of Austria’s armed forces have faced disciplinary proceedings and criminal charges in recent years for allegedly engaging in far-right extremist activities. In late 2022, government officials promised to pursue legal reforms mandating the automatic dismissal of any public employee convicted of violating the ban on the use of Nazi symbols.",3
azerbaijan,"The judiciary is corrupt and subservient to the executive. Judges are appointed by the parliament on the proposal of the president. The courts’ lack of political independence is especially evident in the many trumped-up or otherwise flawed cases brought against opposition figures, activists, and critical journalists.",0,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are not upheld. Arbitrary arrest and detention are common, and detainees are often held for long periods before trial. Political detainees have reported restricted access to legal counsel, fabrication and withholding of evidence, and physical abuse to extract confessions.Although nominally independent, the Azerbaijani Bar Association (AVK) acts on the orders of the Ministry of Justice and is complicit in the harassment of human rights lawyers. Legal amendments that took effect in 2018 stipulated that only AVK members could represent clients in court. Since then, the association has disbarred, suspended, or threatened most of the country’s active human rights lawyers for speaking to the media about violations of their clients’ rights. In nearly all disciplinary cases, the courts have upheld AVK decisions without a thorough assessment or public justification.",0,"International observers have consistently concluded that both torture and impunity for the perpetrators of such abuse are endemic in the Azerbaijani criminal justice system. Police regularly administer beatings during arrest or while breaking up protests. Prison conditions are substandard. Medical care is generally inadequate, and overcrowding is common. Azerbaijanis were affected by armed conflict with Armenia during 2020. The two countries engaged in a full-scale conflict over control of Nagorno-Karabakh that September. The conflict ended that November after a Russian-brokered cease-fire was agreed; under its terms, Azerbaijan would retain control of parts of Nagorno-Karabakh gained during the fighting, along with adjacent land held by Armenia. Baku reported that approximately 2,900 soldiers died in the fighting, while at least 146 civilians on both sides were killed. The conflict was marked by reported acts of mistreatment, desecration, and vandalism. Azerbaijani forces have been accused of physically abusing Armenian prisoners of war (POWs). Military clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia continued during 2022. In September, Azerbaijani military forces entered Armenian territory. The escalation of the ongoing military conflict reportedly resulted in the deaths of nearly 100 Azerbaijani soldiers and over 200 Armenian soldiers. Active fighting took place over a two-day period, though the subsequent cease-fire has been regularly violated. Official reports included credible evidence that Azerbaijani troops had committed war crimes.",0,"Members of ethnic minority groups have complained of discrimination in areas including education, employment, and housing. Women are subject to discrimination in employment, including both de facto bias and formal exclusion from certain types of work under the labor code.While IDPs from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that ended in 1994 are entitled to special assistance, they face severe infringements on their economic and social rights and freedom of movement. Many are housed in dormitories or substandard housing and are unable to change their place of residence, which is often located out of range of sources of employment or adequate medical care.Although same-sex sexual activity is legal, LGBT+ people experience societal discrimination and risk harassment by the police. In 2017, police fined or detained dozens of people for weeks in a coordinated crackdown that led many LGBT+ residents to flee the country. In recent years, local and international NGOs have called on the authorities to investigate anti-LGBT+ attacks and take measures to protect LGBT+ individuals. In February 2022, openly gay LGBT+ activist Avaz Shikhmammadov—known as Avaz Hafizli—was murdered by his cousin, Amrulla Gulaliyev, who confessed to killing Hafizli because of his sexual orientation. Gulaliyev was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison in July. Activists noted that Hafizli’s murder was not prosecuted as a hate crime.",0
bahamas,"The judicial system is headed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, with the additional right of appeal to the London-based Privy Council under certain circumstances.The Bahamian judiciary is independent. In 2021, the Bahamas Bar Association called for legislation to better codify judicial independence. The Inter-American Development Bank has suggested separating the public prosecutor and attorney general’s offices to ensure independence.",4,"Due process in civil and criminal matters generally prevails. However, the government only appoints counsel to defendants in capital cases, leaving some people without legal representation.",3,"Homicide and violent crime rates in The Bahamas remain among the highest in the Caribbean. In August 2022, Police Commissioner Clayton Fernander said there were 85 murders over the year to date, a 21 percent increase over the same period in 2021. However, state security agents generally do not engage in the illegal use of force against civilians, and the population is not threatened by large-scale violence or insurgencies. Prison conditions, meanwhile, are poor.",4,"The constitution does not prohibit discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation. LGBT+ people continue to report discrimination in employment and housing. LGBT+ advocates celebrated the country’s third annual Pride week in October 2022.Harsh immigration policies enacted in 2014 target Haitian-Bahamians and Haitian migrants, requiring them to carry a passport and residency permits. The government prioritizes Bahamian citizens for hiring, land grants, and shelter in hurricane relief centers, and has pursued removal of shantytowns that primarily house migrants.",2
bahrain,"The king appoints all judges and heads the Supreme Judicial Council, which administers the courts and proposes judicial nominees. The courts are subject to government pressure in practice. The country’s judicial system is seen as corrupt and biased in favor of the ruling family and its allies, particularly in politically sensitive cases.",0,"Due process is particularly problematic in politically sensitive cases. Law enforcement officers reportedly violate due process during arrests and detention, in part by obstructing detainees’ access to attorneys. Detainees are sometimes held incommunicado. Judicial proceedings often put defendants at a disadvantage, with judges denying bail requests or restricting defense attorneys’ attendance or arguments without explanation. Prominent defense lawyers who represent dissidents have themselves been prosecuted on various charges. A 2017 constitutional amendment permits military trials for civilians in security-related cases, further weakening due process rights.In September 2022, a report from the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights found that there were 4,500 political activists currently in prison in Bahrain; it also concluded that Bahraini authorities had arrested some 15,000 people for their political views since 2011. A 2017 law allows prisoners to complete their sentences via alternative means, such as home detention and monitoring. Some political prisoners have been conditionally released under this provision.",1,"Torture is criminalized, but detainees frequently report mistreatment by security forces and prison officials, who are rarely held accountable. The Interior Ministry ombudsman’s office has failed to provide a meaningful check on such impunity. The Justice Ministry’s Special Investigation Unit is also regarded as largely ineffective and lacking in independence, but it continued to examine cases of alleged ill-treatment and torture in 2022. In April, a criminal court sentenced three members of the security forces to three years in prison for physically assaulting two inmates.Political prisoners have alleged denial of medical care and religious discrimination against Shiite inmates. Several reports of medical negligence emerged in 2022, particularly for political prisoners in Jau Prison, where there was apparently a tuberculosis outbreak. Among other prominent cases during the year, Amnesty International highlighted the conditions faced by human rights defenders Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who was at risk of losing his vision due to lack of medical care, and Abduljalil al-Singace, who had been on hunger strike since 2021 and was being denied some of his medication. Both had been in prison since 2011. A moratorium on executions ended in 2017, though no prisoners have been executed since 2019. UN special rapporteurs and experts have raised concerns that individuals sentenced to death were forced to confess under torture, among other flaws in their cases. Bangladeshi workers are heavily represented among this group; in 2021, the NGO Reprieve reported that eight of the 13 foreigners who received death sentences between 2011 and 2020 were Bangladeshi. Police have sometimes been targeted in small bombings and armed attacks in recent years, though no major incidents were reported in 2022.",0,"Women enjoy legal equality on some issues, and gender-based discrimination in employment is prohibited, but discrimination is common in practice.

Shiites of both Arab and Persian ethnicity face de facto discrimination in matters including employment. They are largely excluded from the security forces, except when serving as unarmed community police officers. The government does not publish socioeconomic data that are broken down by religious sect.

Discrimination based on sexual orientation is common. The law does not provide protections against such bias, though same-sex sexual activity is not criminalized for those aged 21 and older. Public displays of same-sex affection could fall afoul of public decency laws.

Bahrain is not a signatory to the 1951 refugee convention and does not recognize refugee status.",0
bangladesh,"Politicization of and pressure against the judiciary persists. The Ministry of Law controls promotions, postings, and transfers of subordinate court judges. Judges face political pressure over their rulings and judicial appointments at all levels are highly politicized.In 2017, Supreme Court chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha retired and fled Bangladesh, saying he was threatened over rulings against the government. In late 2021, he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years’ imprisonment on corruption charges his supporters called politically motivated.",1,"Individuals’ ability to access the justice system is compromised by endemic corruption within the courts and severe case backlogs. Pretrial detention is often lengthy, and many defendants lack counsel. Suspects are routinely subject to arbitrary arrest and detention, demands for bribes, and physical abuse by police. Criminal cases against AL activists are regularly withdrawn on the grounds of “political consideration,” undermining the judicial process and entrenching a culture of impunity.The 1974 Special Powers Act permits arbitrary detention without charge, and the criminal procedure code allows detention without a warrant. A 2009 counterterrorism law includes a broad definition of terrorism and generally does not meet international standards. Concerns have repeatedly been raised that the International Crimes Tribunal’s procedures and verdicts do not meet international standards on issues such as victim and witness protection, the presumption of innocence, defendant access to counsel, and the right to bail. The tribunal has regularly imposed death sentences in recent years.",1,"Security forces have faced persistent accusations of extrajudicial killings, abductions and other human rights abuses, including during operations to counter the drug trade, organized crime, and terrorism. In late 2021, the US government placed sanctions on several leaders of the RAB. These sanctions appeared to curtail extrajudicial killings in 2022. Nevertheless, security agencies continue to commit human rights abuses including enforced disappearances, the use of secret prisons, arbitrary arrests, and torture. While terrorist activity from Islamic militants has remained low since the 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack, there is ongoing concern that the Taliban’s 2021 overthrow of Afghanistan’s elected government could inspire militant activity in Bangladesh.",2,"Members of ethnic and religious minority communities and other historically marginalized groups face some legal discrimination, as well as harassment and violations of their rights in practice. Over a million ethnic Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar have entered Bangladesh since the 1990s, with a recent influx occurring in 2017. The vast majority do not have official refugee status and have limited access to health care, employment, and education. Repatriation efforts have failed, and the Bangladeshi government has implemented punitive policies in the camps including periodically disrupting mobile service and erecting barbed wire fencing. The government began to shut unsanctioned schools in late 2021.In 2020, authorities began transferring refugees to the flood-prone island of Bhasan Char, which has a refugee population of 30,000 as of August 2022. The government plans to resettle at least 100,000 there. Refugee camps on the mainland are affected by gang-related violence and other forms of lawlessness. In October, two Rohingya community leaders were murdered in a refugee camp; authorities blamed the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a Myanmar insurgent group. Refugees continue to flee Bangladesh on dangerous sea routes; the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported that 2,400 attempted to flee by sea in 2022, five times as many as in 2021.A criminal ban on same-sex relations is rarely enforced, but societal discrimination remains the norm, and LGBT+ individuals are regularly attacked. A number of LGBT+ individuals remain in exile after Islamist militants murdered LGBT+ activist Xulhaz Mannan in 2016. Some legal recognition is available for transgender people, though they face severe discrimination in practice.Women face social discrimination. Despite rising participation in the labor market, women still constitute less than 50 percent of the labor force. Women suffer sexual harassment and other forms of abuse in the workplace. Indigenous people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), religious and linguistic minorities, and other ethnic groups remain subject to physical attacks, property destruction, land grabs by Bengali settlers, occasional abuses by security forces, and social discrimination.",1

While the Mottley administration has appointed new judges, a case backlog persists.",4,"Barbados is free from war. However, complaints that the Barbados Police Force physically abuses suspects have been reported in recent years. Amid worsening gang violence, 43 homicides were reported in 2022, up from 32 in 2021.	The government has taken some steps to address prison overcrowding and abuse. In 2019, the government repealed the mandatory death penalty in cases of murder; the CCJ had ruled that practice unconstitutional in 2018. Capital punishment remains on the statute book, though the last execution was in 1984 and the last sentence in 2016. However, a number of prisoners facing the death sentence still awaited resentencing in 2022.",3,"Women make up half of the country’s workforce, although they earn less than men for comparable work.

belarus,"Courts are entirely subservient to President Lukashenka, who appoints Supreme Court justices with the approval of the rubber-stamp parliament.",0,"The right to a fair trial is not respected and often flatly dismissed in cases with political overtones. In a departure from international norms, the power to extend pretrial detention lies with a prosecutor rather than a judge. The absence of independent oversight allows police to routinely violate legal procedures. The government regularly attacks attorneys, who often are the only connection between imprisoned activists and their families and society.Since the 2020 presidential campaign, arbitrary arrests, police brutality and torture, and the denial of due process have continued with impunity. Lawyers are often denied the right to meet with their defendants. Many lawyers defending political prisoners were disbarred or arrested. In July 2022, Lukashenka enacted a law permitting the authorities to conduct trials in absentia for crimes that “entail a threat to national security.”",0,"Law enforcement agencies have broad powers to employ physical force against suspects, who have little opportunity for recourse if they are abused. Human rights groups continue to document instances of beatings, torture, and intimidation during detention. During and after the presidential election period in 2020 and throughout 2021, detained peaceful prodemocracy protesters experienced cruel and dehumanizing treatment during their arrests, while being transported to detention centers and when incarcerated. Excessive force has been used to extract confessions from detainees. Extracted confessions, where detainees appear beaten, distressed, and humiliated, have been recorded, published, and distributed by state agencies, violating the principle of human dignity and the right to a fair trial.Belarus served as a staging ground for Russian military forces before and during their invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and President Lukashenka continued to allow Russian troops to operate from Belarusian territory through year’s end. Belarusian dissidents have resisted the Russian military presence, with so-called railway partisans notably attacking Belarusian rail infrastructure; their sabotage prevented the transit of Russian military forces and equipment to Ukraine. Authorities quickly labeled the railway partisans as “terrorists,” and used excessive force to detain several people for their alleged participation. In May, Lukashenka enacted new legislation to make such attacks punishable by death; as of December, several people had been convicted of engaging in rail sabotage and received lengthy prison sentences.",0,"Authorities have sought to increase the dominance of the Russian language. Official usage of Belarusian remains rare. The UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognizes Belarusian as “vulnerable.” Since Lukashenka became president, the share of first graders who study in Belarusian fell from 40 to under 10 percent as of 2019. During 2022, authorities continued to restrict the use of the Belarusian language, including by refusing to provide Belarusian-language materials to voters before or during the constitutional referendum in February. The authorities also arbitrarily shut down at least one publishing house specializing in Belarusian-language publications and designated numerous Belarusian-language books and newspapers as “extremist materials” during the year.Women are prohibited from entering 181 different occupations, and societal norms in much of the country hold that women should be mothers or housewives. However, Tsikhanouskaya’s mass support in the prodemocracy movement has become a slight counter to long-standing gender roles.LGBT+ people face widespread societal discrimination, and law enforcement authorities are reluctant to investigate and prosecute attacks against them.In 2021, Belarusian authorities began deliberately facilitating the passage of asylum seekers and migrants—most of them from Iraq—through Belarus to the borders of the EU. Polish and Belarusian authorities used tear gas and water cannons against the migrants, who were left in freezing temperatures without adequate shelter, supplies, and assistance. Approximately 2,000 asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants were stranded in Belarus by the end of 2021, and over 1,000 people chose to return home voluntarily as of the end of that year. Belarusian authorities continued to push asylum seekers and migrants to cross the EU border throughout 2022, though individuals have also left via repatriation flights; over 3,800 Iraqis were repatriated according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in its November 2021–May 2022 report.",0
belgium,"The judiciary is independent by law and in practice, and court rulings are duly enforced by other state entities.",4,"The judicial process generally guarantees a fair trial, and the authorities typically observe safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. Extraordinary security measures adopted in the period surrounding terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016 have eased significantly in the years since, though a 2017 legal change increased the maximum length of detention in police custody without a judicial order from 24 to 48 hours.",4,"Although conditions in prisons and detention centers meet most international standards, the facilities continue to suffer from overcrowding and other problematic living conditions.Drug trafficking and related violence is a problem. In September 2022, four people were arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap Belgium’s justice minister, who police believe was targeted due to his efforts to crack down on international drug trafficking. Investigations into the incident remained ongoing at year’s end. According to the Belgian Coordination Body for Threat Analysis (OCAM), the threat from far-right extremism has increased in recent years. In September 2022, a series of antiterror police raids targeting suspected right-wing extremists were conducted across the country. One man was shot and killed during a raid after he allegedly opened fire on the police; the Antwerp prosecutor’s office later opened an investigation into the incident.",4,"Antidiscrimination legislation prohibits bias and acts of hatred and incitement based on categories including gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, and sexual orientation. Nevertheless, some groups, including immigrants, Belgians of African descent, and Romany residents, continue to face a degree of discrimination in practice.In 2019, UN experts stated that racial discrimination is institutionally endemic in Belgium and called for recognition of the country’s history of human rights abuses during its colonial rule over what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Following debates prompted by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, King Philippe expressed regrets over Belgian colonial rule. Although politicians have gradually become aware of the need for critical discussion about the country’s past, the rising influence of hard-right nationalist parties in Flanders has been accompanied by racism and xenophobia. Despite robust legal protections for the rights of LGBT+ people, LGBT+ individuals sometimes face instances of violence and discrimination in practice.",3
belize,"The judiciary is generally independent, despite inadequate resources and periodic attempts by political and business interests to interfere with its composition. After coming to power in 2020, the PUP government pledged to provide greater resources to the judiciary; however, as of October 2022, extra resources have not been forthcoming.In April 2021, the parliament passed new legislation requiring Supreme Court and Court of Appeal judges to deliver written judgments within six months or face dismissal. In October 2022, the parliament passed the Senior Courts Bill, which will reform the country’s judicial system, and the 12th Constitutional Amendment, which will allow the Senior Courts Bill to be enacted. According to the new legislation, the Supreme Court will be replaced with a new High Court, which, with the Court of Appeal, will comprise a new Senior Court system. The Senior Courts Bill was signed into law in November.",4,"Detainees and defendants are guaranteed a range of legal rights, which are mostly respected in practice. However, police have reportedly detained suspects without charge for longer than is permitted by the law and have used the threat of extended detention to intimidate suspects. Judicial delays and a large backlog of cases contribute to lengthy trials and other procedures, with many defendants spending years in pretrial detention.",3,"Belize is free from major threats to physical security, such as war and insurgencies, but the long-running border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved. Tensions have lessened in recent years, but there are occasional incidents. Belize remains among the countries with the highest per capita murder rates in the world. According to government statistics, in 2022, there were 113 homicides, compared to 125 in 2021. Much of the violence is localized around the south side of Belize City.Cases of police brutality continue to be reported. In one case in December 2022, police used excessive force while arresting a man accused of smoking marijuana in public. The man, who had hemophilia, later died from injuries allegedly sustained from severe beatings during his arrest and while in police custody.",3,"The constitution and laws protect against many forms of discrimination, but there are no specific provisions addressing sexual orientation or gender identity. Discrimination against LGBT+ people persists. In 2016, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the criminal code that outlawed same-sex sexual activity. In December 2019, the Court of Appeal upheld the unconstitutionality of the criminal code article and confirmed that constitutional freedom of expression and antidiscrimination protections include sexual orientation. Women face employment discrimination and are less likely than men to hold managerial positions. However, the government has actively pursued programs aimed at encouraging gender equality and protecting women’s rights.Migration into Belize has increased significantly in recent years, and government estimates suggest that up to 15 percent of the country’s population is without official documentation. Migrants face legal and social challenges to integration into Belizean society, and some immigrants have faced detention in Belize Central Prison for entering the country illegally. In August 2022, an amnesty program began to allow undocumented immigrants to gain permanent residency under certain conditions. The application process was originally set to run until November 2022, but that month, the government extended the program to February 2023.No separate legal system or laws specifically protect Indigenous people.",3
benin,"Although the judiciary has demonstrated some independence, the courts are susceptible to corruption. Judges are not nominated or promoted transparently.Judicial independence was undermined when President Talon’s personal lawyer, Joseph Djogbénou, was named Constitutional Court president in 2018. The court has since issued a number of decisions that favor the government, intensifying concerns about its autonomy. Djogbénou stepped down in July 2022 to take over leadership of the progovernment Progressive Union party.CRIET also lacks independence. Judges were appointed by decree in 2018, in lieu of a transparent confirmation process. A CRIET judge resigned and fled the country in 2021, reporting that the court is used to prosecute Talon’s political opponents.",2,"Due process usually prevails in criminal and civil matters. However, judicial inefficiency, corruption, and a shortage of attorneys in the north inhibit the right to a fair trial. Lack of resources contributes to often lengthy pretrial detentions. Arbitrary arrests and detentions occasionally occur, sometimes with extreme sentencing, particularly in the CRIET.During the 2021 presidential election period, reports suggest that large numbers of opposition leaders and activists were arrested by the authorities. Reckya Madougou—a prominent prodemocracy campaigner, former justice minister, and presidential candidate—was arrested and detained on spurious terrorism charges in March 2021 and, despite a lack of evidence, sentenced to 20 years in prison that December. In November 2022, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called for Madougou’s release after ruling that her 2021 arrest was devoid of legal basis and that her detention is arbitrary.According to international rights NGO Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF), hundreds of nonviolent individuals were arrested for politically motivated reasons in 2021.",2,"The population is free from war and other major physical threats, though the threat of terrorism is growing in the north. Approximately 20 people were killed in terrorist attacks during 2022, including at least 12 soldiers. Prison conditions are harsh. Prisoners face overcrowding, lack of access to food and water, and occasional physical abuse. Police brutality remains a problem, including beatings and torture of suspects. Superiors often shield perpetrators from prosecution.",3,"Relations among Benin’s ethnic groups are generally amicable, despite recent political tensions. Minority ethnic groups have typically been represented in government agencies, the civil service, and the armed forces. The constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, and disability, but not sexual orientation. The 1996 penal code imposes a higher age of consent for same-sex sexual activity (21) than for heterosexual activity (13). LGBT+ people face social stigma and discrimination in practice.

bolivia,"Bolivia stands as the sole country that appoints justices via popular elections. However, judges on the Supreme Court (TSJ), the TCP, and other entities are first nominated through a two-thirds vote in the legislature. For years, this allowed MAS to dominate the candidate selection process, producing a lenient judiciary. The popular election of judges has politicized and factionalized appointments, creating further opportunities for corruption. In October 2022, the head of the Council of Magistrates, the body in charge of regulating the judiciary, resigned after acknowledging that he had collaborated with legislators from the ruling party to confirm the nomination of several judges. In addition to its politicization, the judiciary remains overburdened.The use of the judiciary to prosecute opposition leaders was a common practice during the Morales administration and continued under interim president Áñez’s government, which pressured prosecutors to pursue criminal cases against hundreds of individuals associated with the Morales administration. An arrest warrant for Morales, issued in December 2019, was annulled following the MAS victory in the October 2020 elections. In October 2020, the outgoing legislature approved the indictment of 11 ministers from the interim government, and recommended that interim president Áñez be prosecuted for her role in worsening the election-related violence in 2019. Áñez was arrested on multiple charges in March 2021, including conspiracy, sedition, and terrorism; she remained in preventive detention until June 2022, when she was brought to trial. Áñez was convicted of illegally assuming the presidency in 2019 and sentenced to ten years in prison. The Arce administration has also accused several opposition leaders elected in the March 2021 local elections, including Camacho, of terrorism, conspiracy, and sedition. New charges were brought against Camacho and other civic leaders following antigovernment protests in Santa Cruz in late 2022, including charges of sedition, conspiracy, and terrorism. Camacho was arrested in December on terrorism charges and remained in pretrial detention at year’s end.The August 2021 GIEI report on the 2019 political crisis found that a lack of independence, transparency, and objectivity in the exercise of criminal prosecutions—often used against political opponents—constitutes a structural and endemic problem of the Bolivian judiciary.",1,"Many people have difficulty accessing the justice system because they lack resources to travel to courts and other relevant offices. In criminal matters, people accused of committing crimes can go years before they have a formal trial; interim president Áñez, who was arrested in March 2021, remained in preventive detention for more than a year before her June 2022 trial. Police are poorly paid and receive inadequate training, and corruption within the police force remains a problem. In September 2022, a preliminary IACHR report revealed that in 2009, while Morales was president, Bolivian security forces detained, tortured, and extrajudicially executed at least three people who allegedly belonged to a terrorist cell that was supporting a separatist movement in the region of Santa Cruz. Others accused of involvement in the movement were illegally held in preventive detention for up to ten years. The 2022 report found the Bolivian government responsible for the human rights abuses stemming from this incident.",1,"Morales supporters and opponents fought violently in several cities following the 2019 elections and Morales’s resignation. Both sympathizers and detractors of Morales had access to explosives, including dynamite, homemade rocket launchers, and Molotov cocktails, and used them against each other and the security forces.

bosnia-and-herzegovina,"The judiciary is formally independent but weak in practice. Dozens of Constitutional Court decisions have been disregarded by political leaders, as has some jurisprudence from the ECtHR. Individual judges are also subject to political pressure, interference, and intimidation regarding the cases before them. The High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HJPC), which appoints judges, has been racked by scandals and is widely perceived as corrupt. The HJPC was among the state institutions from which the RS intended to withdraw, according to Dodik’s October 2021 announcement.The existence of four separate court systems—for BiH, the RS, the Federation, and the self-governing Brčko District—contributes to overall inefficiency. Successive rounds of US sanctions in 2022 targeted, among other things, criminal elements within the Bosnian prosecutor’s chamber and individuals involved in the refusal of the Croat nationalist HDZ BiH to appoint judges to the Federation’s Constitutional Court.",1,"Guarantees of due process are inconsistently upheld, with judges often failing to manage trials effectively and contributing to extensive delays. Access to adequate legal counsel can be contingent on one’s financial standing. Police corruption is a problem and sometimes stems from links to organized crime. Public prosecutors are widely reputed to be corrupt and under political control.The process of prosecuting war crimes in domestic courts has been slow, with political interference and courts’ lack of resources and capacity exacerbating a large backlog of cases. Despite efforts to reinvigorate the process, impunity for war crimes including killings and sexual violence has persisted.In September 2021, the HJPC removed the country’s chief prosecutor, Gordana Tadić, from her post for negligence. She was accused of working to shield individuals presumed to be under the protection of the HDZ BiH from prosecution. US sanctions in 2022 have continued to home in on state prosecutors.",2,"Although overall violent crime rates are low, organized crime is a significant problem, and high-profile incidents in recent years have fueled public frustration with the police and judicial system. Members of vulnerable groups are subject to harassment by police, including migrants transiting through the country. Many prisons are overcrowded or feature other substandard conditions, and detainees face physical abuse by prison authorities. Active land mines dating to the 1990s continue to pose a threat to civilians in rural parts of the country.",2,"Laws guaranteeing equal treatment are unevenly upheld. Discrimination against members of the Romany minority is widespread. People who returned to their homes after being displaced during the war face discrimination in employment and housing in regions where their ethnic group constitutes a minority; Bosniak returnees in the RS face notable discrimination and harassment. Bosniaks and Croats in the RS more generally experience difficulties in accessing social services. Women are legally entitled to full equality with men but encounter discrimination in the workplace in practice. Members of the LGBT+ community face discrimination, harassment, and occasional physical attacks, and authorities often fail to adequately investigate and prosecute crimes against LGBT+ people.Tens of thousands of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers have arrived in the country each year since 2018. While the vast majority travel on to other locations, thousands remain stranded in BiH, most of whom live in squalid camps that lack basic services or protection against the elements. Authorities in the RS have refused to allow any migrant centers, and the burden of care has been thrust almost entirely on a handful of municipalities in the country’s northwest.",2
botswana,"The judiciary is generally independent and free from interference. Judges have ruled against the government in several high-profile cases in recent years.The year 2022 saw a number of organizations, including the Law Society of Botswana (LSB), condemn several acts involving the chief justice. The LSB accused the chief justice of manipulating the allocation of cases involving high-profile disputes in which the executive has a vested interest. The attorney general registered similar concerns. In September, the LSB called for the immediate resignation of the chief justice following accusations that, working together with Minister for State President Kabo Morwaeng, he tried to influence a judge in the a case against parliament member and former cabinet minister Thapelo Matsheka. The chief justice denied interfering.Calls to improve the transparency, impartiality, and public oversight of the selection and appointment processes for judges persist. While the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) advertises vacancies and interviews potential members of the High Court, the appointment process for Court of Appeal judges is relatively nontransparent.",3,"The right to a fair trial is constitutionally protected and generally upheld in practice. However, the judiciary lacks human and financial resources, leading to case backlogs, lengthy pretrial detentions, and the postponement of cases. In February 2022, the chair of the LSB called out a lack of disciplinary actions against judges who failed to deliver timely judgments. Among other things he pointed to the case of a judge who retired without delivering more than 100 pending judgments. A directive was issued to restart the cases at the expense of litigants.In August 2022, Justice Gaolapelwe Ketlogetswe lambasted the government for detaining Matsheka without a warrant or charge for more than the legally permitted 48 hours.Attorneys are provided to defendants in capital cases, but defendants in noncapital cases must pay for their own counsel. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention observed during its July 2022 visit that legal aid was only available in civil proceedings and capital cases. It also raised concern about the automatic and often indefinite detention of irregular migrants. The DISS can arrest suspects without a warrant if agents believe they have committed or will commit a crime.",3,"Although citizens are largely protected from the illegitimate use of force, corporal punishment is sometimes imposed. The law allows for capital punishment. During its July 2022 visit to the country, the UN Committee Against Torture noted inhumane treatment of people on death row. The state does not provide them or their families with details about the date and time of execution, and their bodies are not always given to their families for burial.The DISS has historically been accused of corrupt activity, unlawful arrests, and extrajudicial killings. Instances of police brutality have been reported, and perpetrators are rarely held accountable. Botswana has no human rights body to investigate human rights abuses, but has conferred that function to the Office of the Ombudsman. The penal code does not define torture as a crime. In February 2022, the defense, justice, and security minister was criticized for instructing police at a police conference to “eliminate” suspected criminals.Antipoaching operations have resulted in fatal incidents over the past two decades. In 2018, President Masisi ended an unwritten shoot-to-kill policy originally adopted in at least 2013 to deter wildlife poachers. The poaching ban was revoked altogether in 2019. In January 2022, an inquest found that soldiers who had killed four suspected poachers in November 2020 were not criminally liable.",3,"Customary law, commonly applied in rural areas, often discriminates against women. The Indigenous San people tend to be economically marginalized and lack access to education and other public services. There have been reports of beatings, abuse, and arbitrary arrests of San by police and park rangers.Same-sex relations were criminalized until 2019, when the High Court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal upheld the ruling in November 2021. President Masisi promised to respect the ruling during a historic meeting January 2022 with representatives of the LGBT+ rights group LEGABIBO.Refugees in Botswana have been detained in encampments and have been denied the ability to work and integrate into local communities.",2
brazil,"The judiciary, though largely independent in many parts of the country, is overburdened, inefficient, and often subject to intimidation and other external influences, especially in rural areas. Despite these shortcomings, the country’s progressive constitution has resulted in an active judiciary that often rules in favor of citizens over the state.The Supreme Court serves as an autonomous counterweight to the executive. Tensions remained high in 2022, with Bolsonaro frequently issuing threats against the court. Bolsonaro has maintained an adversarial stance towards Supreme Court justices, especially Alexandre de Moraes, who Bolsonaro accused of favoring Lula in a January 2022 comment. In October, Bolsonaro threatened to pack the Supreme Court with his appointees if reelected.",3,"The judiciary generally upholds the right to a fair trial. However, federal, state, and appellate courts are severely backlogged. Access to justice varies greatly due to income inequality, and the state struggles to provide legal counsel for defendants and prisoners who are unable to afford an attorney. Under a 2017 law, members of the armed forces and military police accused of certain serious crimes against civilians can be tried in military, rather than civilian, courts. In the vast majority of homicides by police, there is no due process.",2,"Brazil has a high homicide rate; 20,100 people were murdered in the first half of 2022, though that figure represented a 5 percent fall from the same period in 2021. The police force remains mired in corruption, and serious police abuses, including extrajudicial killings, continued in 2022. Police officers are rarely prosecuted for abuses, and those charged are almost never convicted. In May 2022, the Violence Monitor—a project of the G1 news site, the Center for the Study of Violence, and the Brazilian Public Security Forum (FBSP)—counted more than 6,100 deaths caused by police in 2021. Some 81.5 percent of the victims whose race was known were Black.Police violence is particularly acute in Rio de Janeiro State. According to the May 2022 Violence Monitor report, police killed 1,356 people there, the most of any state in the country. A raid that took place in Vila Cruzeiro that month resulted in 22 deaths. Police violence is also prevalent in several other states; incidents in the states of Bahia, Goiás, São Paulo, Pará, Paraná, and Rio de Janeiro accounted for over 70 percent of all deaths by police in 2021.Conditions in severely overcrowded prisons are life-threatening, characterized by disease, inadequate food, and deadly gang-related violence. Violence is more likely to affect poor, Black prisoners.Indigenous people are also at physical risk. In its August 2022 report, the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI) counted 176 murders of Indigenous people in 2021, its second-highest figure. CIMI also reported 148 suicides, its highest-ever figure. In July 2022, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights voiced their concern over attacks on Indigenous people and called on the government to better protect them.",1,"While Brazilian society is largely tolerant, some populations are not able to fully exercise their human rights in practice. Just over half of the population identifies as Black or of mixed race. Afro-Brazilians suffer from high rates of poverty and illiteracy, and almost 80 percent of Brazilians living in extreme poverty are Black or mixed race. Victims of violence in Brazil are predominantly young, Black, and poor: According to a July 2022 FBSP report, 77.9 percent of murder victims in 2021 were Black. The FBSP also counted 1,341 femicides in 2021, a 1.7 percent decrease from 2020.In 2019, despite intense pressure from some religious and political leaders, the Supreme Court ruled LGBT+ people are protected under a criminal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of “race, color, ethnicity, religion, and national origin.” However, Brazil reportedly has one of the world’s highest levels of anti-LGBT+ violence. According to a February 2022 report by Grupo Gay da Bahia, an LGBT+ advocacy organization, 276 LGBT+ people were killed in 2021 because of homophobic violence, while another 24 died by suicide. The group’s figures represented an 8 percent increase over 2020.Many Indigenous communities—who comprise about 1 percent of the population—suffer from poverty and lack adequate sanitation and education services. The Indigenous population faces considerable discrimination, and their lands have been subject to increased pressure under Bolsonaro, encouraged by his rhetoric and support for easing environmental laws. The National Indian Foundation, a government agency for Indigenous affairs, was weakened during the Bolsonaro administration.",2
brunei,"Brunei has a dual judicial system of secular and Sharia courts; all senior judges are appointed by the sultan. The courts appear to act independently when handling civil matters, and have yet to be tested in political cases or under the new regulations recently phased in. They have not shown independence in any cases relating to the sultan’s interests, however.",1,"Civil and criminal law is based on English common law and is enforced in secular courts, while Sharia is enforced in Sharia courts. People detained under the Internal Security Act lack due process rights including the presumption of innocence.The country’s controversial Sharia-based penal code was delayed for several years; Brunei introduced the first phase in 2014 but did not fully implement the code, which contains penalties including amputations and death by stoning, until 2019.The government only provides an attorney to indigent defendants in death penalty cases. To address this gap in access to justice, the Law Society of Brunei launched a pilot program for the country’s first legal aid fund in 2018.",2,"Brunei retained the death penalty for crimes including drug trafficking before the new Sharia code was launched. However, no individual has been executed since 1957. Prison conditions generally meet international standards. Sharia-based criminal statutes implemented in 2019 contain more severe penalties for violations including consensual same-sex relations, theft, and adultery; they vary from whippings to amputations and death by stoning. That May, the sultan issued a “de facto moratorium on capital punishment,” but did not issue clarification on the other provisions.",1,"Bruneian citizenship is inherited from citizen fathers. Citizen mothers must complete an application to pass citizenship on to children born to a noncitizen father. Thousands of stateless residents of Brunei, including longtime ethnic Chinese residents, are denied the full rights and benefits granted to citizens. LGBT+ people living in Brunei are subject to severe penalties for same-sex relations under Sharia-based laws. Under regulations introduced in 2019, consensual same-sex acts can be punished by death, or by whipping if the offenders are female.",1
bulgaria,"Bulgaria’s judiciary has benefited from legal and institutional reforms associated with EU membership, but is still prone to politicization. Despite significant legislation formally guaranteeing judicial independence, the members and governing bodies of the judiciary often act in accordance with the ruling majority.A Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is responsible for judicial and prosecutorial appointments and management, with half the members (six judges, four prosecutors, and an investigator) elected by their peers and half by a two-thirds parliamentary majority. Bulgarian legal observers have reported that in practice, requiring a two-thirds majority vote in parliament to appoint SJC members has allowed political parties—including minority parties such as DPS—to exert undue influence over the selection and appointment of the country’s top magistrates. The Supreme Administrative Court has controversially ruled to annul government decisions. One such ruling in 2022 annulled the government decision to return phytosanitary control over a Turkish-Bulgarian border crossing 2022 to a private company.",3,"Constitutional rights to due process are not always upheld. Police have been accused of misconduct, including arbitrary arrests and failure to inform suspects of their rights. The arrest in March 2022 of former prime minister Borissov on suspicion of corruption while in office did not follow the procedural rules and in August was held illegal by a court, reflecting occasional violations of due process in Bulgaria.Public trust in the justice system is low due to its reputed vulnerability to political and outside pressure.The relatively lengthy seven-year mandate granted to the prosecutor general and the lack of effective accountability mechanisms have long been noted as major problems with the prosecutorial office, weakening due process and rule of law in the country. The prosecutor general’s strong influence with regard to career promotion and within the SJC inhibits individuals from voicing and investigating allegations of misconduct within the office.",2,"Although the population faces few acute threats to physical security, police brutality, including abuse of suspects in custody, remains a problem. Overcrowding and violence plague many of Bulgaria’s prisons. Organized crime is still an issue.",3,"Ethnic minorities, particularly the Roma, face discrimination in employment, health care, education, and housing, though the government and NGOs operate a number of programs meant to improve their social integration. Authorities periodically demolish illegally constructed or irregular housing—mostly in areas occupied by Roma—without providing alternative shelter. The Romany minority was also subject to disproportionately severe pandemic-related restrictions throughout 2020.Migrants and asylum seekers have reportedly faced various forms of mistreatment by Bulgarian authorities, including beatings and extortion.Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal, but societal bias against LGBT+ people persists. While anti-LGBT+ violence has been significantly underreported in Bulgaria, and largely goes unaddressed by authorities, there were no registered homophobia-motivated hate crimes in Bulgaria in 2022, and LGBT+ groups note some slowly increasing tolerance toward LGBT+ people. To date, homophobia has not been added to the penal code as an aggravating factor in hate crimes.A gender equality law passed in 2016 was designed to foster equal opportunity for women, but discrimination in employment persists: women are employed less often and paid less than men.",2
burkina-faso,The judiciary is formally independent but has historically been subject to executive influence and corruption. The Constitutional Council in October 2022 officially inaugurated Captain Traoré as president after his military coup the previous month.,2,"Constitutional due-process guarantees are undermined by corruption and the inefficacy of the judiciary and police force. The judicial system is also affected by ongoing insecurity, which has caused the closure of some courts and has limited access to judicial services.In April 2022, former president Blaise Compaoré was found guilty of conspiracy in the 1987 assassination of former president Thomas Sankara and was sentenced to life in prison in absentia. Despite his conviction, in July Compaoré traveled from Côte d’Ivoire, where he had been living, to Ouagadougou at the invitation of then junta-leader Damiba. He was allowed to stay for a few days before returning to Côte d’Ivoire. The high profile visit revealed the limits of the Burkinabè justice system in holding powerful figures to account.",1,"The security environment is affected by Islamic militant groups, bandits, and militias. Traditional leaders, government officials, lawmakers, and civilians are regularly targeted for kidnapping or assassination by militants. Militants target government institutions, like health clinics and schools, restricting access to government services. Children are increasingly being recruited by militants and engage in armed activity. Ongoing violence has prompted significant internal displacement; humanitarian organizations in a joint letter in September 2022 reported that nearly 2 million Burkinabè were internally displaced.Government forces and state-allied militias like the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP) commit extrajudicial violence, particularly against the Fulani ethnic group. Militants, militias, and government forces are believed to orchestrate forced disappearances. Security forces, militias, and civilians faced armed attacks during 2022, causing numerous casualties. Allegations of torture and abuse of suspects in custody by police are common, and prison conditions are poor. Security forces have been accused of forcibly detaining and abusing civilians. Security in the country has deteriorated since the military took power in the first coup of the year in January 2022.",0,"While the constitution outlaws all forms of discrimination, prejudice occurs in practice. Members of the Fulani ethnic group have expressed dissatisfaction over government neglect, discrimination, and abuse, particularly at the hands of security forces and militias. Their treatment has worsened since the military seized power in January 2022 and recruited volunteer militias that have intentionally targeted Fulani people. More than two dozen Fulani civilians were killed, apparently by the VDP, in the town of Nouna in late December. Military rule has also eliminated legal guarantees of protection.LGBT+ people, as well as those living with HIV, routinely experience discrimination, including difficulty accessing health services. While illegal, gender discrimination remains common in employment and education.",1
burundi,"The judiciary is hindered by corruption and a lack of resources and training. The judiciary is generally subservient to the executive, which regularly interferes in the criminal justice system to protect CNDD-FDD and Imbonerakure members and persecute the political opposition. In 2020, the Constitutional Court partially checked the CNDD-FDD’s power by upholding a challenge to the disqualification of an opposition parliamentary candidate. However, it did not entertain a challenge over the conduct of the presidential election, despite evidence of widespread fraud and intimidation. President Ndayishimiye has repeatedly accused the judiciary of corruption and human rights violations. In August 2022, Ndayishimiye dismissed 40 judges accused of corruption and mismanagement. The judges were convicted on corruption-related charges later that month, and were issued sentences ranging from 1 to 30 years in prison as well as fines of up to 3.3 million Burundian francs ($1,640).",0,"The courts, police, and security forces do not operate independently or professionally, and constitutional guarantees of due process are generally not upheld. Arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detention are common. In 2017, the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed by the government. Burundi left the ICC days later, becoming the first country in the world to do so.",0,"The security situation in Burundi remains extremely poor. A 2021 UN CoI report notes that widespread human rights violations persist, including forced disappearance, execution, torture, and arbitrary arrest and detention. The report identified the SNR as the principal perpetrator, though it also noted the involvement of the Imbonerakure and police. According to a July 2022 BHRI report, hundreds of Burundian soldiers and untrained Imbonerakure members were “secretly deployed” to fight the Resistance Movement for the Rule of Law–Tabara, a Burundian armed opposition group located in the DRC, as early as December 2021. Burundian troops officially entered the DRC in August 2022 as part of an EAC mission meant to help the Congolese fight armed groups active in the east of that country. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 258,000 Burundian refugees resided in nearby countries as of December 2022, 48.9 percent of them in Tanzania. The CNDD-FDD apparatus has violently targeted returning refugees on suspicion of opposition sympathies, along with individuals suspected of having ties to Burundian rebels operating in the DRC. The Burundian prison system is overcrowded. In late November 2022, the World Prison Brief reported that although Burundian prisons have an official capacity of approximately 4,290, over 12,000 inmates are imprisoned.",0,"Despite quotas for representation in the National Assembly, the Twa population remains marginalized relative to the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups.

cabo-verde,"The judiciary is independent, though the courts are overburdened, understaffed, and underfunded. During 2022, the courts decreased their case backlog, with 10,160 pending cases remaining in November. The judiciary’s goal was to reduce pending cases by half over the course of four years.",4,"Police and prosecutors generally observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. Defense attorneys are provided to indigent defendants. However, due to the limited capacity of the court system, there are often delays in detainees’ first hearings before a judge, and many cases are dropped because defendants in detention are denied a timely trial.",3,"Law enforcement officials are sometimes accused of using excessive force, but perpetrators are often investigated and punished by oversight bodies. Cabo Verde is generally free of major violence or unrest. Nevertheless, violent crime does occur, and street crime, smuggling, and drug trafficking are perceived as consistent problems. The government sought to increase the capacity of law enforcement during 2022, establishing a municipal police force in Sal and reporting on plans to extend the measure to other municipalities.In 2017, the government permitted the Chinese technology firm Huawei to install surveillance cameras in Praia and three other cities as part of its Safe City project. While observers voiced privacy concerns, the government has maintained its support for the program. In April 2022, the government announced the expansion of the surveillance system to Tarrafal. Prison conditions are poor and often overcrowded, but the government has been working to improve conditions through steps including changes to legislation, the implementation of a social reintegration program for prisoners, the construction of more cells and bathrooms, and the rehabilitation and expansion of existing facilities.",4,"Gender discrimination is prohibited by law, but wage discrimination and unequal access to education persist for women. The country lacks comprehensive antidiscrimination legislation covering all forms of bias. Immigrants, who make up 2.2 percent of the population, often face discriminatory treatment in accessing documents and employment.Same-sex relations are not criminalized, and the law protects against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.

canada,Canada’s judiciary is generally independent.,4,Constitutionally protected due process rights are generally upheld in practice.,4,"The use of solitary confinement for extended periods of time in Canada’s prisons has been controversial. While there have been changes in recent years to solitary confinement laws, an advisory panel report released in May 2021 found that the length of solitary confinement and the frequency of its use had not substantially changed. Despite continued pressure, the federal government has not publicized plans to change solitary confinement laws and procedures.",4,"Governments in Canada have made increasing efforts to enforce equal rights and opportunities for minority groups, although problems persist. Black and Indigenous Canadians remain subject to widespread discrimination, struggle with food insecurity, and have unequal access to education, health care, public services, and employment. While there has been some recent progress on these issues, it has been slow. The federal government’s 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) and its 2019 National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) —which concluded that the history of state discrimination and oppression of Indigenous people amounted to genocide—made several recommendations to improve the lives of Canada’s Indigenous peoples. An analysis that was last updated in July 2022 found that only 13 out of 94 TRC calls to action had been completed. In June, Bill C-29 was introduced in the House of Commons to establish a National Council for Reconciliation that will monitor progress on the completion of the TRC’s calls to action and suggest areas where governments improve their efforts to ensure equal rights and justice for First Nations people. Though the government’s response to the MMIWG was delayed due the COVID-19 pandemic, it has now committed C$2.2 billion (US$1.7 billion) over five years to implement the Inquiry’s recommendations and related programs. Parliament also has also passed a law to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. How this new law will impact federal government policies relating to Indigenous people remains to be seen. Finally, the federal government’s 2019 antiracism strategy, which included substantial programs to combat anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism, is now operational.",3

Protests, vandalism, and police use of excessive force occurred sporadically throughout 2022, but did not reach the intensity of the unrest seen in 2019.The government’s National Institute for Human Rights (INDH), Human Rights Watch (HRW), and Amnesty International have accused the carabineros and the military of perpetrating human rights violations during the 2019 protests, including excessive use of force against protesters, as well as torture and sexual abuse of people held in detention. The Boric administration established a police reform commission and a reform advisory unit in August 2022. Conflict between Indigenous Mapuche people and the Chilean state continued throughout 2022. The unrest reportedly featured growing violence by some Mapuche activists, including the use of arson attacks against landowners and forestry workers. In October 2021, then president Sebastián Piñera declared a state of emergency in the Araucanía and Biobío regions in response to violent clashes between security forces and Mapuche activists. The state of emergency was extended several times until President Boric took office in March 2022. In response to increasing violence and road blockades, President Boric imposed a new state of emergency in the same areas in May; the new state of emergency, which is reportedly more limited in scope than that under Piñera, remained in place through year’s end. Though Chile has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in Latin America, the country recorded an increased level of violent crime during 2022.

Many judges complain about local officials interfering in cases to protect powerful litigants, support important industries, or avoid their own potential liability.",1,"Violations of due process are widespread in practice. Trials of human rights activists, religious dissidents, and other human rights defenders are routinely held in secret, with even family members being denied information or entry. While adjudication of routine civil and administrative disputes is considered more fair, cases that touch on politically sensitive issues or the interests of powerful groups are subject to decisive “guidance” from party political-legal committees. Prosecutions rely heavily on confessions, many of which are obtained through torture, despite laws prohibiting such practices. Forced confessions are often televised. An ongoing crackdown on human rights lawyers has left many defendants without effective or independent legal counsel.Extrajudicial forms of detention remain widespread. The practice of “residential surveillance in a designated location” allows the police to hold individuals in secret detention for up to six months and has been deployed against human rights defenders and lawyers, and government critics.",1,"Conditions in places of detention are harsh, with reports of inadequate food, regular beatings, and deprivation of medical care. In addition to their use to extract confessions, torture and other forms of coercion are widely employed in efforts to force political and religious dissidents to recant their beliefs. Impunity is the norm for police brutality and suspicious deaths in custody. Citizens and lawyers who seek redress for such abuse are often meet with reprisals or imprisonment. Many political and religious dissidents have died in prison or shortly after release due to ill-treatment or denial of medical care. Peaceful protesters are regularly beaten by police or hired aggressors.The government has gradually reduced the number of crimes that carry the death penalty, though the total was still more than 40 as of 2022. It is estimated that thousands of people are executed each year; the actual figure is considered a state secret. Despite the government’s claim that it has ended the transplantation of organs from executed prisoners, the scale and speed of the transplantation industry far exceed what is feasible via the country’s nascent voluntary donation system.

Several laws bar gender discrimination in the workplace, and some indicators of gender equality have reportedly improved over the past decade. Nevertheless, bias remains endemic, including in job recruitment and college admissions. Women’s rights activists and individuals who campaign against sexual harassment and assault have themselves faced harassment, detention, and in some cases criminal prosecution. In August 2022, Zhou Xiaoxuan lost her landmark case against CCTV host Zhu Jun, whom she had accused of sexual harassment, on the grounds of “insufficient evidence.” She had come forward with the allegations in 2018, helping to galvanize the #MeToo movement in China.

Members of ethnic and religious minority groups, LGBT+ people, people with disabilities, and people with illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B also face discrimination in employment and access to education. Members of religious and ethnic minorities are disproportionately targeted and abused by security forces and in the criminal justice system. In addition to being held in extrajudicial detention in larger numbers, members of these groups tend to be sentenced to longer prison terms than Han Chinese convicts. Data has shown showing higher-than-normal unemployment rates for former COVID-19 patients. Propaganda under Xi’s leadership has sought to negatively associate LGBT+ individuals with liberal “Western” culture, exacerbating discrimination against them.

colombia,"The justice system remains compromised by corruption and extortion. The Constitutional Court, the Council of State, and the Supreme Court have consistently exhibited independence from the executive, though corruption allegations involving members of the courts have damaged their credibility in recent years.

Though critics of the peace accord, previously led by former president Álvaro Uribe, have repeatedly called for shutting down the JEP, it was able to fulfill its mandate without undue interference in 2022.",3,"Colombia’s prosecutorial service is relatively professional, but watchdog groups suggest that key oversight institutions, including the Attorney General’s Office, became less independent during the Duque administration. Due process protections remain weak, and trial processes move very slowly, though a judicial reform passed in June 2021 included provisions intended to accelerate legal processes.The country’s two key transitional justice bodies following the peace accord, the JEP and the Truth Commission, began operations in 2018; by late 2021 they had amassed enormous volumes of evidence and received testimony from thousands of people. The Truth Commission delivered its final report in 2022, calling for “sweeping changes” to the country’s military and for a renewed focus on human rights. The report was disseminated widely, despite fierce criticism from members of the CD. The JEP issued several indictments in 2022, including filing criminal charges against more than a dozen military officials accused of war crimes in July. However, uncertainty remains about the extent to which the bodies will be able to render a comprehensive historical and judicial accounting of Colombia’s conflict.",2,"Many soldiers operate with limited civilian oversight, though the government has in recent years increased human rights training and investigated violations by security forces personnel. Collaboration between security forces and illegal armed groups has declined, but rights groups report official toleration of paramilitary successor groups in some regions. The police lack necessary resources, some units are prone to abuse, and police are largely absent from many rural areas where the most dangerous groups are active. The rights abuses committed by police during the national strike in 2021 prompted calls for deep institutional changes. In response to these calls, President Petro installed new military and police commanders in August 2022; Petro has also promised to reform the controversial riot control forces and to remove the police from the Ministry of Defense, though these changes had not been implemented before year’s end. Reforms to the national police disciplinary code were enacted in March, introducing new provisions that impose stricter penalties for police officers found to have used excessive force.Civil-military relations have been a source of significant tension in recent years. A portion of the armed forces opposed the peace process, and the ability of accused human rights violators within the military to receive benefits under the transitional justice system is one of the most controversial elements of the process. Scandals involving both corruption and rights violations have continued to buffet the military, including the bombing of a FARC dissident camp in March 2021 that killed several minors. Some parts of the country, particularly resource-rich zones and drug-trafficking corridors, remain highly insecure. Remnant guerrilla forces—including both the ELN and dissident factions of the FARC—and paramilitary successor groups regularly abuse the civilian population, especially in coca-growing areas. However, President Petro has spoken out against the “irrational” war on drugs, saying that the associated violence has been fueled by militaristic anti-drug policies. A general conflict fragmentation and intensification has affected some areas, illustrated by a continuing rise in the number of people affected by mass displacement—in December 2022, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that over 78,000 people were displaced during the year. After Petro took office in August, a number of criminal organizations expressed willingness to accept an offer of more lenient terms of surrender to the state, resulting in a fragile truce that temporarily improved safety for citizens in some areas.A steady trickle of former FARC combatants, including several high-ranking members, have returned to clandestine life, alleging government failure to abide by the accord’s terms. Indepaz estimated the total number of “dissidents” at around 5,200 in October 2021; several of the most prominent dissidents have been killed in internecine fighting in Venezuela during 2021–22. President Petro proposed a new peace deal with FARC dissidents in August 2022, sparking criticism from the top government negotiators of the 2016 peace agreements. The Petro administration also began negotiations with the ELN in December, marking the first new talks with the organization since 2019. That month, the government announced a six-month cease-fire with the ELN, FARC dissidents, and three other armed groups; the ELN later denied adopting such an agreement. Violence overall has significantly subsided since the internal conflict peaked in the early 2000s, but analysts have noted a gradual trend upward since 2017. The homicide rate decreased slightly between 2021 and 2022, but remained relatively high, with more than 12,000 cases reported as of November 2022. Impunity for crime in general is rampant, and prison conditions remain harsh.",2,"The legal framework provides protections against various forms of discrimination based on gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity, and other categories, and the government takes some measures to enforce these protections. Nevertheless, several vulnerable groups suffer serious disadvantages in practice.Afro-Colombians, who account for as much as 25 percent of the population, make up the largest segment of the more than 7 million people who have been displaced by violence. Areas with concentrated Afro-Colombian populations continue to suffer vastly disproportionate levels of abuse by guerrillas, security forces, and criminal groups. UN officials have reported that impunity is nearly absolute for killers of Afro-Colombian and Indigenous ex-combatants and social leaders.Most of Colombia’s Indigenous inhabitants, who make up more than 3 percent of the population, live on approximately 34 million hectares granted to them by the government, often in resource-rich, strategic regions that are highly contested by armed groups. Indigenous people have been targeted by all sides in the country’s various conflicts. In 2022, Indigenous communities in the departments of Chocó, Cauca, Valle de Cauca, and Nariño suffered widespread violence and displacement perpetrated by former FARC members, paramilitary successors, and criminal groups.Women face employment discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, as well as gender-based violence. In June 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled that businesses must take steps to prevent and punish workplace gender violence.Though Colombian law prohibits LGBT+ discrimination, LGBT+ individuals often suffer societal discrimination and abuse, and there are high levels of impunity for crimes committed against them. According to Colombian NGO Caribe Afirmativo, 49 LGBT+ people were murdered between January and August 2022.As many as 2.4 million Venezuelan migrants have entered Colombia in recent years, and the government has offered work permits, access to services, and other accommodations to those who register. International relief agencies praised a February 2021 government announcement that Venezuelan migrants would be granted long-term temporary protection status, though stigmatization, discrimination, and lack of access to services remain problems.",2
comoros,"The judicial system is based on both Sharia (Islamic law) and the French legal code. Though the law establishes mechanisms for the selection of judges and attorneys, the executive often disregards these and simply appoints people to their positions. Court decisions are not always upheld.The 2018 referendum abolished the Constitutional Court and established a new constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. This chamber ruled in favor of the government during the March 2019 election period by barring several candidates from running and by validating the results, despite widespread concerns over voting irregularities.",1,"All defendants have the right to a fair public trial, but they often face lengthy delays. Due-process rights are affected by corruption.Political figures, including candidates, have been denied due process. Former president Sambi’s legal pretrial detention period ended in April 2019, but he remained under house arrest until his trial in November 2022. Sambi refused to attend the trial after the first day, calling the proceedings “illegitimate”; some observers have called Sambi a political prisoner. Though Sambi was initially charged with corruption, at his trial, he was sentenced to life in prison for the crime of “high treason”—a crime his lawyers claim does not exist in Comorian law. In May 2020, Inssa “Bobocha” Mohamed was arrested for allegedly attacking President Azali in an unsuccessful bombing the previous month. Bobocha remained in pretrial detention until escaping from prison that November; he was returned to custody in January 2021. He was allegedly held as a “secret prisoner” before his March 2022 trial, after which he was sentenced to eight years in prison for “criminal association and conspiracy.”",1,"The law prohibits the illegitimate use of physical force, but security agents have engaged in excessive force, and are generally not held accountable for such behavior.

In 2021, the Constitutional Court rejected legitimate objections to the conduct of that March’s elections.",0,"Defendants, including the government’s political opponents, are routinely denied due process.

Other fair-trial rights guaranteed by law, including the right to legal assistance for those who cannot afford it, are not always honored in practice.",1,Citizens in some neighborhoods are at risk of intimidation and violent crime by groups of young men known as bébés noirs. There have also been reports of arbitrary arrests and physical abuses by police attempting to curb the activities of such groups. Reports of human rights violations by security forces are generally not investigated by the government.,0,"Employment discrimination against women persists. The government prevents refugees and other foreign workers from holding certain jobs, and refugees sometimes face harassment and arrest by authorities.While no law specifically prohibits same-sex sexual relations between adults, LGBT+ people experience occasional police harassment.Minority ethnic groups experience severe discrimination in employment, housing, and education. Some communities often live in substandard housing on the outskirts of villages, and occasionally are targeted in acts of violence committed by members of the majority Bantu population.The government exhibits widespread discrimination against residents of Congo’s southern regions. They are routinely denied high-paying public-sector jobs, as well as admission to the public university. By contrast, residents of Congo’s northern regions are disproportionately appointed to key government positions and the civil service.",0

Authorities estimated a homicide rate of 12 per 100,000 people in 2022. Criminal groups transport drugs along the coasts, and the government has reported that many homicides there are related to organized crime and drug trafficking. There are reports of occasional police abuses of detainees and civilians; confirmed cases are generally investigated and prosecuted.Overcrowding, poor sanitation, insufficient access to health care, and violence remain serious problems in prisons. Recurrent abuse by prison police has not been thoroughly investigated due to victims’ reluctance to file formal complaints.",3,"The constitution outlines equal rights for all people, but rights are upheld unevenly. Indigenous people face discrimination, particularly regarding land rights and access to basic services. In recent years, conflict over land disputes has led to Indigenous groups being targeted by lawsuits and violence. In August 2022, an Indigenous rights organization reported that Indigenous communities and individuals in Costa Rica had been subjected to at least 63 violent attacks in 2021, including incidents of harassment, arson, and physical assault. At least 26 attacks were reportedly perpetrated or permitted by police forces.Costa Ricans of African descent have faced discrimination in health care, education, and employment. A law recognizing the historical discrimination against Afro–Costa Ricans stipulates that, for a period of 10 years, public institutions must allocate at least 7 percent of vacant positions annually to people of African descent. The law also mandates the inclusion of the legacy of Afro–Costa Ricans in the country’s history in public education curriculums.Women experience discrimination due to entrenched stereotypes, which can limit their equal access to employment, health services, and the justice system. In recent years, femicide laws have been expanded and penalties for the crime increased.Executive orders prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. However, law enforcement officials have discriminated against LGBT+ people, and there have been reports of attacks by police on transgender sex workers.The number of people seeking asylum in Costa Rica has risen sharply in recent years. In September 2022, government officials confirmed there were over 200,000 pending asylum applications, and another 50,000 people waiting to make a formal application. Although the law entitles asylum seekers to access public services, discrimination sometimes prevents such access in practice. In November 2022, President Chaves signed two immigration-related decrees. The first decree, effective at the time of publication, reformed the country’s refugee regulations: among other things, refugees will no longer be immediately issued a work permit, and asylum seekers are prohibited from leaving the country while their applications are being processed. The second decree, which had not come into effect as of year-end 2022, provides a way for migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua—who account for approximately 96 percent of asylum seekers in the country—to regularize their immigration status.",3
cote-divoire,"The judiciary is not independent, and judges are highly susceptible to external interference and bribes. Processes governing the assignment of cases to judges are opaque. The courts generally adjudicate cases in accordance with the ruling party’s political interests; the judiciary was fully mobilized to support President Ouattara’s third term and remains supportive of his policies.",1,"The constitution guarantees equal access to justice and due process for all citizens, but these guarantees are poorly upheld in practice. The state struggles to provide attorneys to defendants who cannot afford legal counsel. Security officials are susceptible to bribery and are rarely held accountable for misconduct. Prolonged pretrial detention is a serious problem for both adults and minors, with some detainees spending years in prison without trial. In 2018, the lower house adopted a new Code of Criminal Procedure that included a circuit of criminal courts to address the backlog.",1,"Physical violence against civilians in the form of extortion, banditry, and sexual violence—sometimes perpetrated by members of the armed forces—remain common. Disputes over land use and ownership between migrants and those who claim customary land rights sometimes turn violent. The country’s prisons are severely overcrowded, and incarcerated adults and minors are not always separated.Concerns about impunity, victor’s justice, and reconciliation have persisted after the close of the 2010–11 conflict. To date, only a handful of individuals have been put on trial for crimes committed during that period, and most prosecutions have focused on figures associated with Gbagbo. In 2018, Ouattara pardoned 800 people accused or convicted of committing violent acts during the 2010–11 conflict, including former first lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, ostensibly to foster reconciliation. In 2019, Laurent Gbagbo was acquitted of crimes against humanity during the 2010–11 conflict by the ICC and was conditionally released; he returned to Côte d’Ivoire in 2021 after the acquittal was upheld. In August 2022, President Ouattara offered a pardon to Laurent Gbagbo, who faced a 20-year sentence related to the alleged robbery of BCEAO assets during the 2010–11 conflict. Ouattara cited the need for “social cohesion” when announcing that offer.Terrorist attacks have occurred in the north of country, along the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali, in recent years. In 2021, the head of the General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), a French intelligence agency, warned that terrorist groups were planning to expand their operations in Côte d’Ivoire. The Ivorian government increased its budget for antiterrorism programs in the north that December.Côte d’Ivoire has participated in the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA); in July 2022, Malian authorities arrested 49 Ivorian soldiers who Abidjan said were sent to take part in MINUSMA. Forty-six of them received prison sentences for undermining Malian security in December, while three who had been released in September received death sentences in absentia. In November, the Ivorian government announced it would end its participation in the peacekeeping mission by August 2023.",2,"Same-sex relations are not criminalized in Côte d’Ivoire, but LGBT+ people can face prosecution under criminal code language amended in 2019 that references “unnatural acts” and “moral sensitivity.” No law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation.

croatia,"While judicial independence is generally respected, there have been recent concerns about the influence of extreme right-wing groups on the judiciary. Critics allege the courts have been ruling in line with the views of right-wing NGOs and the HDZ, while the courts maintain that they are redressing partisan rulings of the Yugoslav communist era. Judges have also faced corruption allegations in recent years; three judges were arrested in 2021 over bribery accusations lodged by football club administrator Zdravko Mamić, who himself was convicted of corruption in absentia in 2018.",3,"Due process rights are generally upheld, but the system tends to work more efficiently for individuals with abundant resources or high social standing.The International Commission on Missing Persons has criticized Croatia for its slow progress in identifying human remains of victims of the 1991–95 conflicts and in making reparations to survivors and their families.",3,"Violence by state and nonstate actors is uncommon.

The device’s operator was unknown as it bore both Soviet and Ukrainian markings, but no one was injured in the crash.Prison conditions do not meet international standards due to overcrowding and inadequate medical care.",3,"Ethnic and religious minorities and LGBT+ people in Croatia face discrimination. A group of NGOs criticized the government for lacking a comprehensive human rights policy in 2018 and warned of the continuing deterioration of protection of human rights in the country, especially for marginalized groups and women. According to a 2021 Council of Europe report on the protection of national minorities, ethnic Serbs continue to face high levels of discrimination.Analysts have expressed concerns that the increasing visibility of far-right, nationalist groups has allowed discriminatory rhetoric to spread. Occasionally, the government’s actions suggest their endorsement of far-right groups, and observers have expressed concern that the government has tacitly approved of discriminatory behavior. The Croatian Defense Forces (HOS), a right-wing militia that uses Ustaša-era and other fascist symbols, has maintained ties with HDZ members in recent years. In April 2022, a group of students in the Slavonia region were photographed wearing HOS paraphernalia and offering fascist salutes with their teacher present.The constitution prohibits gender discrimination, but women earn less than men for comparable work and hold fewer leadership positions.Police have engaged in violence, including sexual violence and torture in some cases, against migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Police have also engaged in illegal pushbacks along the border with BiH.

The Council of State is also empowered to issue “instructions of a general character” to the courts, whose rulings typically conform to the interests of the PCC. In May 2022, the independent Cuban press published a video from 2018 of a meeting between the president of the Supreme Court, Rubén Remigio Ferro, and various individuals, including prosecutors and officials from the Ministry of the Interior. In the video, Remigio expressly recognized that the judiciary is controlled by the PCC and that, in practice, judges are required to issue rulings in line with PCC policies.",0,"The regime’s systematic violation of due process is regularly illustrated by trumped-up criminal cases against dissidents and independent journalists. Cubans facing trial do not benefit from speedy proceedings. Those arrested on July 11, 2021 faced due process violations, and the judiciary held summary trials against defendants. Courts issued convictions and sentences against 40 people by early August, though none of those individuals benefited from legal representation. Another round of trials reportedly took place in December, with the US State Department noting that over 150 defendants received prison sentences during those proceedings; some defendants convicted in December received terms of up to 30 years. Summary trials and sentencing of protesters continued in 2022.",0,"Although violent crime rates are believed to be relatively low, physical security for the population is undermined by government-backed violence. Opposition activists, human rights defenders, and other perceived enemies of the regime are routinely subjected to public assaults, excessive use of force by police during raids and arrests, and abuse in custody. The government has repeatedly refused to allow international monitoring of its prisons. Prison conditions are poor, featuring overcrowding, forced labor, inadequate sanitation and medical care, and physical abuse.Following the surge in popular protests seen in 2021 and 2022, explicit violence against demonstrators at the hands of the authorities has reportedly increased in frequency. In July 2021, security forces used live ammunition against protesters and subsequently engaged in violent and degrading treatment—including torture, sleep deprivation, and threats of reprisal—against those taken into custody. In 2022, security forces continued to violently repress protests and perceived dissidents across the country, with many individuals subjected to physical assaults and arbitrary arrests.",0,"Article 42 of the 2019 constitution extended protection from discrimination to a wider array of vulnerable groups, explicitly adding categories such as ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, and disability to the existing safeguards regarding race, sex, national origin, and religion. PCC control of the government and justice system limits the ability to enforce such guarantees impartially or effectively, and independent calls for equal treatment can draw state reprisals.Women enjoy legal equality and are well represented in most professions, though their labor force participation rate lags well behind that of men, suggesting persistent economic disparities and cultural double standards. Discrimination based on sexual orientation was criminalized in the new penal code passed in May 2022. Also, in a national referendum in September, a new family code that recognizes same-sex marriage and the right of same-sex couples to adopt or be beneficiaries of assisted reproduction techniques was approved with 67 percent of the vote.

Partly as a result of this rise, there were some 30,000 asylum applications pending at the end of 2022, up from nearly 19,000 at the end of 2021. A specialized administrative court began operating in 2019 to handle appeals. In 2021, the government simplified procedures for hiring asylum seekers, though they were permitted to work only in certain sectors and categories of employment. Most asylum seekers arrive by land through the TRNC, prompting allegations from the Cypriot government that Ankara is encouraging irregular migration. Cypriot authorities have engaged in controversial maritime pushbacks to Lebanon to prevent arrivals by sea.Overcrowding and other poor conditions at the Pournara reception center have been exacerbated by the rise in new arrivals, prompting periodic protests by the residents. The center, built in 2014 as an emergency reception facility for up to 400 people, was later expanded to accommodate 1,000. By 2022 it reportedly hosted more than 2,000 people, with authorities struggling to properly house unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable groups.Gender discrimination in the workplace remains a problem, including with respect to hiring practices, salaries, and sexual harassment; laws against such discrimination have not been adequately enforced.Antidiscrimination laws generally prohibit bias based on sexual orientation, and there are legal protections for transgender people on some issues.

Further, children born to Danish parents in conflict zones are no longer granted Danish citizenship at birth, and the Danish foreign service may deny fighters in foreign conflicts consular assistance. As of April 2022, 12 people considered to be “foreign fighters” had been stripped of their Danish citizenship.

The permits for both groups expire after two years—with Ukrainians given the option of a one-year extension—after which refugees must apply for asylum or for a different type of residency. In recent years, controversy has arisen over the disproportionate number of people with non-Danish ethnic ancestry in the justice system. In March 2022, the Danish Institute of Human Rights (DIHR) released a report indicating that immigrants are more likely to be falsely accused of a crime than ethnic Danish people. The report cites data showing that first- and second-generation immigrants are 27 percent and 45 percent more likely, respectively, to be charged with a crime that ends in dropped charges or an acquittal than are ethnic Danish people.In October 2021, 14 out of 19 children with a claim to Danish citizenship who had been living at the Syrian al-Hol and al-Roj prison camps arrived back in Denmark with their mothers. The Danish government offered to retrieve the remaining five children but not their mothers, whom the government accused of association with the IS, but the offer was rejected by the mothers. The organization Repatriate the Children raised the issue in the Danish city courts in May 2022, suing the government on behalf of three of the children and two of the mothers. The trial concluded in December 2022 with a ruling in favor of the Danish state. In February 2022, the admissibility of a case, Johansen v. Denmark, was arbitrated at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The case, which concerned the deprivation of a dual citizen’s Danish citizenship following a conviction on terrorism charges, was deemed inadmissible due to the complaint being “manifestly ill-founded.” The court highlighted “that it was legitimate for Contracting States to take a firm stand against terrorism, which in itself constituted a grave threat to human rights.”",3

It often shows bias against the opposition and civil society, while government allies typically enjoy impunity for abuses.",1,"Courts are concentrated in urban areas; rural areas rely on customary courts. Informal justice mechanisms are common throughout the country. Civilians are often tried in military courts, which have weak safeguards for defendants’ rights and poor witness-protection mechanisms. These courts are also subject to interference from high-ranking military personnel.The state of siege in North Kivu and Ituri enacted martial law but only authorized military courts to try criminal, not civilian cases, resulting in growing detentions and stalled judicial cases. Arbitrary arrests and detentions are common, as is prolonged pretrial detention; much of the prison population consists of pretrial detainees. Prisoners frequently pay bribes to avoid torture or meet basic needs; rape among detainees is common.DRC courts have officially granted reparations to the targets of sexual violence and other serious crimes, but these are rarely paid in practice.",0,"Civilian authorities do not effectively control security forces. The military is notoriously undisciplined; soldiers are known to exchange intelligence and weapons with rebel or militia groups. Soldiers and police regularly commit serious human rights abuses, including rape and other physical attacks, and high-ranking military officials enjoy impunity for crimes. Despite the government’s promise to “eradicate” militia groups during the 2021 state of siege, affected areas still suffer widespread violence.Armed groups have contributed to years of conflict and communal violence that have had a catastrophic impact on civilians, with over five million conflict-related deaths since 1998. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reports that 120 such groups are active in four eastern provinces. M23, which claims to defend ethnic Tutsis against Hutu opponents and last fought in the DRC in the early 2010s, launched a renewed campaign in 2021 and was active in 2022. In June, M23 fighters killed at least 17 people in North Kivu for allegedly reporting their location to government forces. M23 forces later disrupted supply lines serving the city of Goma. In November, the New Humanitarian news outlet reported that 280,000 people had been displaced by the fighting.In April 2022, EAC member states agreed to launch an armed mission against M23; Burundian troops affiliated with that mission were deployed by August. While the Rwandan government, which is widely believed to support M23, negotiated a truce with Kinshasa in November, M23 fighters did not immediately lay down their arms. In late December, M23 fighters said they would retreat from Kibumba, a strategic town near Goma.MONUSCO has been active in the DRC since 2010 but Congolese have criticized its performance. Those who participated in the violent July 2022 protests called the mission ineffective, especially in the face of M23, and demanded MONUSCO’s immediate withdrawal. In August, the government said it would reconsider the MONUSCO withdrawal plan, under which the mission would continue through 2024. In late December, the UN Security Council voted to extend MONUSCO through the end of 2023.",0,"Although the constitution prohibits discrimination against women, they face discrimination in nearly every aspect of their lives. The family code assigns women a subordinate role in the household. Ethnic discrimination is common. Kinyarwanda-language speakers and ethnic Tutsis face discrimination and hate speech, which was widely disseminated on social networks during M23’s 2022 campaign. Indigenous peoples also face pervasive discrimination and have limited access to public services. In November, President Tshisekedi signed a law meant to expand access to services, address discrimination, and respect land rights. People with disabilities remain nationally marginalized despite the creation of a ministry dedicated to people with disabilities.Although homosexuality is not explicitly criminalized, LGBT+ people are marginalized and forced to hide their sexual orientation. Penal-code provisions, including those for “insulting morals” and “offending modesty” have been used against LGBT+ people.",0
ecuador,"Ecuador’s highest-ranking judicial bodies are the 21-member National Court of Justice and the 9-member Constitutional Court. Both courts faced attacks on their autonomy during the Correa era, but judicial independence increased during the Moreno administration. The passage of the 2018 referendum restructured the CPCCS, a powerful body responsible for appointing the attorney general, and the Judiciary Council, which appoints judges. All CPCCS members, who were considered allies of the Correa government, and Judiciary Council members were replaced. More controversially, the transitional CPCCS had significant influence over the composition of the Constitutional Court, despite its lack of jurisdiction. The transitional CPCCS voted to remove all nine judges on the court, citing corruption and a lack of independence within the body, and created a committee to select the court’s new members, who were selected and approved in early 2019. Later that year, the new court ratified the legality of the transitional CPCCS’s actions.In October 2022, legislators from UNES and PSC attempted to impeach members of the Judiciary Council for their roles in the 2019 evaluation and removal of National Court justices. The motion to impeach did not pass, and was dismissed in October.",2,"Judicial processes remain slow, and procedures designed to expedite cases have been implemented at the detriment of defendants’ due process rights. Many people are held in pretrial detention for longer than is permitted by law. While the number of public defenders has increased in recent years, the state is still unable to provide adequate legal counsel for all defendants who are unable to supply their own. During his tenure, former president Correa and his allies frequently intervened in court cases, telling judges how they should rule, and sometimes removing judges who refused to comply. Under former president Moreno, such blatant interference in court proceedings diminished, allowing defendants more fair public hearings of their cases. Despite improvements in the post-Correa era, reports of due process infringements, including trial delays and “improper pressure” on the judiciary have continued during the Lasso administration.",2,"Allegations of police abuse of suspects and detainees are common. In August 2022, legislation regulating the use of force by security personnel came into effect. However, reports of excessive use of force by police continued.Multiple groups that conducted investigations into the 2019 protest violence, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), found that state agents committed human rights violations during the protests, but investigations had not yielded charges. Prisons are overcrowded and understaffed, and gang- and drug-related violence is rampant. As of October 2022, there are more than 32,000 inmates, 41 percent of whom are awaiting trial. Major security incidents regularly occur in Ecuadorian prisons, where more than 400 inmates were killed between February 2021 and November 2022. In September 2021, 119 inmates were killed in a high-security prison in Guayaquil after a dispute between two rival criminal gangs became violent. Various media outlets reported that the aggressors were heavily armed with machetes, knives, rifles, semiautomatic weapons, and grenades. The events in Guayaquil highlighted the state’s inability to protect prisoners from gangs and drug cartels, and was the most fatal such incident in the country’s history. Ecuador experienced a significant increase in violent crime in 2022, recording over 4,500 homicides—more than double the number recorded during the previous year—the country’s “highest homicide rate in decades,” according to Interior Minister Juan Zapata. Zapata attributed 83 percent of these deaths to drug trafficking and gang activity.In response to a series of car bombs and explosions in Guayaquil and Esmeraldas in November, President Lasso declared a state of emergency to allow police and armed forces to conduct security operations aimed at curbing the violence.",2,"Indigenous people continue to suffer widespread societal discrimination, and oil-drilling and mining projects on Indigenous lands are frequently carried out without consulting local Indigenous communities, as required by the constitution. In July 2020, the Constitutional Court reinforced consultation requirements for proposed changes to the status of Indigenous ancestral territories.Ecuador is one of the largest recipients of refugees in Latin America. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Ecuador hosted over 502,000 Venezuelans as of the end of 2022. Many Venezuelan immigrants have reported facing discrimination and xenophobia, amid unfounded accusations that their arrival has caused a spike in crime and violence in the country. In addition, approximately 250,000 refugees from Colombia have entered Ecuador since the late 1990s, and thousands have remained.",2
egypt,"The executive branch exerts influence over the courts, which typically protect the interests of the government, military, and security apparatus and have often disregarded due process and other basic safeguards in cases against the government’s political opponents and all forms of independent expression. The 2019 constitutional amendments further strengthened the president’s supervisory and appointment powers over the judiciary and undermined its independence.In July 2022, President Sisi appointed a military general to be the Supreme Constitutional Court’s first deputy justice, which further placed the country’s institutions under Sisi’s control. The emergency courts that Sisi used to prosecute government critics and opposition figures were in effect until October 2021, when the state of emergency was suspended.",1,"Since 2013, Egyptian authorities have increasingly imposed months- or even years-long pretrial detentions on opposition members, journalists, and activists as retribution for their activities. These due process violations have normalized the use of the justice system for political purposes.Although the constitution limits military trials of civilians, a 2014 presidential decree placed all “public and vital facilities” under military jurisdiction, resulting in the referral of thousands of civilian defendants to military courts. That change was made permanent in November 2021. Charges brought in military courts are often vague or fabricated, defendants are denied due process, and basic evidentiary standards are routinely disregarded.In October 2021, President Sisi suspended the state of emergency imposed in 2017, which should have ended the use of emergency courts that do not satisfy the minimum standards of fair trials. However, his decision did not preclude hearing cases that were already referred to those courts, nor did it invalidate repressive legislation that was integrated into criminal law.In April 2022, President Sisi reactivated so-called pardon committees to review the status of political prisoners; while 332 people were reportedly pardoned as of August, authorities arbitrarily detained far more people during the same period.",0,"Police brutality and impunity for abuses by security forces were catalysts for the 2011 uprising against former president Hosni Mubarak, but no reforms have since been enacted and security forces continue to wield illegitimate force with impunity. Counterterrorism laws provide a vague definition of terrorism and grant law enforcement personnel sweeping powers and immunity in enforcement. Prison conditions are very poor, and prisons were grossly unequipped during the COVID-19 pandemic to treat the illness or prevent its spread. Inmates are subject to physical abuse, overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and denial of medical care.Since President Sisi effectively came to power, dozens of people have died in custody amid credible reports of torture or denial of timely and adequate health care. In 2021 alone, at least 52 detainees died in custody following medical complications and at least 4 following reports of torture. Prominent economist and government critic Ayman Hadhoud, who had been researching the military’s role in the economy, disappeared in February 2022 and died in March, likely due to physical assault and torture he experienced while in custody. Use of the death penalty has increased dramatically since Sisi took power, despite serious concerns about due process violations and politicized prosecutions.Conflict continues between security forces and adherents of the Islamic State (IS) militant group based in the North Sinai region. Terrorist attacks and military operations have resulted in civilian casualties. For years, Egyptian security forces have carried out extrajudicial executions while claiming that the victims had been killed in shootouts.",0,"Though the constitution stipulates equality for women, women face extensive discrimination, particularly in employment and in the justice system. Coptic Christians, other religious minorities such as Baha’i people, people with dark skin from southern Egypt, people with disabilities, LGBT+ people, and migrants and refugees from sub-Saharan Africa also face various forms of discrimination and harassment. In March 2022, Amnesty International called on the government to halt the deportations of Eritrean nationals, accusing it of engaging in refoulement.There are different personal status laws governing Muslims and Christians, which commonly results in discrimination against Christians.While same-sex sexual conduct is not explicitly banned, people suspected of such activity can be charged with prostitution or “debauchery.” The police regularly arrest people on such charges.",1
el-salvador,"Judicial independence has long been under pressure, and the judicial system is hampered by corruption. Elected officials do not always observe judicial rulings and powerful individuals can evade justice by exerting pressure on the judiciary.The Bukele administration repeatedly defied court orders related to its COVID-19 response during 2020. In the first session of the new legislature in May 2021, the government-aligned legislators removed all members of the CSJ’s Constitutional Chamber, as well as the prosecutor general. Though the Constitutional Chamber immediately ruled that these actions were unconstitutional and a violation of judicial independence, the legislature went forward naming new members of the Constitutional Chamber and a new attorney general. In the next days, the ousted judges submitted their resignations, allegedly under duress, amid reports that the homes of some of deposed magistrates were being monitored by the police.In August 2021, President Bukele announced a “purge” of the judiciary, and the legislature days later passed measures to dismiss judges and prosecutors over 60 years old or who had more than 30 years of service, impacting one in three judges and numerous prosecutors. The reforms also changed the mechanism for appointing and reassigning judges to a seemingly arbitrary process, which was condemned by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers.The government unconstitutionally instituted a state of exception in March 2022, and extended it on multiple occasions with parliamentary rubber-stamps. Yet the CSJ has failed to deliberate on the legality of the ongoing state of exception, resolve more than 1,300 petitions for habeas corpus, or address thousands of human rights violations linked to the near 60,000 arrests that authorities have carried out. Criminal courts have broadly failed to act independently from government pressure and defiant judges have been removed.The Bukele administration continues to resist calls to cooperate in the ongoing El Mozote trial, in which 17 high-ranking military officers stand accused of massacring nearly 1,000 people in the northeastern town of El Mozote in 1981.",0,"Since the end of the war in 1992, due process rights are constitutionally guaranteed but systematically violated. Human rights advocates report that police routinely carry out arbitrary arrests and fabricate and plant evidence, and defendants have long been provided inadequate access to effective legal counsel.These long-standing challenges escalated sharply in March 2022, when the government instituted an indefinite state of exception, which led to the arbitrary arrests of over 60,000 people suspected of gang activity. Authorities suspended constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and association, eliminated various rights of people accused of crimes, and routinely violated citizens’ privacy by allowing law enforcement to access and surveil individuals’ communications without a court order. Criminal courts have remanded virtually all detainees to indefinite custody, without individual scrutiny or respect for due process.Furthermore, the government passed amendments in March 2022 to the criminal code to increase the maximum punishment for being a gang leader to 45 years’ imprisonment and for being a gang member to 30 years’ imprisonment. The criminal procedural code was also amended to mandate pretrial detention for charges of gang membership, homicide, and extortion, and to remove the limit on the duration of pretrial detention in these cases, effectively establishing unlimited incarceration without a conviction. The same loss of rights largely applies to minors. ",0,"Crime and violence, much of which has long been linked to gangs, remain grave problems. Yet, homicides have declined sharply since mid-2019 under alleged secret agreements and negotiations between the Bukele government and the country’s gangs, which the president denies. Reportedly, agreements broke down in March 2022, after which the government immediately implemented a state of exception that has kept homicide rates under control: government statistics claim a 50 percent drop in the murder rate for 2022.Under the state of exception, the number of incarcerated persons has more than doubled, leading to acute overcrowding with wholly insufficient infrastructure and resources to guarantee basic rights, including food, water, and healthcare. People imprisoned are not allowed family visits and have limited access to lawyers.Civilians in El Salvador are vulnerable to forced disappearances. The University Observatory of Human Rights (OUDH) reported that between January 2020 and June 2022, there were 4,060 forced disappearances, while police figures for that period claim 692 people disappeared. Relatives of the disappeared often fear reprisals for discussing their cases publicly.",2,"Men and women are granted equal rights under the law, but women are often subject to discrimination. Indigenous people disproportionately face poverty, unemployment, and labor discrimination. Certain other populations, particularly internally displaced persons and LGBT+ people, also have inadequate access to the justice system. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is prevalent, and LGBT+ people are often the targets of hate crimes and violence, including by state security agents. The government restricted the rights of asylum seekers by signing an agreement with the United States in 2019, whereby El Salvador would accept asylum seekers trying to reach the United States and stop them from traveling north.",2
equatorial-guinea,"The judiciary is not independent, and judges in sensitive cases often consult with the office of the president before issuing important rulings. Under the constitution, the president is the nation’s first magistrate. He also oversees the body that nominates judges. The court system’s impartiality is further undermined by corruption. Judges are regularly accused of taking bribes.In July 2022, the president of the Supreme Court resigned in the face of allegations that he had received a bribe from a private company. Teodorín stated on social media that the judge had admitted to the crime. A new Supreme Court president was appointed by decree later that month.",0,"Security forces routinely detain people without charge, and defendants’ due process rights are not respected. Military courts, which are empowered to try civilians for certain crimes, have even fewer due process protections than civilian courts and lack an avenue for appeal.",0,"Beatings, torture, and forced disappearances by security forces are reportedly common. Prisons are overcrowded and feature harsh conditions, including physical abuse, poor sanitation, and denial of medical care.In May 2022, Teodorín launched a law enforcement campaign to suppress violence by criminal gangs. Authorities detained thousands of people over the course of several months, and at least four died in custody.A revised penal code that was enacted in September eliminated the death penalty, though capital punishment is still allowed under the code of military justice. The most recent execution was carried out in 2014.",0,"There are few legal protections against discrimination. Women face discrimination in employment and other matters, particularly in rural areas. Ethnic minority groups such as the Bubi, Ndowe, and Annobonese suffer persistent societal discrimination in the form of harassment from law enforcement officials or difficulties accessing public services.Immigrants, including irregular migrants, are subject to raids, physical abuse, and extortion by police. Same-sex sexual activity is not illegal, but LGBT+ people face social stigma and mistreatment including street harassment and discrimination in the workplace.",0
eritrea,"The judiciary has no independence from the executive branch. The Supreme Court called for in the constitution has never been established, nor has a Judicial Commission tasked with appointing judges. The president controls the appointment and dismissal of all judges; even nominally elected judges in local community courts are controlled by the Justice Ministry, according to UN investigators. Many judges are military officers.",0,"Basic principles of due process are systematically violated. Arbitrary arrests and detentions are common; targets include those who evade military service, try to flee the country, or are suspected of practicing an unauthorized religion. Eritreans who offend high-ranking government or party officials are also reportedly subject to arbitrary arrest.Prisoners, including children, former members of the government, and their family members, are routinely held incommunicado for indefinite periods without charge or trial, with the authorities refusing even to inform family members whether they are still alive. There is no operational system of public defense lawyers. Thousands of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience remain imprisoned.",0,"UN investigators have described the routine and systematic use of physical and psychological torture in both civilian and military detention centers. Deaths in custody or in military service due to torture and other harsh conditions have been reported, though authorities do not investigate such incidents. Security forces employ lethal violence arbitrarily and with impunity. Individuals attempting to escape military service or flee the country have been fired on by soldiers.Eritrean forces continued to operate in Ethiopia in support of Addis Ababa’s military campaign against the TPLF during the year. In March 2021, Human Rights Concern–Eritrea reported that boys were being pressed into military service and sent to the Tigray region of Ethiopia.Eritrean forces engaged in violence against civilians during their deployment. In 2022, Eritrean forces continued to occupy parts of Tigray with atrocities committed by Eritrean groups consistently documented by different rights groups. In September 2022, Eritrean authorities began a nationwide forced conscription campaign, in order to send more troops to Tigray. The mobilization campaign intensified in October, when security forces violently tracked down those who attempted to escape being drafted. Reports emerged that family members of individuals who were in hiding had been detained to coerce them out of hiding.",0,"There are allegations that two of Eritrea’s nine recognized ethnic groups, the Kunama and Afar, face severe discrimination, including exclusion from the government’s poverty alleviation programs.Laws mandate equal educational opportunity for women and equal pay for equal work.

estonia,The judiciary is independent and generally free from government or other interference.,4,"Legal processes in civil and criminal matters are generally free and fair. Laws prohibiting arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring the right to a fair trial are largely observed. Court fees were raised significantly in January 2022, but there are many exemptions built into the fee structures.",4,"While Estonians generally enjoy physical security, the country’s steadily declining intentional homicide rate remains one of the highest in the EU. Prison conditions do not fully meet international standards, and some inmates reportedly have inadequate access to health care. Estonia has a relatively high incarceration rate, with 165 people incarcerated per 100,000 residents in 2021, according to Eurostat data.",3,"The constitution and laws provide broad safeguards against discrimination based on race, gender, language, sexual orientation, and other such categories. However, Russian-speaking residents continue to face societal discrimination, and some statutes lack robust protections against such bias. Gender discrimination is also a problem, particularly in employment, and the gender pay gap is among the highest in the EU, though it has decreased in recent years. Roma face employment discrimination and disparities in educational outcomes.The rhetoric and ideological beliefs of many active EKRE members have increased the prevalence of hostile and extremist views toward Jewish, Muslim, and LGBT+ people, as well as other marginalized groups. In 2020, the European Commission began infringement proceedings against Estonia for failing to match EU regulations for prosecuting hate crimes and criminalizing hate speech in domestic laws; legislation resolving the discrepancies had not been passed as of the end of 2022.In August 2022, Estonia legalized the pushback of migrants during “emergencies caused by mass immigration.” Although the measures were not applied systematically during the year, not all Ukrainian refugees attempting to cross the eastern border of the country were permitted to enter. In September, along with other Baltic states and Poland, Estonia effectively closed its borders to Russian citizens.",3
eswatini,"Although the judiciary displays a degree of independence in some cases, the king holds ultimate authority over the appointment and removal of judges, acting on advice from the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) made up of royal appointees.

Detainees are generally granted access to lawyers, though only those facing life imprisonment or capital punishment can obtain counsel at public expense. Lengthy pretrial detention is common. Two prodemocracy members of Parliament, Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube, have been repeatedly denied bail and access to their lawyer since they were arrested on specious terrorism charges in July 2021; both parliamentarians remained in detention through year-end 2022.",1,"Despite the 2018 passage of the Police Service Act, which prescribes disciplinary measures for police officers who use illegitimate force, physical abuse of suspects and inmates by law enforcement officials is an ongoing problem, and investigations into such abuse lack independence and transparency. Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube, two prodemocracy parliamentarians arrested during the 2021 crackdown on dissent, were reportedly brutally assaulted by prison security forces in September 2022.The 2021 death of Thabani Nkomonye, a student allegedly killed by police using excessive force, sparked a series of protests against police brutality that evolved into widespread antigovernment demonstrations. Security forces responded to the protests with disproportionate force; at least 200 people were hospitalized and more than 80 were reportedly killed by security forces during the protests. The government’s crackdown on dissent continued in 2022; numerous reports indicate that during the year, security officials shot tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition into crowds of protesters, performed arbitrary arrests, and physically assaulted demonstrators during protests.",0,"Women’s rights remain restricted in law and in practice. Both civil and customary law treat women as dependents of their fathers or husbands, and societal discrimination further impairs their access to education and employment. Residents who are not ethnic Swazis also face de facto discrimination. People with disabilities experience social stigma as well as discrimination in education and employment. In 2018, King Mswati signed the Persons with Disabilities Act, intended to address many of the inequities experienced by disabled residents.Discrimination against LGBT+ people is not prohibited by law and is widespread in practice.

ethiopia,"The judiciary is officially independent, but in practice it is subject to political interference, and judgments rarely deviate from government policy. Ethiopia’s security forces have maintained significant influence over the judicial process, especially in cases against opposition leaders and other political adversaries. Judges who attempt to exercise independence have faced arrests by authorities. Courts remain complicit in ensuring impunity for security forces, especially in relation to the political prisoners.",1,"Due process rights are generally not respected. The right to a fair trial is often not respected, particularly for government critics. In civil matters, due process is hampered by the limited capacity of the Ethiopian courts system, especially in the peripheral regions where access to government services is weak. As a result, routine matters regularly take years to be resolved. Human rights abuses and extrajudicial punishments by security forces occur widely throughout the country, and most security forces who commit the abuses go unpunished.In May 2022, Ethiopian security forces arbitrarily arrested more than 4,500 people in the Amhara region, including journalists and activists, in an attempt to crack down on the Fano militia group that bases its operations there. The government provided no justification for the arrests, and whether the people arrested in May remained in custody at the end of the year was unclear.",0,"Several conflicts have intensified in 2022—most notably in Oromia—but there has also been growing instability in Amhara, Afar, Tigray, and other regions. According to UN figures, as of July 2022, there were 2.72 million internally displaced people across Ethiopia, mostly due to the conflicts. Security forces have been accused of war crimes, including the rape and massacring of civilians. Despite the November peace deal ending the Tigray conflict, which had caused the deaths of an estimated 600,000 people, high risk of mass atrocities in the region remains. Extrajudicial executions and human rights abuses by security forces remain widespread. A report released in September 2022 by the ICHREE implicated the government and its allied forces in crimes against humanity, and claimed the other warring parties in the Tigray conflict had committed war crimes.An ongoing government campaign to suppress armed opposition forces in western Oromia has led to repeated clashes and widespread displacement. According to the ICHREE, in 2022 incidents of large-scale killings targeting ethnic groups increased in Oromia, perpetrated by Amhara militias, the OLA, Oromia Special Forces, and the ENDF. In June and July, hundreds of civilians, mainly ethnic Amhara, were killed in the West Wollega and Kellem Wollega zones of Oromia by armed assailants. Between August and early December, dozens of ethnic Oromo were killed in Horo Guduru and East Wollega zones by militants from the Amhara region, allegedly the Fano.In March 2022, government forces burned a civilian alive in Benishangul Gumuz. In June, at least 50 civilians were extrajudicially executed in Gambella following the offensive against security forces by joint forces from the Gambella Liberation Front (GLF) and OLA.",0,"The ongoing conflict in Oromia, the two years of civil war in Tigray, and political tensions throughout the country have inflamed ethnic divisions, contributing to discriminatory policies and actions against certain groups. Tigrayan, Amhara, and Oromo groups and activists have spoken out about the increasing number of targeted attacks and discrimination they have experienced.

The number of IDPs in Ethiopia surpassed 2.72 million as of July 2022, and humanitarian groups have struggled to meet the growing need.

Same-sex sexual activity is prohibited by law and punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment. Women face discrimination in education.

Fiji has refused entry into the country for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges since 2014.The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, passed by Parliament in February 2021, removed assessors—lay judicial advisors—from trials, leaving verdicts in criminal cases solely to judges.

Hate speech on the internet was also a concern, with targets including immigrants, people of African descent, LGBT+ people, the Jewish community, and Roma. ECRI’s recommendations had not been implemented as of March 2022. From mid-2021 to mid-2022, Finnish authorities appointed a working group to assess the need for reforms to the Non-Discrimination Act. A proposal for strengthening the Non-Discrimination Act was presented to Finland’s parliament in September 2022 and a partial amendment was approved in November.A 2020 report by Finland’s nondiscrimination ombudsman highlighted racism against people of African descent.

The far-right has become increasingly successful in using racist language to shape French public discourse.Women face a notable pay gap, with European Union data showing that men earn 15.8 percent more than women on average in France. Sexual harassment of and violence against women are prominent issues.Migrants and refugees continue to face societal discrimination and abuse from authorities, though Ukrainians fleeing the Russian regime’s invasion of their country have received support. Migrants and aid workers in Calais have faced mistreatment by police; while the Office for Immigration and Integration vowed to better address the needs of people living in informal camps, NGOs reported little improvement in Calais in 2022. In December 2022, the government revealed draft immigration legislation that would, among other things, limit the number of appeals available to rejected asylum seekers and allow authorities to more easily deport foreign-born individuals convicted of crimes. Parliament is expected to debate the bill in 2023.	In September 2022, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the government’s decision not to repatriate French women and children held in Syria violated their rights; the women and children had been affiliated with the Islamic State militant group and were subsequently held in camps in Syria.",3
gabon,"The courts are subordinate to the president. The judiciary is accountable to the Justice Ministry, through which the president has the power to appoint and dismiss judges. Gabon’s highest judicial body, the Constitutional Court, is composed of three members appointed by the president, two by the National Assembly, one by the Senate, and three by the Superior Council of the Judiciary (CSM), which itself is headed by the president and justice minister.The 2018 constitution created a new special court, the Court of Justice of the Republic, which alone has the authority to place a check on top executive and judicial officials. It consists of seven members appointed by the CSM and six members of Parliament. The Constitutional Court is headed by a longtime Bongo ally.",0,"Legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention are not upheld by police, and detainees are often denied access to lawyers. Lengthy pretrial detention is common. Arbitrary arrests linked to opposition activism have increased since the 2016 election crisis. Several detained opposition figures have been denied due process, and prisoners have occasionally died in custody.

gambia,"The Barrow government has taken steps to improve the judiciary, which was hampered by corruption and inefficiency under Jammeh. These steps include ending the use of contract judges, establishing additional courts to address case backlogs, and giving courts greater budgetary autonomy. The government also reconstituted the Judicial Service Commission, which appoints lower-court magistrates and advises the president on higher-level appointments, court efficiency, and operations. While executive dominance remains a concern, the judiciary has shown some independence from the other branches of government in recent years.",2,"Constitutional due process guarantees remain unevenly upheld, though political dissidents face less risk of persecution than during the Jammeh era. The government has pledged to arrest and prosecute security officers responsible for past human rights abuses. In 2022, five former officers from Jammeh’s National Intelligence Agency were sentenced to death for the murder of political activist Ebrima Solo Sandeng in 2016, while two other defendants were acquitted.Other Jammeh-era officials accused of human rights violations and abuses have been suspended in accordance with TRRC recommendations. In the white paper it released in May 2022, the government pledged to prosecute Jammeh in accordance with TRRC recommendations, but did not offer a timeline for doing so. The announcement of a special investigative panel to examine the December 2022 alleged coup attempt has been criticized by some members of civil society for potentially undermining the rule of law.",2,"The use of illegitimate physical force by security agents has been less frequent under the Barrow administration. There have been some attempts to improve prison conditions, which remain dire. The recommendations of the TRRC have yielded several prosecutions and suspensions of security officials for using illegitimate force, and the government has acknowledged the need to strengthen laws protecting individuals from abuse by security services. In March 2022, the escalating conflict in Senegal’s Casamance region displaced around 5,600 Gambians.",2,"Several groups in Gambian society encounter serious difficulties in exercising their human rights. Women enjoy less access to higher education, justice, and employment than men. Legal protections for people with disabilities require strengthening and enforcement. LGBT+ people face severe societal discrimination, and same-sex sexual relations remain criminalized. The constitution prohibits discrimination, but this “does not apply in respect to adoption, marriage, divorce, burial, and devolution of property upon death.” Caste-based discrimination remains an issue in parts of the country.",1
georgia,"Despite ongoing judicial reforms, executive and legislative interference in the courts remains a substantial problem, as does a lack of transparency and professionalism surrounding judicial proceedings. The High Council of Justice nominates Supreme Court judges; whom Parliament then approves. A judicial self-governing body elects most council members. Over the past five years, Supreme Court nominations have featured criticism of opaque processes and allegations of unqualified nominees, and consequent boycotts of confirmation votes by opposition lawmakers. In 2022, two judges considered close to the ruling party were elected to the High Council of Justice, following the sudden resignations of two other members. Their election was criticized by opposition parties as reflecting further capture of the judiciary by a small number of influential judges.",2,"The law guarantees due process, but associated safeguards are not always respected. The ombudsman’s office has reported a failure to fully implement Constitutional Court rulings on due process matters, administrative delays in court proceedings, the violation of the accused’s right to a presumption of innocence, failure to observe rules surrounding detention and interrogation, and the denial of access to a lawyer upon arrest. Multiple government opponents have faced prosecutions in recent years that were widely seen as selective or politically motivated.Former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who had been convicted of abuse of power in absentia in 2018, was arrested by Georgian authorities upon his return to Georgia in October 2021. Saakashvili was prohibited from attending several hearings related to new charges in 2021 and 2022.",2,"Human rights watchdogs and the ombudsman have expressed concern about the physical abuse of detainees during arrest and in police custody, and have noted the lack of an independent system for supervising police conduct and addressing claims of mistreatment. Violence and harsh conditions in prisons remain problems.A 2018 law established the State Inspector’s Service (SIS), which was tasked with investigating police abuses. In December 2021, the government passed legislation to replace the SIS with two entities, which the state inspector described as “punishment of the service for its independence.” Former president Saakashvili faced apparent mistreatment after his October 2021 arrest. Not long after he was detained, the State Penitentiary Service (SPS) released footage of Saakashvili being physically dragged into a prison hospital, apparently against his will.",2,"A 2014 law provides protection against discrimination based on various factors, including race, gender, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity, but it is enforced unevenly.

Transgender people receive little protection, and prosecutors rarely designate crimes against transgender people or other minorities as hate crimes, despite evidence supporting such designations.",2
germany,"The judiciary is independent, and generally enforces the rights provided by Germany’s laws and constitution.",4,"The rule of law prevails in Germany. Civil and criminal matters are treated according to legal provisions and with due process. However, under “preventive detention” practices, those convicted of certain violent crimes can be detained after serving their full sentence if they are deemed to pose a danger to the public.In 2019, the ECJ ruled that German prosecutors were not allowed to issue European arrest warrants because of their dependence on state-level justice ministers. In 2021, the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection (BMJV) proposed a draft law that would strengthen the independence of public prosecutors; as of late 2022, the law had not been passed.The professionalism of law-enforcement officers has come into question following the 2018 discovery of a neo-Nazi network within the Frankfurt police. Since then, police in several cities and states have been accused of espousing extremist and discriminatory sentiments. An investigation into the issue was launched by the federal Ministry of the Interior in October 2020; a May 2022 report noted that investigators uncovered more than 325 cases of far-right extremist activity within Germany’s security forces between July 2018 and July 2021.",4,"Politically motivated crimes against public officials and politicians have increased in recent years. The political establishment was notably shaken by the 2019 murder of Hesse politician Walter Lübcke at the hands of a far-right extremist. In 2021, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) registered 3,889 politically motivated violent crimes, compared to 3,365 in 2020.Attacks on refugees and refugee housing continued to decline from a peak of 3,500 in 2016. According to the Ministry of the Interior, authorities recorded a total of 711 such crimes between January and September 2022, compared to 965 attacks during the same period in 2021.In December 2022, German security services conducted raids in more than 150 locations across the country and arrested 25 people affiliated with the so-called Reichsbürger (Citizens of the Reich) movement, a far-right terrorist group accused of plotting to violently overthrow the government. Investigations into the movement remained ongoing at year’s end.",3,"The constitution guarantees equality and prohibits discrimination based on origin, gender, religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation. However, several obstacles stand in the way of equal treatment of all segments of the population. Race-based discrimination is commonplace, including continued discrimination against Roma and Sinti people. Women’s rights are protected under antidiscrimination laws. However, women face a gender-based pay gap—earning on average 18 percent less per hour than men as of 2021—while men are likelier to hold full-time employment. The differences were significantly higher in West Germany than in East Germany. A law requiring large German companies to reserve at least 30 percent of nonexecutive-board seats for women took effect in 2016, but this law affects a limited number of companies. A similar law went into effect in August 2021, requiring the executive boards of stock market–listed companies to include at least one woman; additionally, if the federal government holds majority ownership of a company, 30 percent of that company’s board seats must be reserved for women. More than one million Ukrainian refugees entered Germany following the Russian military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Refugees and asylum seekers are eligible to receive government services, though in practice such services, including housing and employment support, can be difficult to access. Societal discrimination against migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers is common.New legal guidelines governing blood donation were enacted in 2021, lifting some of the regulations that had previously prevented gay and bisexual men from donating blood. However, LGBT+ activists say that the law still contains discriminatory restrictions. In June 2022, the government announced plans to introduce a new “self-determination law” that would ease regulations restricting the ability of individuals to change their legal name and gender; however, the reforms had not been passed by year’s end.In September 2022, a transgender man died after being violently assaulted during an LGBT+ event in Münster.",3

However, police have been known to accept bribes, make arbitrary arrests, and hold people without charge for longer than the legally permitted limit of 48 hours. The government is not obliged to provide the accused with legal counsel, and many people unable to afford lawyers are forced to represent themselves in court. In July 2022, President Akufo-Addo signed a bill to formally introduce plea bargaining for most criminal offences.",3,"Prisons are overcrowded and conditions can be life threatening, though the prison service has attempted to reduce congestion and improve the treatment of inmates in recent years. While death penalty remains in the statutes, it has rarely been applied and no one has been executed or sentenced to death since 1993. Communal and ethnic violence is known to occur in parts of Ghana. A protracted chieftaincy dispute in Bawku’s upper east region was reignited in September 2022, which resulted in the death of at least three people.",3,"Despite equal rights under the law, women face societal discrimination, especially in rural areas, where their opportunities for education and employment are limited. However, women’s enrollment in universities has been increasing in recent years. People with disabilities face societal discrimination. LGBT+ people face significant discrimination. Same-sex sexual activity remains criminalized, encouraging impunity for violence against and harassment of LGBT+ people. The NGO LGBT+ Rights Ghana, which opened the country’s first LGBT+ community center in January 2021, faced significant opposition from political and religious figures as well as violent threats. The center was raided by security officers in February 2021 and was closed by police later that month. A bill that would limit the rights of LGBT+ people was also considered by Parliament in 2021. In early August, Parliament held its first reading of the Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill, which would criminalize displays of affection and cross-dressing; also as a result of the law, those engaging in certain forms of LGBT+ advocacy could face prison sentences as long as 10 years. In June 2022, a billboard that promoted tolerance of the LGBT+ people was pulled down by Ghanian security forces who were ordered to do so by members of Parliament that sponsored the 2021 bill. The speaker of Parliament stated at a media briefing in November 2022 that a bill criminalizing open expressions of queer identity, as well as for supporting equal rights for LGBT+ people, would pass before the next general elections in 2024.",2

Persistent problems include court backlogs that lead to prolonged pretrial detention as well as improper detention of asylum seekers. In September 2022, the Criminal Court of Appeal acquitted 20 defendants who were accused of money laundering during the signing of a contract with Siemens to digitize the Organization for Telecommunications (OTE). The Criminal Court of Appeal’s verdict overturned a lower court decision from 2019, which had given multiyear sentences to all defendants. The majority of the defendants were being prosecuted for activities committed before 2002, and charges were dropped due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The prosecutor of the Supreme Court ordered a preliminary investigation into individuals who participated in the procedural handling of the case.",3,"While overall rates of violent crime are low, there are occasional acts of politically motivated violence and vandalism by left- or right-wing extremist groups.

Those overseeing high-profile corruption and human rights cases have been removed, transferred or prevented from taking their posts; some have been subjected to threats, faced criminal prosecution, or forced to leave the country. In February 2022, the Supreme Court stripped prominent anticorruption judge Pablo Xitumul of his judicial immunity. Xitumul was subsequently suspended from his post. In May, María Consuelo Porras was reappointed to another four-year term as attorney general in a controversial process. Porras has repeatedly blocked high-profile corruption investigations and weaponized the justice system against prosecutors, lawyers, and judges involved in the fight against corruption. In February, former FECI anticorruption prosecutor Virginia Laparra was arrested on specious charges of “continuous abuse of authority” and placed in preventive detention; Laparra was convicted of the charges in December and given a four-year prison sentence. Corruption has also affected the process to select new Supreme Court and appellate court judges, which has remained stalled since 2019.",1,"Due process rights are guaranteed in the constitution, but those rights are inconsistently upheld, due in part to corruption in the judiciary and an ineffective police force in which many officers routinely violate the law and the rights of citizens.

In 2022, the country’s homicide rate increased for the second year in a row. The police recorded 3,043 homicides during the year, compared to 2,843 in 2021, marking a 7 percent increase. Prison facilities are grossly overcrowded and rife with gang- and drug-related violence and corruption. Prison riots are common and are frequently deadly. Efforts to bring perpetrators of past human rights abuses to justice have been significantly hampered by intimidation campaigns against those involved in the process.

Indigenous communities suffer from high rates of poverty, illiteracy, and infant mortality. Indigenous women are particularly marginalized. Discrimination against the Mayan community is a major concern. LGBT+ people face discrimination, violence, and police abuse and are unprotected by legislation. The PDH has stated that people living with HIV/AIDS also face discrimination. The constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender, but women continue to face gender-based inequality; women are usually paid less for their labor than men, and sexual harassment in the workplace is not penalized.",1

haiti,"The Haitian judiciary faces a multitude of challenges including corruption, safety concerns, a lack of accountability, political interference, and arbitrariness in operations, rendering the justice system ineffective by any standard. As president, Jovenel Moïse made judicial appointments beyond the authority of his office and interfered with judges who investigated politically sensitive matters. In February 2022, the Ministry of Justice attempted to illegally nominate judges to the Supreme Court. Under the constitution, judges sitting on that court must be named by the president from a list provided by the Senate. The Supreme Court last met in February, though Henry appointed a new president for that court in November.After Moïse’s 2021 assassination, a number of judges assigned to the case resigned for security-related reasons. Other officials who were involved in the investigation received death threats. A fifth judge was assigned to the case in May 2022. In its October report to the UN Security Council, the BINUH reported that a legal deadline in the case had nevertheless been missed.Security concerns affected other courts in 2022. In June, gangs took control of the Court of First Instance in Port-au-Prince. Judges and lawyers who fled reported that files were lost during that incident. Lawyers had sought to avoid that court, which is near gang-controlled territory, and called on the government to move it for safety reasons. In its October report, the BINUH noted that police had to patrol the CSCCA after that court received threats.",1,"Constitutionally protected due process rights are regularly violated in practice. Arbitrary arrest is common, as are extortion attempts by police and at all levels of the legal system. Most suspects do not have legal representation, and even those who do suffer from long delays and case mismanagement. In 2021, the BINUH said 82 percent of all detainees were held on a pretrial basis. Many have never appeared before a judge despite the legal requirement of a court hearing within 48 hours of arrest; in some cases, detainees have waited years for a trial.In 2020, President Moïse published two decrees that expanded the definition of terrorism and created the ANI to gather information on and prevent terrorist acts that ostensibly threaten national security. Human rights groups criticized the vague new definition of “terrorist act,” which included robbery, extortion, arson, and the destruction of public and private goods. According to the decrees, the ANI would have broad discretion to conduct searches and surveillance, and its staff cannot be held legally accountable for abuses without prior authorization from the president.",1,"A culture of impunity in law enforcement leaves civilians in Haiti with little protection from the illegitimate use of force, and police themselves are subject to lethal attacks by heavily armed criminal groups.Criminal groups fight one another for territory and prey on residents in areas under their control, earning revenue from kidnappings, extortion, and other illegal activities. In July, the G9 an Fanmi e Alye fought other groups for control of Nan Brooklyn, an area that sits within the Cité Soleil section of Port-au-Prince. In late July, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that some 300 people were killed in the fight for control of that area. In its October report, the BINUH documented 1,377 deaths, injuries, and disappearances between June and September that it blamed on gang activity.

In July 2022, legislators passed a law regarding the Nominating Board for the Supreme Court; some of its provisions established new guidelines for board members and limited some of the discretionary power they enjoy. Critics of the law warned that it still allowed for political influence in judicial selection.

In response to widespread violence, the government of Juan Orlando Hernández empowered the Military Police of Public Order and other security forces to combat security threats, and that policy has continued under President Castro. However, these units often employ excessive force when conducting operations.In 2022, authorities reported a 12.7 percent drop in homicides compared to 2021, but Honduras remained the most dangerous country in Central America based on that figure.

In 2021, the IACHR ruled that the government was responsible for failing to prevent, investigate, and prosecute the 2009 murder of Vicky Hernández, a transgender woman. In May 2022, President Castro publicly accepted the government’s responsibility for Hernández’s death. The IACHR ruling also mandated that the government must allow transgender people to change their gender identity on personal documents and in public records. The administration committed to complying with this requirement but had not done so as of October.Lands inhabited by Indigenous and Afro-Honduran people are particularly vulnerable to expropriation for development projects without adequate prior consultation. Communities that contest such projects are unable to effectively assert their rights. In 2021, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called on the government to release eight human rights activists known as the Guapinol defenders, who had been detained for opposing a mine in a protected national park. Two were acquitted and released in early February 2022, while the Supreme Court ordered the release of the remaining six later that month. In August 2022, the CONADEH reported that over 100 people experienced or were at risk of forced displacement based on complaints it addressed between 2016 and the first half of 2022.",1
hungary,"Judicial independence remains a matter of concern. Eleven judges appointed to the Constitutional Court were named by the Fidesz government, and in 2016 a small opposition party was included in the nomination process for four other judges. Rulings in recent years on politically sensitive cases have favored government interests. High-ranking government officials and progovernment media berate judgments that are detrimental to Fidesz’s interests and regularly launch attacks against judges who publicly speak up against measures threatening judicial independence.The government has also interfered with the administration of the judicial branch in recent years. Significant powers are vested in the president of National Judicial Office (NJO), while the powers of the judicial self-governing body, the National Judicial Council (NJC), which supervises the president of the NJO, are relatively weak. Tünde Handó, former NJO president, was appointed to the Constitutional Court in 2020 and was replaced by György Barna Senyei, another Fidesz ally.In 2019, the government passed an omnibus bill that restricted judicial interpretation of existing case law and allowed members of the Constitutional Court to assume a seat on the Supreme Court without nomination. In October 2020, Constitutional Court justice Zsolt András Varga, who had written several decisions favorable to the government, was elected president of the Supreme Court, despite the NJC’s overwhelming opposition. In addition, administrative authorities were also given the chance to challenge unfavorable rulings directly before the Constitutional Court. In July 2022, the NJC discovered several irregularities in appointments made by the Supreme Court chief justice.In July 2021, a junior judge who had been removed from her position challenged her dismissal through the European Commission, claiming it was politically motivated; she had challenged Hungarian asylum legislation before the CJEU. In November 2021, the CJEU ruled that exposing judges to disciplinary proceedings for referring questions to the EU court is incompatible with EU law and judicial independence.Leaked evidence from a 2022 corruption scandal suggests that high-ranking justice officials have interfered in criminal investigations.",2,"Due process rights are enshrined in the constitution and are generally respected. Litigation costs are relatively high, while access to legal aid is limited. There have been concerns about the quality of lawyers appointed for defendants who are unable or unwilling to retain legal counsel on their own.Hungarian courts have shown some resistance to European judicial oversight on due process matters. In November 2021, the CJEU found that Hungary’s Supreme Court had broken EU law when Prosecutor General Péter Polt in 2019 attempted to limit the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) over a domestic criminal proceeding, in which a lower-level judge sought the ECJ’s opinion on its compliance with EU regulations.In June 2021, the National Assembly passed a measure enabling defendants to claim a compensatory remedy for the excessive length of civil proceedings.",3,"Inadequate medical care and poor sanitation in the country’s prisons and detention centers remain problems. The coronavirus presented further challenges to the safety of prisoners and prison staff. In 2020, the government created new facilities that added significantly more space in prisons and detention centers, bringing prison capacities under 100 percent. However, the prison population has continuously risen due to penal populism and the “tough on crime” stance of the government.Physical abuse by police is a problem, and there are systematic deficiencies in reporting, indicting, investigating, and sanctioning such conduct.",3,"The rights of refugees and asylum seekers are routinely violated in Hungary, where frequent changes to asylum policy—including the uncontestable declaration, by law, of Serbia as a safe third country—and the construction of barriers along the country’s southern border made it nearly impossible for individuals to apply for asylum and receive protection. In the past, asylum seekers were frequently detained in poorly equipped transit zones, and few were recognized by Hungarian authorities as refugees. In 2020, the CJEU ruled that Hungarian asylum procedures were incompatible with EU law and placing asylum seekers in the transit zones constituted unlawful detention. The government subsequently closed the transit zones but passed legislation requiring asylum seekers to present their documentation at diplomatic missions in other countries.Despite EU court rulings, the government has maintained its stance; it continues to train special police units with wide powers to remove migrants from the country. The government has failed to discontinue the practice of “pushbacks,” or the removal of asylum seekers to Serbia, in breach of EU law and in violation of the 2020 CJEU ruling. Consequently, in January 2021, the EU border control agency Frontex suspended its operations in Hungary. While the number of pushbacks peaked in November 2022 at more than 138,000, Prime Minister Orbán encouraged “border hunters,” newly inaugurated in September 2022, to commit mass human right violations, calling for the removal of all migrants from Hungary.While the southern borders are completely shut down to asylum seekers, Hungary has opened its eastern borders for those fleeing Ukraine, reflecting its discriminatory migration policies. Hungary has provided temporary protection status for Ukrainian citizens and their family members fleeing the war; this protection, however, did not cover non-Ukrainians who had legally resided in Ukraine. Human rights NGOs and volunteer groups, not the government, were primarily those who provided aid in the form of accommodation, food, and information for those fleeing their home. While the government described their efforts as the largest ever humanitarian action by the government, only a small percentage of those who arrived in Hungary in 2022 applied for temporary protection.Roma are Hungary’s largest ethnic minority and face widespread discrimination, societal exclusion, violence, and poverty. Roma students continue to be illegally segregated or improperly placed in schools for children with mental disabilities. In early 2020, Prime Minister Orbán launched an anti-Roma campaign in response to a court awarding pecuniary damages to Roma pupils for school segregation in the town of Gyöngyöspata. That year, the National Assembly amended public education laws to prevent courts from awarding pecuniary damages for similar future claims.Women in Hungary are subject to employment discrimination and tend to be underrepresented in high-level business positions.The Fidesz government has been increasingly and openly discriminatory toward many groups, but particularly LGBT+ people. In 2020, the parliament voted to end the legal recognition of gender identity, passed a law that severely restricts same-sex couples’ ability to adopt children, and declared that the legal parents of a child are a woman and a man. Senior Fidesz politicians have made homophobic statements in public, and the government uses anti-LGBT+ rhetoric extensively. A June 2021 law banned the discussion of gender and sexual diversity in schools, the media, advertising, and other public places. The legislation, which conflates pedophilia with homosexuality and expressions of gender identity, was challenged by a European Commission infringement procedure in July. Media and NGOs reported a rise in verbal and physical assaults against LGBT+ people since the 2021 law entered into force.Antisemitism persists in Hungary, and the government’s anti-Soros campaigns pander to individuals with those sentiments. In January 2021, the Equal Treatment Authority—one of Hungary’s most effective institutional mechanisms to fight discrimination—was abolished. Its powers were transferred to the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, whose independence and effectiveness is highly questionable.",2
iceland,"The judiciary is generally independent. Judges are proposed by an Interior Ministry selection committee, are formally appointed by the president, and are not subject to term limits. However, in 2017, former justice minister Sigríður Andersen interfered in the selection process for the Court of Appeals when she selected nominees who were considered unqualified. In 2020, the ECtHR ruled that the government violated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) when a defendant was judged by one of Andersen’s nominees.",4,"The law does not provide for trial by jury, but many trials and appeals use panels of several judges. Prison conditions generally meet international standards.",4,"Police are generally responsive to incidents of violence. War and insurgencies are not a concern. Violent crime is rare, though a slight increase in both gun- and knife-related violence was recorded in 2022. The Minister of Justice announced in December that, for protection from the “growing threat” of weapons-related crime, police would be authorized to carry stun guns.In September 2022, police announced that four men had been arrested for allegedly planning to commit a domestic terrorist attack; two remained in custody until December, when they were released after being indicted on terrorism-related charges.",4,"The constitution states that all people shall be treated equally before the law, regardless of sex, religion, ethnic origin, race, or other status. The Directorate of Immigration has repeatedly been accused of using excessive force in carrying out deportations. In 2019, authorities deported an Albanian family—including a heavily pregnant woman who had received medical certification that she was unfit to fly—even though an appeal against their deportation was still under consideration. In 2022, the decision to deport the woman despite her medical status was deemed illegal, and the state agreed to provide her with financial compensation. In November, an Iraqi family seeking asylum in Iceland was deported to Greece; video footage of the deportation showed one member of the family, who is disabled, being forcibly removed from his wheelchair. The family returned to Iceland in December after a court ruled that their deportation had been illegal. The rate of refugee recognition in Iceland is low compared to other northern European countries. A record number of refugees—totaling approximately 4,000 people—arrived in Iceland during 2022. Although refugees are eligible to receive government services, including housing and employment support, the government sometimes struggled to provide such services in 2022.Immigrants who do not fluently speak Icelandic often face barriers to employment. Until 2019, noncitizens were prohibited from employment in the public sector.",3
india,"The judiciary is formally independent of the political branches of government. Judges, particularly in the Supreme Court, have traditionally displayed autonomy and activism in response to public-interest litigation. However, lower levels of the judiciary suffer from corruption, and the courts have shown signs of increasing politicization. The government has also made judicial appointments that observers consider political in nature.Several key Supreme Court rulings in recent years have been favorable to the BJP, including the 2019 decision allowing the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a historic mosque and a 2020 decision to deny bail to a scholar and prominent critic of Prime Minister Modi who was charged with supporting a banned Maoist group. In 2022, courts continued to issue rulings favoring the BJP, including in highly controversial cases.",2,"Due process rights are not consistently upheld. Citizens face substantial obstacles in the pursuit of justice, including demands for bribes and difficulty getting the police to file a First Information Report, which is necessary to trigger an investigation of an alleged crime. Corruption within the police force remains a problem. The justice system is severely backlogged and understaffed, leading to lengthy pretrial detention for suspects, many of whom remain in jail longer than the duration of any sentence they might receive if convicted.A number of security laws allow detention without charge or based on vaguely defined offenses. The Unlawful Activities Prevention Act has been used extensively in recent years to hold individuals for long periods without trial or specific evidence of guilt.In August 2022, 11 men convicted of crimes against a Muslim family during communal violence in Gujarat in 2002—including gang rape and murder—were released from prison in what was widely regarded as a bid to secure the support of hard-line Hindu voters ahead of the December 2022 state elections.",2,"Torture, abuse, and rape by law enforcement and security officials have been reported. A bill intended to prevent torture remains pending. Abuses by prison staff against people in custody, particularly those belonging to marginalized groups, are common. In July 2022, the Home Affairs Ministry reported that 4,484 people died in judicial or police custody in 2020 and 2021.Security forces battling regional insurgencies continue to be implicated in extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, kidnappings, and destruction of homes. While the criminal procedure code requires that the government approve the prosecution of security personnel, approval is rarely granted, leading to impunity.The Maoist insurgency in the east-central hills region of India continues, though the annual number of casualties linked with it has decreased significantly since peaking in 2010. Among other abuses, the rebels have allegedly imposed illegal taxes, seized food and places of shelter, and engaged in abduction and forced recruitment of children and adults. Local civilians and journalists who are perceived to be progovernment have been attacked. Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the violence and live in government-run camps.Separately, in India’s seven northeastern states, more than 40 insurgent factions—seeking either greater autonomy or complete independence for their ethnic or tribal groups—continue to attack security forces and engage in intertribal violence. Such fighters have been implicated in bombings, killings, abductions, and rapes of civilians, and they operate extensive extortion networks.",2,"The constitution bars discrimination based on caste, and laws set aside quotas in education and government jobs for historically underprivileged scheduled tribes, Dalits, and groups categorized by the government as “other backward classes” and “Economically Weaker Sections.” However, members of these populations face routine discrimination and violence, and the criminal justice system fails to provide equal protection to marginalized groups.In parts of the country, particularly in rural areas, informal community councils issue edicts concerning social customs. Their decisions sometimes result in violence or persecution aimed at those perceived to have transgressed social norms, especially women and members of scheduled castes. Other forms of discrimination faced by women include workplace bias and sexual harassment. Indian participation in the international #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault has raised awareness of the problem, but women have also endured reprisals after reporting cases, and the movement’s reach has largely been limited to the country’s urban middle class.In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of Section 377 of the penal code to ban same-sex intercourse was unconstitutional, and courts have since pressed state and national authorities to combat discrimination against LGBT+ people. Such discrimination continues, however, sometimes including violence and harassment.",2
indonesia,"The judiciary has demonstrated its independence in some cases, particularly in the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. However, the court system remains plagued by corruption and other weaknesses. Judicial decisions can be influenced by religious considerations. Indonesia’s Human Rights Court heard its first case since 2004 in 2022, in which a retired military officer was accused of unlawfully killing Papuan protesters in 2014. The defendant was acquitted in December 2022. Some observers considered the judges’ performance promising, though the lawyer representing victims’ families voiced distrust over the trial.",2,"Police reportedly engage in arbitrary arrests and detentions, particularly of protesters or activists suspected of separatism. Existing safeguards against coerced confessions are ineffective, and defendants are sometimes denied proper access to legal counsel, including in death penalty cases.In 2021, the government began designating Papuan separatists as terrorists under the 2018 antiterrorism law; such individuals had previously faced treason charges under the criminal code. Activists criticized the move, warning it would allow the authorities to hold people without charge for long periods.Aceh Province uses Sharia (Islamic law) to guide punishments and regulations. A number of districts and provinces additionally have unconstitutional Sharia-based ordinances that contradict Indonesia’s international human rights commitments.",1,"Deadly confrontations involving security forces remain common in the Papua region, and have increased in geographic scope, intensity, and frequency since 2018. In 2021, the government designated “armed criminal groups” as terrorist organizations, granting law enforcement greater detention powers and more resources. Military operations intensified that year, after the death of a brigadier general in Papua’s Central Highlands. Security forces have been implicated in torture and extrajudicial killings; six soldiers were accused of killing and mutilating four Indigenous residents of the Papua region in August 2022. Separatists have also targeted security forces and civilians at higher rates. Military personnel accused of crimes against civilians are tried in military courts, which lack impartiality and often impose light punishments, even for serious human rights violations. Torture by law enforcement agencies is not explicitly criminalized.Prisons are overcrowded and corrupt, leading to riots, protests, fires, and jailbreaks. Violence related to natural resource extraction remains a problem. In Aceh, regulations under Sharia permit provincial authorities to use caning as punishment for offenses related to gambling, alcohol consumption, and illicit sexual activity.",1,"Papuans face racial discrimination, including from authorities and political parties. Some national laws and numerous local ordinances discriminate against women either explicitly or in effect. LGBT+ people suffer from widespread discrimination, inflammatory and discriminatory rhetoric from authorities, and attacks by hard-line Islamist groups. Ethnic Chinese, who make up approximately 1 percent of the population, are vulnerable to harassment. Indonesia grants temporary protection to refugees and migrants but is not party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and does not accept refugees for asylum and resettlement. However, 13,700 registered refugees and asylum seekers resided there as of 2022, most of them seeking to travel to their ultimate destination. Those in transit have limited access to health-care services and none for the formal labor market. While the Indonesian government recognizes the principle of nonrefoulement, these individuals are at risk of deportation in practice.",1
iran,"While the courts have a degree of autonomy within the ruling establishment, the judicial system is regularly used as a tool to silence regime critics and opposition members. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the supreme leader for renewable five-year terms. Deputy head Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei was named to the judiciary’s top post in July 2021, succeeding Raisi after he won election as president. Ejei had previously served as an intelligence minister and prosecutor general.Political dissidents and advocates of human and labor rights have continued to face arbitrary judgments, and the security apparatus’s influence over the courts has reportedly grown in recent years.",1,"The authorities routinely violate basic due process standards, particularly in politically sensitive cases. Activists are arrested without warrants, held indefinitely without formal charges, and denied access to legal counsel or any contact with the outside world. Many are later convicted on vague security charges in trials that sometimes last only a few minutes.An estimated 14,000 people were arrested in connection with the antiestablishment protests that began in September 2022, and due process violations were reportedly widespread. More than 40 of the detainees were sentenced to death, and many were reportedly denied access to legal counsel of their choice and were forced to accept state-appointed lawyers who took little action to defend them. Their trials were extremely brief and relied on confessions obtained under duress. At least two of the convicted defendants were known to have been executed by year’s end, and many others awaiting trial faced charges that carried the death penalty.Lawyers who take up the cases of dissidents have been jailed and banned from practicing, and a number have been forced to leave the country to escape prosecution. In 2019, prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was reportedly sentenced to an additional 33 years in prison and 148 lashes for her activities; she had been in prison serving a five-year sentence since mid-2018. In 2020, Sotoudeh was temporarily released amid concerns about her health following a hunger strike; she remained on leave as of late 2022. During the 2022 protests, authorities arrested at least 44 lawyers, including defense attorneys who represented demonstrators. Some of the detained attorneys were also targeted after taking part in protests led by lawyers in Tehran and Shiraz.Earlier in the year, in June 2022, the authorities sentenced five individuals—three lawyers, an activist, and a human rights defender—to prison terms ranging from 95 days to four years on charges of colluding to commit crimes against national security. When they were arrested in 2021, the five had been preparing to file a lawsuit alleging that state officials had mismanaged the COVID-19 pandemic. An appeals court upheld the sentences in August.Dual nationals and those with connections abroad have also faced arbitrary detention, trumped-up charges, and denial of due process rights in recent years. In July 2022, reports emerged that Iranian authorities had been detaining Belgian aid worker Olivier Vandecasteele in isolation for several months, and that his health was deteriorating. In December, it was reported that Vandecasteele had been sentenced to 28 years in prison on dubious espionage and money-laundering charges.",0,"Former detainees have reported being beaten during arrest and subjected to torture until they confess to crimes dictated by their interrogators. Some crimes can be formally punished with lashes in addition to imprisonment or fines. Political prisoners have repeatedly engaged in hunger strikes in recent years to protest mistreatment in custody. In 2021, Amnesty International reported that at least 72 prisoners had died in custody since 2010; most of these deaths were caused by torture, the use of firearms or tear gas, or other ill-treatment.Prisons are overcrowded, and prisoners often complain of poor detention conditions, including denial of medical care. Video recordings taken in Evin prison and distributed in 2021 captured incidents in which prisoners were assaulted or mistreated, along with evidence of overcrowding. Criminal cases against six prison guards were opened as a result of the leaked videos. In October 2022, a series of fires destroyed parts of Evin prison under unclear circumstances, killing at least eight people. Security forces reportedly attacked prisoners who attempted to flee the blazes. Iran has generally been second only to China in the number of executions it carries out, putting hundreds of people to death each year. Convicts can be executed for offenses other than murder, such as drug trafficking, and for crimes they committed when they were younger than 18 years old. Legislation enacted in 2017 significantly increased the quantity of illegal drugs required for a drug-related crime to incur the death penalty, prompting sentence reviews for thousands of death-row inmates. However, the number of executions has increased since Raisi took office as president. According to the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights, more than 500 people were executed during 2022, compared with 333 in 2021 and 267 in 2020.In addition to the violence stemming directly from state repression, the country faces a long-term security threat from terrorist and insurgent groups that recruit among disadvantaged Kurdish, Arab, and Sunni Muslim minority populations.",0,"Women do not receive equal treatment under the law and face widespread discrimination in practice. For example, a woman’s testimony in court is given half the weight of a man’s, and the monetary compensation awarded to a female victim’s family upon her death is half that owed to the family of a male victim.A majority of the population is of Persian ethnicity, and members of ethnic minorities experience various forms of discrimination, including restrictions on the use of their languages. Some provinces with large non-Persian populations remain underdeveloped. Activists campaigning for the rights of ethnic minority groups and greater autonomy for their respective regions have come under pressure from the authorities, and some have been jailed. The Kurdish population played an important role in the 2022 protests triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, who was Kurdish, and the state crackdown was especially heavy in Kurdish areas. Disproportionate numbers of protest-related deaths were also reported in Sistan and Baluchistan Province, where Sunni Muslim, ethnic Baluch residents form a majority. Members of the LGBT+ community face harassment and discrimination, though the problem is underreported due to the criminalized and hidden nature of these groups in Iran. The penal code criminalizes all sexual relations outside of traditional marriage, and Iran is among the few countries where individuals can be put to death for consensual same-sex conduct. In September 2022, a rights group reported that two LGBT+ activists had been sentenced to death for supposedly promoting homosexuality. The judiciary confirmed the sentence but said the case was connected to human trafficking.",1
iraq,"The judiciary in Arab-majority Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan is influenced by corruption, political pressure, violent intimidation and occasional killings, tribal forces, and religious interests. The lines between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches are frequently blurred, and executive interference in the judiciary is widespread. Many Iraqis turn to tribal bodies to settle disputes, even those involving major crimes.",0,"Criminal proceedings in Iraq are deeply flawed. Arbitrary arrests, including arrests without a warrant, are common. Detainees are frequently denied access to lawyers, who when available are often prevented access to crucial public documents. Terrorism cases have been prone to fundamental violations of due process, with human rights groups describing systematic denial of access to counsel and short, summary trials with little evidence that the defendants, who are often allegedly associated with IS, have committed specific crimes.Repeated promises to investigate and prosecute members of Iran-backed militias responsible for a wave of assassinations, assassination attempts, and kidnappings of activists across southern Iraq have largely not been upheld by political leaders. Several named suspects are protected by political parties, and the overwhelming majority of cases remain unsolved. Efforts to locate victims of kidnappings have not successfully obtained the release of those who have disappeared.",0,"The end of large-scale combat with IS significantly improved the security environment in Iraq. Though the organization remained active as a clandestine terrorist group in 2020, it no longer controlled Iraqi territory or civilian populations, and its ability to operate was diminished. Throughout 2021, IS waged an insurgency in rural areas of western and northern Iraq, targeting both civilians and military personnel. The insurgency and the collective punishment policies adopted by the Iraqi Security Forces in response have threatened the physical safety of residents.  Militias have recaptured large swaths of Iraqi territory from IS, but they have also engaged in war crimes such as pillaging, forcible displacement of Sunnis, kidnappings, and torture. Over 600 Sunni men and boys who were kidnapped by the PMF during the recapture of western provinces of Iraq in 2016 have not been heard from since.Turkish military forces have carried out drone strikes, artillery shelling and ground incursions into Iraqi Kurdistan to combat the Kurdistan Workers’ Union (PKK) guerilla group. Data released in 2022 shows that since 2015, the Turkish military has killed at least 98 civilians. Others, including Yazidi civilians, have been displaced en masse in the Kurdistan-Turkey border region.Tensions between Iran and the United States continued to play out on Iraqi soil in 2022, endangering Iraqi citizens and Iranian exiles, particularly in Kurdistan. Starting in late September 2022, the Iranian regime began carrying out and officially claiming responsibility for repeated waves of drone and missile strikes that killed dozens of people, including many civilians, across the Iraqi Kurdistan region.The use of torture to obtain confessions is widespread across Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan, including that of children, and even in death penalty cases. Detainees are often held in harsh, overcrowded conditions, and forced disappearances, particularly of suspected IS fighters, have been reported.",1,"Women face widespread societal bias and discriminatory legal treatment under the law. Sexual harassment in the workplace is prohibited, but victims rarely pursue formal complaints. Same-sex relations are not explicitly prohibited, but people risk violence if they are perceived as members of the LGBT+ community. Police forces, militias, and the family members of LGBT+ people have murdered, kidnapped, tortured, raped, confined, and abused LGBT+ Iraqis in recent years. The state and nonstate perpetrators of such violence have enjoyed impunity, which has rendered reporting such abuse to the authorities futile or even dangerous.

Members of a given ethnic or religious group tend to suffer discrimination or persecution in areas where they represent a minority, leading many to seek safety in other neighborhoods or provinces. People of African descent suffer from high rates of extreme poverty and discrimination.",0
ireland,"Ireland has a generally independent judiciary and a legal system based on common law. The Judicial Council, a body which promotes judicial excellence, good conduct, and judicial independence, began operating in 2020 and adopted judicial conduct and ethics guidelines in February 2022.",4,"Due process generally prevails in civil and criminal matters. However, the police force has been affected by repeated corruption scandals in recent years. A Special Criminal Court (SCC) has functioned since 1972 to hear cases related to paramilitary violence committed during the period of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) has called for the SCC’s abolition, noting that it does not employ a jury and can consider secret evidence, as has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC).",4,"Irish prisons and detention facilities are frequently dangerous, unsanitary, overcrowded, and ill-equipped for prisoners with mental illness. In its most recent annual report, published in September 2022, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons reported that COVID-19-related periods of isolation negatively affected prisoners via a lack of family contact and limited access to rehabilitation and educational services. A prisoner died in August 2022 following an attack by a group of inmates at Dublin’s Mountjoy Prison. The killing was investigated by the Irish Prison Service and An Garda Síochána, and in November four prisoners were arrested in the case.A series of official inquiries in recent years have detailed decades of past physical, sexual, and emotional abuse—including forced labor—of women and children in state institutions and by Catholic priests and nuns from the early 20th century until 1996, as well as collusion to hide the abuse. The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes reported “appalling level[s] of infant mortality” and discrimination against residents when it published its final report in January 2021. Then Taoiseach Martin offered an official apology that month. An €800-million ($950-million) redress scheme for survivors was announced in November 2021, but 24,000 survivors who spent less than six months in homes or were “boarded out” were excluded. In 2022, both the Children’s Committee of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) and the UN Human Rights Committee called on the government to remove this exemption. ",3,"While existing legislation bans hate speech, Ireland lacks comprehensive hate-crime laws, and NGOs have criticized existing laws as dated and ineffective. The government proposed much-anticipated legislation in April 2021, which was working its way through parliament at the end of 2022.Supranational bodies have criticized ethnic discrimination within Ireland. In 2020, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights reported that two-thirds of Irish Travellers and Roma face discrimination. The CoE called a 2017–21 inclusion strategy for both groups ineffective in a 2019 report. A 2020 survey of Gardaí (police officers) revealed that not a single respondent had a favorable view of the Traveller community. Another study released in June 2022 alleged institutional racism against Travellers within the force.A new action plan to widen Traveller and Roma participation in higher education was announced in 2022, with the detailed plan published in August. In July 2022, the UN Human Rights Committee urged the government to develop further specific action plans on Traveller and Roma mental health, employment, and enterprise.People with disabilities face housing issues, are persistently institutionalized, and have suffered a severe reduction of social benefits in recent years. The 2021 Annual Report from the IHREC, released in July 2022, showed that the most common reason that people contacted the commission related to services and employment was to raise concerns about disability discrimination.Irish law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, but some social stigma against LGBT+ people persists. Several alleged hate crimes against members of the LGBT+ community took place in 2022. They included the murders of two men in their Sligo homes in separate incidents in April 2022, and an apparent homophobic assault on a man in Dublin the same month.The asylum application process is complex, and asylum seekers can be housed for lengthy periods in poor living conditions in a system known as Direct Provision. In February 2021, the government published a white paper on replacing Direct Provision with a new model by the end of 2023.The 2015 International Protection Law expedites asylum procedures but focuses on enabling deportations rather than identifying and processing cases. In a July 2021 report, the Irish Refugee Council highlighted extensive delays for protection-process applicants.Discrimination in the workplace on the basis of gender is illegal, though there is still a substantial gender pay gap.",3
israel,"The judiciary is independent and regularly rules against the government. The Supreme Court has historically played a crucial role in protecting minority groups and overturning decisions by the government and the parliament when they threaten human rights. The court hears direct petitions from citizens and other individuals in Israel as well as Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the state generally adheres to court rulings.Some right-wing politicians have advocated reforms that would allow the Knesset to override the Supreme Court when it strikes down legislation. Lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected such a bill in 2020.",4,"Although due process is largely guaranteed in ordinary cases, those suspected of security-related offenses are subject to special legal provisions. Individuals can be held in administrative detention without trial for renewable six-month terms. According to human rights groups, at the end of 2022, more than 4,600 Palestinians from the occupied territories were being held in Israeli facilities on security grounds, including over 860 in administrative detention—the greatest number of administrative detainees since 2008. As of August 2022, all administrative detainees were Palestinians, 11 of whom held Israeli citizenship. The Supreme Court almost never grants attorneys’ requests to void administrative detention orders. Under criminal law, individuals suspected of security offenses can be held for up to 96 hours without judicial review under certain circumstances, and be denied access to an attorney for up to 21 days.Scores of Palestinian children (aged 12–17) from the occupied territories are held in Israeli military detention. Although Israeli law prohibits the detention of children younger than 12, some are occasionally held. Most Palestinian child detainees are serving sentences—handed down by a special military court for minors created in 2009—for throwing stones or other projectiles at Israeli troops in the West Bank; acquittals on such charges are very rare, and the military courts have been criticized for a lack of due process protections. East Jerusalem Palestinian minors are tried in Israeli civilian juvenile courts.",3,"Israeli border communities receive occasional rocket and artillery fire from militant groups in the Gaza Strip, and more rarely from Lebanon and Syria. In August 2022, several Israeli communities were targeted with rockets fired from Gaza by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), which is designated as a terrorist group by the United States, after Israeli forces assassinated a number of the group’s top commanders.  Most rockets in recent conflicts have been intercepted by the Israeli military due to the use of air defense systems, preventing harm to civilians. Israeli security forces and civilians also face the ongoing threat of small-scale terrorist attacks, most often involving stabbings or vehicular assaults. In 2022, 31 Israeli citizens were killed in Palestinian militant attacks in Israel and the West Bank, according to Israeli NGO Rescue Without Borders. Human rights groups have sometimes accused police of using deadly force against stone throwers or perpetrators of stabbing and vehicular attacks.According to the Abraham Initiatives, an Israeli interfaith NGO, roughly 120 murders were recorded in Arab communities in Israel during 2022. Arabs account for the vast majority of murder victims each year despite representing about a fifth of the population, and police are far less likely to solve murders with Arab as opposed to Jewish victims. As part of a coordinated government response to the problem, 2021 budget legislation included new spending on socioeconomic development and law enforcement in Arab communities, and the domestic intelligence service was deployed to help combat criminal activity, drawing mixed reactions from Arab politicians and activists.The Supreme Court banned torture in a 1999 ruling, but said physical coercion might be permissible during interrogations in cases involving an imminent threat. Human rights organizations accuse the authorities of continuing to use some forms of physical abuse and other measures such as isolation, sleep deprivation, psychological threats and pressure, painful binding, and humiliation.",2,"Jewish citizens of Israel, particularly those of Ashkenazi descent, typically enjoy practical advantages relative to the rest of the population on matters including legal treatment and socioeconomic conditions.Arab or Palestinian citizens of Israel face de facto discrimination in education, social services, personal security, and access to housing and related permits. The 2018 nation-state law downgraded Arabic from an official language of the country to a language with “special status,” while another clause states that the change would not “affect the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into force,” suggesting that it would be a largely symbolic demotion. The 2018 nation-state law also declared that the state “views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value, and shall act to encourage and promote its establishment and strengthening.” The Jewish National Fund (JNF-KKL), which owns about 13 percent of the land in Israel, has effectively maintained a Jewish-only land-leasing policy. In December 2022, the newly formed coalition government presented its platform to the Knesset, which included a declaration that “the Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all parts of the Land of Israel,” a designation that is commonly understood to refer to territory outside of the official Israeli state, including the West Bank. Many of Israel’s Bedouin citizens live in towns and villages that are not recognized by the state. Those in unrecognized villages cannot claim social services, are in some cases off the electricity and water grids, and have no official land rights. The government routinely demolishes their structures build without a license.Israelis of Ethiopian origin suffer from discrimination—including in the criminal justice system—and lag behind the general population economically despite government integration efforts.Women are treated equally in criminal and civil courts and have achieved substantial parity within Israeli society, though economic and other forms of discrimination persist, particularly among Arab and religious Jewish communities. Religious courts that rule on family law cases systematically discriminate against women. Arab women are far less likely to be employed than either Arab men or Jewish women.Discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal, though LGBT+ people continue to face bias in some communities. Gay and transgender Israelis are permitted to serve openly in the military.Individuals who enter the country irregularly, including asylum seekers, can be detained for up to a year without charges. Asylum applications, when fully processed, are rejected in over 99 percent of cases. Appeals of these decisions are handled by the Appeals Tribunal, a specialized immigration court that overwhelmingly issues rulings in line with the government’s position. In recent years, authorities have pressured thousands of African asylum seekers who entered the country irregularly—mostly from Eritrea and Sudan—to agree to be deported to a third country, such as Rwanda or Uganda. There have been few new irregular entries since a barrier along the border with Egypt was completed in 2012, though there were more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country as of 2022.",2
italy,"The judiciary is generally independent and autonomous. Allegations of abuse of power and corruption involving members of the High Council of the Judiciary, which controls internal governance of the judiciary, have led to reform. In June 2022, a new law was adopted aimed at reforming aspects of the judicial system such as the “revolving door” between judgeships and other elected public offices. The law also introduced stricter performance evaluation of judges and prosecutors and new rules for the composition of the High Council. Organized crime networks continue to threaten judges and prosecutors involved in antimafia processes, particularly in Calabria, but state protection measures function adequately.",4,"Due process rights are largely upheld. However, judicial procedures are often characterized by lengthy delays; Italy has one of the lowest numbers of judges per capita in the EU. The government has been criticized for denying detained migrants access to lawyers. Recent criminal justice reforms include a requirement that initial appeals be resolved within two years, measures to accelerate the digitalization of the justice system, incentives for the use of restorative justice measures, and time limits for the preliminary hearing stage of cases.",3,"While the population is generally free from major threats to physical security, there have been reports of excessive use of force by police and prison guards, particularly against undocumented migrants. Asylum seekers and undocumented migrants have been held in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions.",3,"The law prohibits discrimination based on gender, race, and sexual orientation, among other categories, and these protections are generally enforced. However, members of the Romany minority have unequal access to housing, and many live in segregated settlements that lack adequate infrastructure. LGBT+ people face societal discrimination and occasional acts of violence, and there are not effective measures protecting them from hate speech and hate crimes.Italy’s treatment of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers has been subject to significant criticism in recent years. In late 2018, parliament approved legal changes that tightened conditions for granting asylum and humanitarian protection, reduced access to services, and eased deportation conditions. A decree enacted in October 2020 allows migrants and refugees to apply for residency on humanitarian protection grounds if they “risk being subjected to torture or inhumane treatment” at home and expands access to public services, but does not offer regularized status to those who lost legal residency under the 2018 decrees.",3
jamaica,"Judicial independence is constitutionally guaranteed. While the judiciary is widely considered independent, corruption remains a problem in some lower courts.",4,"A large backlog of cases and a shortage of court staff continue to undermine the justice system. The vast majority of arrests are made without a warrant, detainees frequently lack access to legal counsel, and trials are often delayed for many years or dismissed due to systemic failures. A 2017 law increased avenues for the resolution of cases outside trial; some defendants have reportedly been unwilling to consider plea deals since its passage.In October 2022, a new Bail Act, which would reduce the number of individuals on remand through the use of electronic tracking, was tabled in Parliament. A parliamentary committee was reviewing the bill as of December.",2,"Killings by police remain a serious problem in Jamaica. According to the government’s Independent Commission of Investigations, 164 people died in incidents involving security personnel in 2022. Prosecutions for illegal killings by security officers are rare. In September, Jamaica’s security minister was criticized for saying police officers should shoot to kill if defending themselves.Jamaica has one of the highest homicide rates in the Americas. The police reported 1,498 murders in 2022, a slight increase over the 1,474 reported in 2021. The country is a transit point for cocaine; much of the country’s violence, particularly in Kingston, is the result of warfare between drug-trafficking gangs. Vigilantism is also a major concern. Many initiatives to address the problem have been undertaken, but crime and violence are deeply entrenched.States of emergency, which provide expanded authority to security forces, are frequently imposed in response to localized spikes in violence. A new Firearms Act, which took effect in November 2022, increased penalties for the illegal possession of firearms and reformed the regime on their use, handling, sale, and management. That same month, the government offered a brief amnesty for those surrendering illegal or unregistered weapons or ammunition.",2,"Harassment and violence targeting LGBT+ people remain major concerns, and such instances are frequently ignored by the police. Anti-LGBT+ discrimination is pervasive, though some politicians have spoken out in support of LGBT+ rights.Article 76 of the colonial-era Offences against the Person Act (OPA) criminalizes the act of buggery; men engaging in same-sex acts could be punished with hard labor lasting as long as 10 years. In 2014, the government expanded the OPA to criminalize the promotion of violence against any category of persons, including LGBT+ individuals, via audio or visual materials. In a nonbinding 2021 ruling, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights called on Kingston to repeal parts of the OPA that criminalize same-sex relations, but the justice minister rejected that ruling.In 2020, the government accepted several proposals made by the UN Human Rights Council, including new antidiscrimination policies and improving investigations into cases of violence against LGBT+ people.Women enjoy the same legal rights as men but suffer employment discrimination and are often paid less for the same work. Acceptance of Rastafarians is increasing, but discrimination persists, particularly in schools.",1
japan,"Japan’s judiciary is independent, and judges cannot be removed arbitrarily. Japanese citizens may remove individual Supreme Court judges through a majority vote in periodic reviews that coincide with parliamentary elections. In November 2022, in compliance with a Supreme Court ruling that May, the Diet adopted legislation that allows Japanese citizens living abroad to participate in these national votes.For serious criminal cases, a judicial panel composed of professional judges and saiban-in (lay judges), selected from the general public, render verdicts.",4,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are generally upheld. However, observers have argued that trials often favor the prosecution. There are reports that suspects have been detained on flimsy evidence, arrested multiple times for the same alleged crime, or subjected to lengthy interrogations that yield what amount to forced confessions. Police can detain suspects for up to 23 days without charge. Access to those in pretrial detention is sometimes limited.",4,"People in Japan are generally protected from the illegitimate use of physical force and the threat of war and insurgencies. Violent crime rates are low. However, organized crime is fairly prominent, particularly in the construction and nightlife sectors; crime groups also run drug-trafficking and loan-sharking operations. Prisoners who face death sentences or are accused of crimes that could carry the death penalty are held in solitary confinement, sometimes for years at a time. There are frequent reports of substandard medical care in prisons. One person was executed in 2022, having been convicted of multiple murders.",4,"Societal discrimination against foreigners and various minority groups has generally declined over time, but it can affect access to housing and employment.A law adopted in 2016 was intended to eliminate discrimination against Japan’s estimated three million burakumin—descendants of feudal-era outcasts. The law obliges national and local governments to provide advice, support, and education on the issue, but it does not assign penalties for acts of discrimination.A 2019 law officially recognized the Ainu as an Indigenous people of Japan, though critics noted that it failed to offer an apology for past mistreatment. Japan-born descendants of colonial subjects (particularly ethnic Koreans and Chinese) also experience discrimination. A 2016 hate speech law calls on the government to take steps to eliminate discriminatory speech against ethnic minorities, but it does not carry any penalties for perpetrators.LGBT+ people face social stigma and in some cases harassment. There is no national law barring discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2016, sexual harassment regulations for national public officials were modified to prohibit harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Employment discrimination and sexual harassment against women are common. Asylum is granted to less than 1 percent of those who apply each year under Japan’s strict screening process, and very few refugees are accepted for third-country resettlement in Japan. Soon after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Japanese government agreed to accept friends and relatives of the 1,900 Ukrainians already residing in Japan, designating the newcomers as “evacuees” with temporary residency and work permits. There were more than 2,000 such individuals in the country by year’s end.",3
jordan,"The judiciary’s independence is limited. The king unilaterally appoints the entire Constitutional Court and the chair of the Judicial Council, which nominates civil court judges and is mostly comprised of senior judiciary members. Judges of both the civil and the Sharia (Islamic law) courts—which handle personal status matters for Muslims—are formally appointed by royal decree. Constitutional amendments in 2022 gave the king sole authority over appointing the chief judge of the religious courts and the president of the council that administers them. The Ministry of Justice monitors judges, promotes them, and determines their salaries, further weakening the branch’s autonomy. However, de facto instances of judicial independence and citizens successfully pushing back against state actors in court cases are not uncommon.",2,"Police can hold suspects for up to six months without filing formal charges, and governors are empowered to impose administrative detention for up to one year. In practice, authorities often ignore procedural safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention, holding individuals incommunicado or beyond legal time limits. Criminal defendants generally lack access to counsel before trial, impairing their ability to mount a defense. Despite a constitutional prohibition, courts allegedly accept confessions extracted under torture.",1,"Torture and other mistreatment in custody are common and rarely draw serious penalties. Prison conditions are generally poor, and inmates reportedly suffer from beatings and other abuse by guards. Terrorist attacks remain a threat to physical security.",2,"Women face discrimination in law and practice. Discrimination against LGBT+ people is prevalent and includes the threat of violence. Authorities have denied registration to NGOs that support equal rights for LGBT+ people.Refugees and asylum seekers do not routinely receive permanent settlement in Jordan, though individuals residing in the country are usually allowed to remain while UN agencies seek their placement in third countries. Refugees often lack access to work permits and work informally. Syrian refugees have at times been forcibly transferred to areas where they are at risk of refoulement, which would place them at risk of torture, rape, and physical violence.The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) counted 762,687 refugees and asylum seekers in Jordan representing the second highest refugee per capita share in the world as of October 2022. Syrians make up 676,621 of these. The government, which claims to host nearly double that number, agreed to issue 200,000 work permits in return for a loan-and-investment package in a 2016 compact. In 2018, it prohibited refugees from accessing subsidized health care. Only one in four Syrian refugee children is enrolled in school by the secondary level and many non-Syrian refugees and asylum seeker children are prevented from enrolling in school altogether. Jordanians of Palestinian origin who are citizens risk the arbitrary revocation of citizenship or documentation and are often excluded from jobs in the public sector and security forces, which are dominated by East Bank tribes.",2
kazakhstan,"The judiciary is effectively subservient to the executive branch, with the president nominating or directly appointing judges based on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council, which is itself appointed by the president. Judges are subject to political influence, and corruption is a problem throughout the judicial system. Attorneys are required to become members of a state chamber and to register with a government-controlled digital information system. Local and international lawyers’ associations have criticized the law, saying it imposes undue state control over legal professionals and threatens their independence.",1,"Police reportedly engage in arbitrary arrests and detentions and violate detained suspects’ right to assistance from a defense lawyer. Prosecutors, as opposed to judges, are empowered to authorize searches and seizures. Defendants are often held in pretrial detention for long periods. Politically motivated prosecutions and prison sentences against activists, journalists, and opposition figures are common. Security forces illegally detained, tortured, and denied legal representation to hundreds of peaceful protesters in January 2022.",1,"Conditions in pretrial detention facilities and prisons are harsh. According to reports by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), the number of suicides among prisoners has increased in recent years; at least one inmate died by suicide in 2021, and several others deliberately injured themselves in protest of prison conditions.Police regularly use excessive force during arrests, and torture is widely employed to obtain confessions, with numerous allegations of physical abuse and other mistreatment documented each year. Many reports claimed that activists detained during the January 2022 protests were beaten and tortured, including famous Kyrgyz jazz pianist, Vikram Ruzakhunov, who was detained, beaten and tortured by law enforcement agents and forced to falsely claim on television that he had been recruited and paid by a criminal group to participate in the violence. There were also reports of detainees having been tortured to death while in custody.Terrorist violence within the country is rare, though some Kazakhstanis have traveled abroad to support the Islamic State (IS) militant group.",1,"While the constitution guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination based on gender, race, and other categories, it does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Major segments of society face discrimination in practice, particularly ethnic minority groups and migrant workers, who are often working without documentation and are frequently exploited. Traditional cultural biases limit economic and professional opportunities for women, and the law offers no protection against sexual harassment in the workplace. Members of the sizable Russian-speaking minority have complained of discrimination in employment and education.LGBT+ people continue to face societal discrimination, harassment, and violence, despite the decriminalization of same-sex relations in 1998. In June 2022, a petition appeared online appealing to the minister of information to ban materials depicting LGBT+ people. The Minister of Culture and Sport, Dauren Abayev, banned the Disney film Buzz Lightyear in July because it featured a kiss between two female characters.Under pressure from Beijing, the Kazakhstan government at times detains ethnic Kazakhs fleeing neighboring China and threatens them with the prospect of deportation, even though they are subject to discrimination and torture upon return. Ahead of President Xi Jinping’s visit to Kazakhstan, Kazakh authorities detained relatives of Kazakhs held in internment camps in Xinjiang protesting for the release of their family members.Russians migrating to Kazakhstan to escape the conscription laws in Russia have experienced some pushback. Activists were detained for protesting against Russians entering the country, while others were arrested for protesting against Russian war atrocities in Bucha.",1
kenya,"While judicial procedures are inefficient, the Kenyan judiciary is generally considered to be independent, and the courts have demonstrated this independence through a series of high-profile rulings in recent years. In September 2022, the Supreme Court ruled against the incumbent government to unanimously uphold the results of the presidential election, bolstering its role as the independent final arbiter of electoral disputes. Likewise, the August 2021 Court of Appeals ruling on the BBI bill’s constitutionality was widely considered a victory for judicial independence; the Supreme Court upheld the ruling in March 2022.Nevertheless, the government has occasionally refused to comply with court orders and has ignored the recommendations of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). In 2019, then president Kenyatta initially refused to appoint 41 judges recommended by the JSC, citing integrity concerns; he later appointed 34 of them, and in September 2022, newly elected president Ruto appointed another 6. ",3,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are poorly upheld. There remains a significant backlog of court cases. Government figures released in late 2022 indicated that the number of cases pending before the courts had reached a six-year high. For the year ending June 2021, there were 649,112 pending cases, with 375,671 classified as backlogged.The police service is thoroughly undermined by corruption, misconduct, and reports of extrajudicial killings. Although Parliament established the IPOA in 2011, the agency’s work secured the conviction of only 17 officers through 2021, out of more than 20,000 complaints and nearly 3,500 investigations.",1,"Following their 2019 terrorist attack on the DusitD2 complex in Nairobi, which killed over 20 people, Shabaab has continued to pose a security threat, with militants threatening to continue attacks until Kenyan troops withdraw from Somalia. According to the Kenya-based Centre for Human Rights and Policy Studies, Shabaab militants committed 77 attacks in 2022, injuring numerous people and killing 117.Severe drought has exacerbated violent conflict in the north and east, with local NGOs calling for a stronger government response to alleviate hunger and reduce the pressures that drive conflict. Food shortages were further exacerbated following the Russian military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which resulted in a sharp decrease in food imports from the region.Violence against suspects and detainees by security forces remains a serious concern, and abuses are rarely punished. Extrajudicial killings are more prevalent in low-income areas in Nairobi. In January 2022, police began an investigation following the discovery of at least 39 bodies in the River Yala in recent years; some of the deceased appeared to have been tortured. Though the investigation was ongoing throughout 2022, President Ruto publicly attributed the deaths to Kenya’s Special Service Unit (SSU), an “elite” police unit implicated in numerous forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. In October, Ruto dissolved the SSU; the same month, several officers were charged in the disappearances of two Indian nationals who worked for Ruto’s campaign.",1,"Consensual same-sex sexual activity is criminalized, with a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. LGBT+ people face discrimination, abuse, and violent attacks. In April 2022, six men raped and murdered Sheila Lumumba, a lesbian woman. At least one person was arrested and charged in relation to Lumumba’s murder by year’s end.In July, the government enacted the Children Act 2022, which provides intersex children with legal recognition and equal access to services.Reports of police abuses against refugees and asylum seekers continue. Somali Kenyans are often stereotyped as refugees and terrorists—a misconception exacerbated by Shabaab attacks in Kenya since the 2010s—and have been targeted by government crackdowns as a result. Coastal communities have long experienced government underinvestment and political marginalization, resulting in worse educational, health, and economic outcomes in the region.",1
kiribati,"The judicial system is modeled on English common law, and historically the courts have been independent. The chief justice is appointed by the president on the advice of the cabinet and the Public Service Commission (PSC); other High Court judges are appointed by the president on the advice of the chief justice and the PSC. Judges cannot be removed unless a special tribunal and the legislature find evidence of misbehavior, or an inability to perform their functions.However, beginning in 2020, the government sought to prevent High Court judge David Lambourne—an Australian who was stranded in his home country for a time due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions—from returning to his post by refusing to issue him a work permit and declining to pay his wages. His wife, Tessie Lambourne, had become leader of the parliamentary opposition that year. Lambourne agreed to sign a contract that effectively shortened his appointment, but sued the attorney general in August 2021 after Tarawa again halted wage payments. In November 2021, High Court chief justice William Hastings, a New Zealander, ruled that the government’s actions were unconstitutional, instructing the authorities to facilitate Lambourne’s return and declaring that he held a life appointment to the court.In May 2022, the president suspended Lambourne from the High Court over public comments that were critical of the government and appointed a tribunal to investigate his alleged misconduct. Lambourne filed an appeal of his suspension, to be heard by Hastings, but Hastings was himself suspended in July, also for public comments that were critical of the government. In August, after Lambourne had returned to Kiribati, the government attempted to forcibly deport him, but Fiji Airways refused to transport the judge against his will. After being briefly held in immigration detention, he was released on bail. In September, after three other New Zealander judges sitting as a Court of Appeal ruled against the attempted deportation, the government suspended them as well, leaving the country without any judges above the magistrate level. In October, Kiribati’s attorney general, Tetiro Semilota, was appointed acting chief justice. Since Semilota had been an ex officio member of the cabinet, her appointment intensified concerns about judicial independence and the rule of law.",2,"Due process guarantees are typically respected during arrests, initial detentions, and trials. Detainees have access to lawyers, and defendants are usually granted bail while awaiting trial.",4,"Police brutality is uncommon, and procedures for punishing such abuse are effective.

Askarov, who was tortured in detention, remained imprisoned despite his deteriorating health and repeated calls for his release.

Destruction of homes and property in both Kyrgyz and Tajik majority villages led to popular mobilization of ad-hoc citizen self-defense groups and intense ethnic tensions. The dispute between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan continued in 2022, leading to several dozen more deaths and displacing more than 100,000 people in multiple outbreaks of violence. In September, another cease fire immediately collapsed; Kyrgyzstan claimed Tajikistan’s military used missiles and artillery on civilian areas, killing more than 20 people and injuring nearly 100, with injuries and a death reported among Tajikistani civilians as well.",1,"Legal bans on gender discrimination in the workplace are not effectively enforced.

Although the functioning of the court system had been gradually improving, it was still hampered by corruption and inefficiency, and defendants with adequate resources have exploited these weaknesses to delay or obstruct prosecutions.Criminal suspects are sometimes interrogated without the presence of a lawyer, and lengthy or unnecessary pretrial detention remains a concern.",3,"Latvia’s residents are generally free from major threats to physical security, though the country has comparatively high levels of violent crime by EU standards. According to the latest Eurostat data, as of 2020, Latvia still has the highest homicide rate, particularly of women, in the EU. Latvia also has one of the EU’s higher incarceration rates. Some prison facilities reportedly suffer from poor physical conditions and episodes of violence.",3,"The constitution guarantees equality before the law and the protection of human rights without discrimination, and several safeguards are specified in law. However, state language policies discriminate against ethnic minority groups in education, employment, and access to services.Women continue to suffer from a gender-based pay gap in practice, and Roma in Latvia face discrimination in schools and workplaces. Discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation is prohibited, but the law does not provide broader protection against discrimination for LGBT+ people. In August 2021, authorities declared a state of emergency after a growing number of migrants and asylum seekers from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere attempted to enter Latvia from Belarus. The government subsequently authorized the use of militarized “pushback” measures, preventing many legitimate refugees and asylum seekers with incomplete paperwork from entering the country. Between August 2021 and November 2022, up to 8,000 people were prevented from crossing into Latvia.",2
lebanon,"Lebanon’s judiciary is not independent. Political leaders exercise significant influence over judicial appointments, jurisdiction, processes, and decisions, which are also affected by corruption and the undue influence of other prominent people.Hezbollah and its political allies have repeatedly sought to replace the judge leading the investigation into the 2020 Beirut port explosion. Former officials implicated in the case secured a 2021 court ruling that removed the first judge, Fadi Sawan, for potential bias. The same political forces accused his replacement, Tarek Bitar, of bias, boycotted government meetings over the issue, and persuaded supporters to protest against him. Defendants and suspects filed multiple legal challenges seeking Bitar’s recusal that delayed the investigation throughout 2022. The Court of Cassation, which is responsible for adjudicating such challenges, lacked a quorum during the year, apparently because government ministers withheld their approval for appointments to fill the court vacancies.",1,"Due process is subject to a number of impediments, including violations of defendants’ right to counsel and extensive use of lengthy pretrial detention. Due process guarantees are particularly inadequate in the country’s exceptional courts, including the military courts, whose judges do not require a background in law and are authorized to try civilians and juveniles in security-related cases. In practice, military courts have asserted jurisdiction over cases involving human rights activists and protesters in addition to those focused on alleged spies and militants.",1,"Residents of southern Lebanon have lived with the risk of land-mine detonation since the 1975–90 civil war, and armed militias, terrorist groups, and criminal organizations continue to undermine security in the country. Authorities reported at least 64 shooting incidents in the first half of 2022, including clashes linked to personal or familial disputes, resulting in the deaths of 26 people and the injury of 73 others. Also during the year, there were more than two dozen incidents in which bank depositors used the threat of violence to withdraw their savings in defiance of strict limits on the size of withdrawals. Depositors’ associations and activist lawyers offered support to the perpetrators in some cases, arguing that they were only retrieving their own money.The organizers of past political violence generally enjoy impunity. In March 2022, an appellate panel of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, based in the Netherlands, convicted two Hezbollah operatives in absentia of involvement in the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. They were then sentenced to life imprisonment in June, but as with another suspect who was convicted in absentia in 2020, their whereabouts remained unknown.Prisons and detention centers are badly overcrowded and poorly equipped, and the use of torture by law enforcement, military, and state security personnel continues despite the passage of antitorture legislation and the creation of institutional mechanisms to halt the practice.",2,"The country’s legal system is meant to protect members of recognized confessional communities against mistreatment by the state, but groups have engaged in discriminatory behavior toward one another in practice, and people who do not belong to a recognized community have difficulty obtaining official documents, government jobs, and other services.Women face discrimination in wages, benefits, and societal standards and practices, and they are barred from certain types of employment.LGBT+ people face both official and societal discrimination and harassment. A criminal code provision barring same-sex sexual relations remains in force, and people who violate this law risk a one-year prison sentence.More than 1.5 million Syrians resided in Lebanon as of 2022. However, only about 830,000 were officially registered as refugees by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as the government has barred the agency from registering new Syrian refugees since 2015. Syrian refugees have faced arbitrary arrests and other forms of harassment, and most live in poverty due in part to limitations on their employment options. The government has also enforced housing regulations to compel Syrian refugees to destroy their informal camps. Syrians have sometimes been deported or forced to sign repatriation agreements despite the risk of mistreatment by Syrian authorities, and the government has promoted plans to facilitate large-scale “voluntary” repatriations that could amount to illegal refoulement in practice.About 479,000 Palestinian refugees are registered in Lebanon, though fewer than 200,000 actually live there. Many reside in 12 designated refugee camps and are restricted from 39 professions, contributing to widespread poverty, unemployment, and underemployment. In 2019, Lebanese authorities issued new regulations requiring foreigners to possess work permits, further restricting Palestinians’ access to the labor market.",1
lesotho,"The constitution protects judicial independence, but according to a 2020 Lesotho Times report, the judicial system was on the verge of collapse due to a lack of funds and infrastructural disrepair. The judicial appointment process lacks full transparency, and members of the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) at times act without proper oversight. However, the JSC conducted public interviews of judicial candidates in February 2022, and in March, seven new judges were finally appointed to the High Court following funding-related delays in 2021.Judges do rule against the government, including on politically sensitive issues like the September 2022 decision to declare Prime Minister Majoro’s state of emergency declaration unconstitutional. High Court judges often fail to provide justification for their decisions.In January 2022, Chief Justice Sakoane instituted an inquiry under the Speedy Court Trials Act and found lead prosecutor, Shaun Abrahams, guilty of delaying a trial. Sakoane’s decision was overruled in a judgement by the Court of Appeal, which found that he had acted unlawfully and could be biased against Abrahams. The court ordered that Sakoane to recuse himself from the case.",2,"The courts generally uphold due process. However, a large backlog of cases, estimated in May 2022 to be more than 4,000, has left individuals subject to trial delays and lengthy pretrial detention, including in high-profile cases like the prosecution of former army commander Tlali Kamoli. Judicial vacancies often go unfilled due to a lack of funds, reducing the judiciary’s capacity to address the backlog and creating further delays. Amendments from 2021 to provisions of the Speedy Court Trials Act 2002 calls for trials of accused persons to begin within two months of first being remanded.",2,"Lesotho faced years of violence related to factional disputes within the army; the SADC appointed a the National Reforms Authority in 2019 to create a reform process that would partially focus on the security sector, though these major reforms have not materialized. The constitution provides legal protections against torture, but allegations of torture have been levied against police forces, the LDF, and prison authorities. In January 2022, prominent human rights lawyer Napo Mafaesa was reportedly arrested and tortured by the police after allegedly concealing a weapon belonging to his client. His own lawyer, who had filed an urgent application for his release, had to go into hiding after allegedly receiving death threats from the police. Many cases of police brutality, extrajudicial killings, and torture are unresolved.",2,"Rights are restricted for some groups. Same-sex sexual activity is legal, though same-sex marriage remains prohibited. LGBT+ individuals face societal discrimination and challenges accessing services, like health care. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not prohibited by law.Customary laws and other social norms discriminate against women. For example, women are considered minors under the guardianship of their fathers before marriage and their husbands after marriage.Schools often lack facilities for students with disabilities. In March 2021, Parliament passed the Persons with Disability Equity Act, bringing the country’s laws into accord with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which it is a signatory. Under the new law, the government introduced a disability grant program for those living with disabilities in Lesotho and continued to make plans to establish a Disability Advisory Council that would assist with funds disbursement.",2
liberia,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but it is impeded by corruption, backlogs, and funding shortfalls, particularly in rural areas. The Supreme Court claimed in September 2021 that judges at all levels of the judiciary have experienced a rise in verbal and physical harassment.In May 2021, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court, Francis Korkpor, acknowledged the influence of corrupt actors on the judiciary’s independence. Critics have also raised concerns that the outcomes of some trials seem predetermined and perceive the judiciary as being controlled by the executive. The new chief justice, Sie-A-Nyene Yuoh, was nominated by President Weah in August 2022 and confirmed by the Senate later that month.",1,"The right to due process is guaranteed by the constitution but poorly upheld. Many people accused of crimes spend more time in pretrial detention than the length they would serve for a guilty sentence. As of August 2022, 77 percent of inmates at Monrovia’s central prison—Liberia’s largest detention center—are pretrial detainees. Citizens with financial means at times bribe judges to rule in their favor. Reports of arbitrary arrest by law enforcement agents continue.",1,"The security environment in Liberia has improved dramatically since warfare ended in 2003. However, citizens still view the police force as corrupt, and security agencies lack the financial means to meaningfully protect citizens from violence. Prison conditions are very poor, and detainees and prisoners continue to report abuse and threats by law enforcement agents and prison guards.",2,"Some minority ethnic groups continue to be stigmatized as outsiders, and the Muslim population experiences some discrimination. LGBT+ people face social stigma and the threat of violence. President Weah has not supported same-sex marriage.",2
libya,"The role of the judiciary remains unclear without a permanent constitution, and judges, lawyers, and prosecutors face frequent threats and attacks from armed groups. Courts are unable to function in much of the country, and even in areas where they do operate, their integrity and impartiality have been compromised. Some residents have resorted to informal dispute-resolution mechanisms, and the LAAF oversees a military court system in eastern Libya, but these venues lack due process and judicial autonomy.The HoR leadership routinely interferes with the judiciary’s composition. In late 2021, the HoR enacted a law that empowered it to change the leadership of the Supreme Judicial Council. The legislative body then appointed a slate of new Supreme Court judges in August 2022, named a new Supreme Court chief in September, and issued legislation in December to establish a Constitutional Court that would sit in Benghazi. These and other such moves were contested by the HCS, and their legal recognition by existing judicial institutions in Tripoli remained unclear at year’s end.",0,"Since the 2011 revolution, the right of citizens to a fair trial and due process has been challenged by the continued interference of armed groups and an inability to access lawyers and court documents. Militias and semiofficial security forces regularly engage in arbitrary arrests, detentions, and intimidation with impunity. Thousands of individuals remain in custody without any formal trial or sentencing. The LAAF’s military courts routinely flout basic standards of due process and are used to suppress dissent.Some Libyans have sought justice by turning to courts outside the country. In July 2022, a US federal court ruled in a civil suit that Haftar—a dual American-Libyan citizen—was financially liable for torture and abuses against civilians that amounted to war crimes.",0,"Libya’s warring militias and their foreign partners operate with little regard for the physical security of civilians. Various armed groups have carried out indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas, torture of detainees, summary executions, rape, and the destruction of property. Militias also engage in criminal activity, including extortion and other forms of predation on the civilian population.While there was no sustained combat during 2022, clashes broke out in August between militias in downtown Tripoli after GNS representatives from the east attempted to establish a presence in the capital, challenging the authority of the GNU. At least 32 people were killed, and another 159 were reportedly injured.",0,"Libyans from certain tribes, ethnic groups, and Indigenous communities—often those perceived as pro-Qadhafi or non-Libyan, including natives of the town of Tawergha—have faced discrimination, violence, and displacement. The Tebu and Tuareg populations in the south also face discrimination.Foreign migrant workers, asylum seekers, and refugees have been subject to severe mistreatment, including detention in squalid facilities by state authorities and other armed groups. A 2021 fact-finding mission appointed by the UN Human Rights Council reported that Libyan authorities had engaged in systematic and widespread human rights violations against the country’s migrant population, resulting in the murder, torture, imprisonment, rape, and persecution of migrants. There were nearly 700,000 foreign migrants in the country as of December 2022, according to the International Organization for Migration.Women are not treated equally under the law and face practical restrictions on their ability to participate in the workforce. Widows and displaced women in particular are vulnerable to economic deprivation and other abuses. Under Libya’s penal code, sexual activity between members of the same sex is punishable by up to five years in prison. LGBT+ people face severe discrimination and harassment, and have been targeted for violence by militant groups.",0
liechtenstein,"The judiciary is generally independent and impartial, but the constitution gives the prince powerful influence over the appointment of judges, meaning the process lacks a key element of democratic accountability. The selection board for judicial candidates is chaired by the prince or his deputy, whose assent is required for candidate recommendations; the rest of the board consists of the prince’s appointees and representatives of the government and parliamentary parties. The recommended candidates are submitted for approval by the parliament and appointment by the prince. A 2020 GRECO report called for the selection board to include judges chosen by their peers, and for the appointment procedure to feature specific integrity criteria that candidates must meet. While the Judicial Appointment Act was amended in March 2022 to stipulate that the president of a court should be consulted when a vacancy on the court is being filled, GRECO noted this provision does not counteract the problematic composition of the judicial selection board.",3,"The constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the rights of defendants are usually respected. Most trials are public, and defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty. Some concerns remain about particular aspects of police custody procedures, including the fact that police can deny the presence of a lawyer during initial questioning.",4,"People in Liechtenstein are largely free from the illegitimate use of physical force. Violent crime is extremely rare. While the country’s small prison facility can hold up to 16 men and 4 women in short-term detention, those serving longer sentences are incarcerated in neighboring Austria.",4,"The legal framework prohibits discrimination on various grounds, though some shortcomings remain. In 2018, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) reiterated the need for Liechtenstein to ratify Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights, which makes a general prohibition against discrimination.Despite the presence of antidiscrimination laws, women, particularly Muslim women, and LGBT+ people experience employment discrimination. Women continue to earn significantly less on average than their male counterparts. LGBT+ individuals face social stigma, and according to a leading human rights group, they often do not disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity out of fear of bias.",3
lithuania,"Although public confidence in the courts has been steadily improving in recent years, judicial corruption remains a concern. There are significant delays in appointments to high judicial positions. Notably, as of the end of 2022, the Supreme Court had been headed by an acting president since September 2019. There are also concerns regarding transparency in the selection of judges and low pay for some work in the court system.",3,"Defendants generally enjoy the presumption of innocence and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, but detained suspects are not always granted timely access to an attorney. The law states that pretrial detention should only be employed in exceptional circumstances, and its use has declined in recent years. However, due to low pay levels, many qualified lawyers do not wish to participate in the state-guaranteed legal aid system. Moreover, recent legislative changes have further restricted legal access for socially vulnerable groups by allowing the authorities to exact litigation costs from people who were provided with legal aid and subsequently convicted. The prosecutor general’s office is largely independent of political control and influence. However, underfinancing remains an issue.",3,"The population is largely free from major threats to physical security, and the homicide rate has declined in recent years, though it remains one of the highest in the EU.Although the government has taken measures to improve the situation, conditions at some prisons are substandard, violence among prisoners remains a problem, and physical abuse of prisoners by correctional officers persists. ",3,"The constitution guarantees equality before the law and forbids discrimination based on gender, race, language, and other categories. The laws provide similar protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, though gender identity is not addressed. In practice, women generally earn less than men per hour worked, and both LGBT+ people and members of the Romany minority experience societal discrimination. Ethnic Poles and members of other national minority groups have objected to limits on the use of their languages; public signs must be written only in Lithuanian, even in areas predominantly inhabited by people who speak different languages.The Lithuanian government continued to apply pushbacks against migrants crossing the Belarus border; approximately 11,200 people were stopped from entering the country this way in 2022. Foreign registration centers for accepted migrants have been criticized by international human rights watchers for poor physical conditions and ill-treatment. Despite a June 2022 European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling that the pushback policy violated EU law, the Lithuanian government refused to abandon the policy, instead working to enshrine it into law. The Lithuanian capacity to absorb migration was affected in 2022 by the influx of some 72,000 refugees from Ukraine, who were welcomed much more favorably than the mostly African and Middle Eastern refugees affected by the pushbacks and substandard living conditions.",2
luxembourg,Judicial independence is generally upheld. Judges are appointed by the grand duke and cannot be removed arbitrarily.Parliament finished discussions in December 2022 regarding a constitutional amendment that strengthens the independence of the judiciary by establishing a Council of Justice. The council will be competent to nominate candidates for all judicial posts prior to their formal appointment by the executive and grand duke. The reform will take effect in 2023.,4,"Due process is largely upheld in civil and criminal matters. Defendants have the right to a fair and public trial, and this right is generally respected. Police typically observe safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention.",4,"There are no major threats to civilians’ physical security. Prison conditions and protections against the illegitimate use of force are adequate, and violent crime is rare.",4,"Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, disability, age, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation is prohibited by law. The rights of LGBT+ people are generally respected.Women have benefited from reductions in the gender pay gap and an increase in their labor participation rate in recent years, though women still hold significantly fewer senior positions than men.The Luxembourg government has instituted an onerous language requirement for those seeking public sector jobs and employment. Individuals in the public sector must speak German, French, and Luxembourgish fluently. However, very few official documents are in Luxembourgish, and exceptions to this requirement are made for high-level positions due to a lack of qualified candidates. The requirement funnels citizens into public sector positions, which are lucrative and secure, pushing immigrant workers into the unstable private sector in which there are other barriers to entry. Moreover, discrimination in the education system limits somewhat the economic potential of nonnationals.",3
madagascar,"The executive influences judicial decisions through the reassignment of judges. Trial outcomes are frequently predetermined, and the Malagasy people generally regard the judiciary as corrupt. Local tribunals are seen as overburdened and corrupt.In recent years, key HCC rulings have reflected its growing independence from the executive. However, the HCC has at times approved Rajoelina’s actions and disregarded legitimate allegations of corruption, despite legitimate protests from the opposition.",2,"Due process rights are poorly upheld. A lack of training, resources, and personnel hampers the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. Many people held in pretrial detention do not have access to lawyers, and the successful assertion of due process rights is often tied to the ability of family and friends to intercede on behalf of the accused.The government has increased funding for the judiciary, launched capacity-building efforts, and pardoned individuals detained over minor offenses as part of a new policy supported by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).",1,"The police and military are unable to assert authority over the entire country, and areas in southern Madagascar are subjected to raids and violence by bandits and criminal groups. Security forces operate with little oversight or accountability for extrajudicial killings, particularly against cattle thieves—known as dahalo. Nevertheless, since 2020, new military bases were built in these areas that were traditionally called “red zones,” under the control of the dahalo. In July 2022, a gang of dahalo rounded up the inhabitants of a village in Ankazobe, about 47 miles north of Antananarivo, and burned them alive inside their homes, killing at least 32. Some members of the gang were arrested, but others were still at large.Detainees and prisoners suffer from harsh and sometimes life-threatening conditions due to overcrowding in detention facilities, as well as substandard hygiene and health care. People convicted of serious crimes can be sentenced to hard labor.In August 2022, police fired live ammunition at a mob of people carrying weapons in the small town of Ikongo (about 200 miles south of the capital city Antananarivo) killing at least 19 people. The mob had demanded police hand over four people who had been arrested for kidnapping.",2,"Legal provisions prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, disability, and social status, but these are upheld inconsistently. Conservative cultural and social norms can prevent women from having the same opportunities as men. Some ethnic groups face discrimination outside of their home regions.There are no legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity; LGBT+ people face social stigma, particularly in rural areas, and experience employment discrimination and occasional acts of violence. The age of consent for same-sex relations is 21, but 14 for heterosexual relations.",2
malawi,"Judicial independence is generally respected, particularly in the higher courts. However, the appointment process for judges lacks transparency, and the judiciary is underfunded, which can also undercut judicial autonomy. Accusations of corruption have been made against the judiciary, especially against lower courts.The High Court of Malawi’s bench was not full during 2022; 7 judges were appointed in February, but the entire court was short of its envisioned contingent of 78. In June, Chakwera appointed four High Court judges to the Supreme Court of Appeal to address a backlog at that court.The Courts Act Amendment Bill was passed in August 2022. It increased the retirement age of judges to 70 and established a High Court division to handle financial crimes.",3,"Defendants are entitled to legal representation, but in practice they are frequently forced to represent themselves in court due to a very low lawyer-to-population ratio. Although the law requires that suspects be released or charged with a crime within 48 hours of arrest, these rights are often ignored. Case backlogs contribute to lengthy pretrial detention.The Legal Aid Bureau was formed under the 2011 Legal Aid Act (LAA) to support indigent and vulnerable clients. It has continued to advocate for changes to the LAA to allow paralegals to serve as legal counsel for the indigent. However, the Malawi Law Society has voiced opposition to the proposal.",2,"Police are poorly trained, ill-equipped, and often ineffective. Police brutality and corruption is common. Prison conditions are dire and characterized by overcrowding; the country’s prison population stood at 233.8 percent of capacity as of October 2022. A Malawi Human Rights Commission report released that month indicated that the country’s main prisons had run out of certain foods due to funding and rising prices; prisoners went without food for days or relied on outside assistance.",2,"The constitution explicitly guarantees the rights of all humans. Homophobia remains commonplace, however; in an Afrobarometer survey released in August 2022, a large majority of respondents expressed discomfort with the idea of LGBT+ neighbors. Same-sex relations remain a crime punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment.Despite constitutional equal protection guarantees, women experience discrimination in education, politics, employment, business, and other aspects of life. In a June 2022 report, the World Bank said that Malawi had made improvements closing the gender gap, but improvements to education, maternal health, and policy implementation were still needed.Help for children with disabilities is rarely available.",2
malaysia,"Judicial independence has historically been compromised by extensive executive influence, with courts frequently issuing arbitrary or politically motivated verdicts in high-profile cases. However, a series of judicial appointments in 2018 and 2019 improved confidence in the independence of the higher courts and prospects for reform. In 2019, Datuk Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat became the first woman to serve as chief justice of the Federal Court, and she subsequently initiated anticorruption and efficiency-enhancing reforms.The Federal Court’s August 2022 decision to uphold former prime minister Najib’s prison sentence was an important sign of judicial independence, particularly at a time when the defendant’s party was in power. In December, the High Court, ruling in a civil lawsuit, ordered the Malaysian government, two former police officers, and a close adviser to Najib to pay financial compensation to the family of a Mongolian model whom the officers murdered in 2006; allegations that Najib or his adviser had ordered the killing—though never proven in criminal court—had long plagued his political career.The Federal Court has also issued rulings against the government that supported individuals’ legal and constitutional rights in recent years. In December 2022, the court agreed to hear an appeal by Malaysian mothers who were challenging the government’s position that their children born overseas to foreign fathers were not entitled to automatic Malaysian citizenship.",3,"Several existing laws undermine due process guarantees. The 2012 Security Offences (Special Measures) Act allows police to detain anyone for up to 28 days without judicial review for broadly defined “security offenses,” and suspects may be held for 48 hours before being granted access to a lawyer. It was renewed for another five years in 2017. Also that year, lawmakers amended the Prevention of Crime Act—a law ostensibly aimed at combating organized crime—to revoke detainees’ right to address the government-appointed Prevention of Crime Board, which is empowered to order the detention of individuals listed by the Home Ministry for renewable two-year terms without trial or legal representation. The 2015 Prevention of Terrorism Act, together with that year’s National Security Council (NSC) Act, gives the NSC—led by the prime minister—wide powers of arrest, search, and seizure without a warrant in areas deemed to be security risks and in the context of countering terrorism.Malaysia’s secular legal system is based on English common law. However, Muslims are subject to Sharia (Islamic law), the interpretation of which varies by state, and the constitution’s Article 121 stipulates that all matters related to Islam should be heard in Sharia courts. This results in different treatment of Muslims and non-Muslims in “moral” and family law cases.",2,"A number of criminal offenses can be punished with caning, including immigration violations. Torture and abuse in police custody remain problems, and prisons are often overcrowded and unsafe. In recent years, prisoners and detainees have died in unclear circumstances while in custody. There were 24 deaths in police custody in 2022, down from 46 in 2021.The death penalty can be applied for numerous offenses; most of the roughly 1,300 people facing execution were convicted under the country’s harsh laws on drug trafficking. In June 2022, the government announced that it would introduce legislation to abolish mandatory death sentences, meaning judges would have the discretion to impose alternative penalties for the relevant offenses. The legislation was pending in Parliament at year’s end.",2,"Although the constitution provides for equal treatment of all citizens, it grants a “special position” to ethnic Malays and other groups that are considered native to Malaysia, known collectively as bumiputera. The government maintains programs intended to boost the economic status of bumiputera, who receive preferential treatment over ethnic minorities such as the Chinese and Indians in areas including property ownership, higher education, civil service jobs, business affairs, and government contracts.Women are placed at a disadvantage by a number of laws, particularly Sharia-related provisions. They are legally barred from certain occupations and work schedules, and they suffer from de facto employment discrimination.LGBT+ Malaysians face widespread discrimination and harassment. Same-sex sexual relations are punishable by up to 20 years in prison as well as whipping under the penal code. Some states apply their own penalties to Muslims under Sharia statutes. Transgender people can also be punished under state-level Sharia laws. In August 2022, Human Rights Watch and Justice for Sisters published a report on government-funded religious “retreats” known as mukhayyam that aim to “rehabilitate” or change LGBT+ people; it cited JAKIM statistics showing that more than 1,700 people had attended the retreats over several years.Migrant workers and refugees do not enjoy effective legal protections, and individuals in these communities experienced discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ethnic Rohingya asylum seekers and refugees from Myanmar are regularly mistreated.",1
maldives,"The Supreme Court has intervened in political affairs at times, typically acting according to political interests. While significant strides have been made under the new government to reinforce basic principles of autonomy, quality, and accountability, much remains to be done to ensure efficient administration of justice.In 2022, three High Court judges were removed by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) after an investigation revealed they had illegally accepted real estate gifts during the Yameen administration. The JSC reported that a total of 393 complaints were submitted against judges during the year; 46 cases were closed, and of those, misbehavior was found in 24.Recent amendments to the Judicial Service Commission Act have the potential to bring positive changes to the Maldives, specifically regarding the impeachment of judges. However, the composition of the JSC must remain neutral if the provisions are to be upheld. In 2022, the JSC is still widely considered to be compromised because its members hold political affiliations.In 2019, the government appointed the first two women to the Supreme Court, despite Islamist objections. In September 2020, a woman was appointed to the Criminal Court bench for the first time in the country’s history, and there was a record number of female judges in the Maldivian judiciary at the end of 2022.",2,"Police have regularly engaged in arbitrary arrests, often to disrupt opposition activities, protests, or the work of journalists. Due process rights are not well enforced in practice, and under Yameen, opposition figures were subjected to deeply flawed trials on politically motivated charges. The Maldives Police Services Act of 2020 was intended to improve internal police governance, but it has resulted in few changes in practice thus far. Pretrial detention is common, accounting for nearly 30 percent of those currently held in detention facilities in the country. Many are held in pretrial detention for inordinately long periods due to delays in investigation and trial processes. The Maldives also imposes imprisonment for nonpayment of debt through contempt-of-court rulings.In December 2020, President Solih signed into law a bill establishing a transitional justice mechanism to investigate and redress human rights abuses from 1953–2018. The Ombudsman’s Office for Transitional Justice opened in January 2021 and has since reported that it has probed 452 cases that were submitted to the office in accordance with the Transitional Justice Act.The Transitional Justice Office held both closed and public hearings on the Thinadhoo forced eviction case, which was brought forward by the Thinadhoo Council and included testimonials from victims and their families. The case requested a formal apology from the state, the upholding of violated rights, and the seizure of 50 percent of the assets of all perpetrators as compensation. The 1962 forced eviction of the island is considered one of the greatest atrocities committed by a Maldivian government.",1,"The constitution and the Anti-Torture Act ban torture, but police brutality and the abuse of detainees and prison inmates remain problems, and impunity remains the norm. Flogging and other forms of corporal punishment are authorized for some crimes, and flogging sentences have been issued in practice for offenses such as extramarital sex. Prisons are overcrowded, inmates reportedly lack proper access to medical care, and human rights groups have reported numerous unexplained deaths in custody.",2,"Gender-based discrimination in employment is prohibited by law, but women continue to face discrimination in practice. Girls and women from underprivileged backgrounds are disproportionately affected by Sharia (Islamic law) penalties for crimes like fornication and adultery.Migrant workers—who account for approximately a third of the population—encounter disparate treatment by state authorities and have difficulty accessing justice. In 2020, thousands of migrant workers with unclear immigration status were arbitrarily deported during the COVID-19 pandemic.Same-sex sexual acts and marriage are prohibited by law and can draw prison sentences, corporal punishment, and even threats of citizenship revocation. As a result, LGBT+ people rarely report societal discrimination or abuse. In 2022, a blackmail ring targeting gay men identified four individuals as gay. They were arrested and later charged under laws that criminalize same-sex relations.",2
mali,"The judiciary is beholden to the executive, despite constitutional guarantees of judicial independence. Judges are appointed by the president, while the minister of justice supervises both law enforcement and judicial functions.In July 2020, President Keïta announced the removal of Constitutional Court judges as part of an effort to resolve the country’s postelection political impasse. That August, nine judges were appointed to the court; three were named by Keïta, three by National Assembly president Moussa Timbine, and three by a judicial council. The appointments were met with criticism due to the involvement of a Keïta ally in the judges’ installation.Militant attacks against judicial personnel have prompted some judges to vacate their posts.",2,"Due process rights are inconsistently upheld. Detainees are not always charged within the 48-hour period set by law, and arbitrary arrests are common. Detainees also face extended pretrial detention periods. High costs and lengthy procedures inhibit access to the justice system. After a deadly 2015 terrorist attack in Bamako, a national state of emergency remained in force for several years. The emergency designation gave security services greater authority to search homes without a warrant, detain suspects, and restrict protests. The military government suspended that state of emergency after taking power in August 2020, though a COVID-19-related state of emergency was declared in late December 2020. Due process rights were not consistently upheld for high-ranking officials detained by the military in the August 2020 coup d’état. The Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission created in 2014 is responsible for investigating human rights violations committed since 1960, but its activities are restricted by the rise of terrorist activities and intercommunal tensions within Mali’s borders. Due process is not upheld in areas under militant control.",1,"The security situation in Mali continued to deteriorate in 2022, leading to a decline in the protection of human rights in the country; MINUSMA documented a nearly 50 percent increase in human rights violations and abuses during the first half of the year compared with the previous six months. Islamist militant groups that were not party to a 2015 peace agreement signed in Algiers continue to carry out acts of violence against civilians in the northern and central regions. In August 2022, the UN Independent Expert on Mali noted that the country was experiencing a resurgence of extremist violence; that December, multiple northern armed groups pulled out of the Algiers peace agreement. Since 2012, militant groups affiliated with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) have regularly enforced brutal punishments—including stoning and amputation—on civilians they accuse of crimes. Ongoing instability has contributed to the spread of organized crime and accompanying violence and kidnappings. In April 2021, French journalist Olivier Dubois was abducted by the Support Group for Islam and Muslims (GSIM), a militant group with reported links to Al-Qaeda. Dubois was still being held hostage at year-end 2022. Hundreds of civilians were killed in conflict throughout 2022. The Katibat Macina armed group killed some 132 civilians in a two-day period in June during multiple attacks in Bankass district. Malian military personnel have been known to engage in human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, and arbitrary arrests. In March 2022, Malian military forces and members of the Wagner Group allegedly executed 300 civilian men over a five-day period in Moura, a town in central Mali. Foreign forces have played an important role in supporting the government’s fight against violent extremist organizations. After nine years of providing military support in Mali, the French government announced plans to withdraw its troops in February 2022; the last French soldiers left in August. Several other countries announced plans to withdraw their forces from MINUSMA during 2022. The UK cited the presence of the Wagner Group as part of its reason for leaving. In July, Malian authorities arrested 49 Côte d’Ivoire soldiers upon their arrival in Mali, claiming that they were mercenaries who had entered the country without permission. Ivorian officials condemned the arrests, saying that the soldiers had been sent to take part in MINUSMA. In December, a Malian court sentenced 46 of the soldiers to 20 years in prison for undermining Malian security; the other 3 soldiers, who had been released in September, were issued death sentences in absentia.Prisons are characterized by overcrowding, insufficient medical care, and a lack of proper food and sanitation.",0,"Members of a northern caste known as Black Tamasheqs face societal discrimination, including slavery-like treatment and hereditary servitude. Authorities sometimes deny them official documents or discriminate against them in housing, schooling, and police protection.Arabs and Tuaregs also face discrimination. In 2020, Arab and Tuareg merchants in Timbuktu reported that they commonly faced blame for criminal and jihadist activity in the region.Same-sex sexual acts are legal, but LGBT+ people face discrimination, including cases of violence by family members that is meant as a corrective punishment.Although the constitution nominally guarantees equal rights and prohibits discrimination based on sex, men and women do not have the same legal status, and women are required by law to obey their husbands. Sexual harassment is not prohibited by law and is a common practice in schools and the workplace.Conditions in northern Mali have left many refugees unable or unwilling to return, as continuing insecurity in the region complicates resettlement. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) counted almost 198,000 Malian refugees living in asylum countries and more than 440,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) as of the end of 2022.",1

In 2021, the European Union (EU) Agency for Asylum disclosed that it had received reports of such abuse, and the director of Malta’s prisons was dismissed amid evidence of ill-treatment and suicides among inmates. An official inquiry into prison conditions was conducted, and the government pledged to adopt its recommended reforms. However, the former prisons director was subsequently appointed as a government envoy in Libya to oversee cooperation on combating illegal migration. In October 2022, his successor in the prisons post was charged with threatening an ambulance driver with a gun.",3,"Discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion is prohibited by law, and this ban is generally enforced.

However, a pay gap persists between men and women, and a survey of public opinion published in February 2022 indicated a high level of racial prejudice in society.While Malta has committed to comply with international and EU rules on refugees and asylum seekers, NGOs working with such individuals sometimes report police harassment and hostility from far-right groups. Many asylum seekers are held in detention centers under overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Maltese authorities have also been criticized for resisting the acceptance of migrants rescued at sea, avoiding their own obligation to conduct rescues, and encouraging pushbacks of migrant vessels to North Africa.",3

From the 1940s through the 1950s, the US military displaced Marshallese living on various atolls, detonated 67 nuclear bombs, destroyed entire islands, and dumped 130 tons of irradiated soil from Nevada into Runit Dome on the atoll Enewetak. Further, the US government withheld key information about the contents of Runit Dome and falsely claimed it would be safe for the Marshallese to return before the 1986 CFA was signed. An international tribunal created by the RMI and United States in 1988 acknowledged $2.3 billion in claims to be paid by the US government; only $4 million had been paid out by 2010.In 2019, then president Heine called on the US government to pay to repair Runit Dome, which was found to be leaking, further endangering the nearby population. In 2020, the United States declared that Runit Dome was safe, despite RMI–provided evidence to the contrary. The RMI’s Nuclear Commission claimed that the US report contained no new analysis and ignored evidence and information from local communities. In 2021, members of a US House of Representatives subcommittee criticized the Biden administration, saying that its stance on Runit Dome was affecting CFA renewal negotiations. In September 2022, RMI negotiators called off scheduled talks on revising the CFA, saying that the US government was unwilling to meaningfully address the country’s nuclear legacy.",4,"Women generally enjoy equal treatment under the law, but there is no explicit ban on discrimination in employment, and women face disadvantages in the workplace in practice.

mexico,"The SCJN has been regarded in recent years as generally independent, but a series of appointments of justices viewed as close to the government has raised concerns about diminished autonomy under López Obrador. Such concerns persisted in 2022; in April, four US congresspeople expressed concern that the Mexican judiciary has become increasingly politicized during the López Obrador administration. The congresspeople alleged that the Attorney General’s Office (FGR), an autonomous entity, has aligned with the president in practice, an allegation that López Obrador denied. In December 2022, Roberto Elías, a judge in Zacatecas, was shot and killed; four members of a drug cartel were charged with his murder later the same week. Authorities have alleged that Judge Elías’s assassination, which remained under investigation at year’s end, was ordered because of rulings he made in his official judicial capacity.",2,"Mexico’s justice system is plagued by delays, unpredictability, and corruption, which often lead to impunity for perpetrators of crimes. Implementation of an adversarial system was technically completed in 2016 and generated some improvements, but judicial system capacity remains inadequate. A lack of political commitment to prosecutorial autonomy and disinterest in deep reform has limited the efficacy of a 2018 overhaul of the prosecutorial services. Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero has been subjected to increasing criticism in recent years as frustration has mounted with the contrast between the agency’s lethargy in matters including corruption and disappearance cases and its punitive zeal in pursuit of organized crime charges against scientists and other matters in which Gertz took personal interest. Widespread bribery, limited capacity, and weak coordination undermine the integrity of the lower courts and law enforcement agencies. According to a 2021 government report, the vast majority of crimes committed in 2020 went unreported, largely because underpaid police were viewed as either inept or in league with criminals. Widely publicized raids often result in the release of accused criminals due to grave procedural deficiencies. Amid faltering efforts to improve investigative and prosecutorial competence and efficacy, the López Obrador administration has sought to harden penalties and limit defendants’ rights, producing a sharp rise in the use of preventive detention and a rapidly increasing rate of prisoners in pretrial detention, most of whom are poor people charged with minor crimes.",1,"Mexicans are subject to the threat of violence at the hands of multiple actors, including individual criminals, criminal gangs that operate with impunity, and police officers who are often susceptible to bribery. A missing-persons registry—which continues to grow despite increased government efforts in recent years—reflects an epidemic of enforced disappearances. Mexicans in police or military custody are at risk of torture by the authorities, and must also navigate a prison system that respects neither due process nor physical safety.Abuses during arrests and criminal investigations are rife, and detainees report routine physical abuse while being detained and held. The 2017 General Law on Torture established a prohibition on the use of torture and disqualified evidence obtained through its use. Though it has contributed to mild progress in excluding torture-based confessions from prosecutions, impunity remains almost universal. Human rights advocates consistently express concern about a lack of accountability for abuses committed by members of the military, including torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. Only a handful of soldiers have been convicted in civilian courts for abuses against civilians, despite myriad reports implicating state security forces in grave human rights abuses. Forced disappearances and killings remain a crisis. The 2017 General Law on Disappearances removed the statute of limitations on missing-persons crimes, but progress remains very limited. As of September 2022, missing-persons cases in the national registry numbered over 105,000, and at least 52,000 bodies remained unidentified. A 2021 report by the Washington Office on Latin America covering 26 states found only 25 convictions on disappearance charges between 2018 and 2020; federal prosecutors made even fewer advances.The kidnapping and presumed deaths of 43 students in Guerrero in 2014 remains a watershed case. President López Obrador created a presidential commission to investigate the case after taking office, and in 2019 a new special prosecutor was assigned to manage it. In August 2022, the government published the preliminary findings of the commission, which alleged that the students’ disappearance was a “crime of the state.” Dozens of arrest warrants were issued, and former attorney general Jesús Murillo Karam was arrested on charges of forced disappearance, torture, and obstruction of justice. However, in September, the special prosecutor unexpectedly resigned, and days later, an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) group of experts released a report alleging that members of López Obrador’s administration had been obstructing the investigation, particularly by intervening to protect members of the military from prosecution. Critics have expressed concern that López Obrador’s administration rushed the commission for political reasons. Significant portions of the commission’s evidence could not be verified, causing the case against Murillo to be suspended and over a dozen arrest warrants for military suspects to be revoked by October. Investigations into the disappearance remained ongoing at year’s end. As in previous years, the government’s primary response to insecurity hotspots was the deployment of militarized forces. In 2019, a law pushed by President López Obrador established a nominally civilian-led gendarmerie that drew from the Army, Navy, and federal police. This National Guard has been sharply criticized by rights advocates for reinforcing the militarization of public security. Homicides have plateaued in recent years, but remained near historic highs in 2022. Violence linked to organized crime was particularly acute in Zacatecas, Baja California, and Colima. While large organizations like the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel continue to drive insecurity in some areas, the splintering of other criminal groups, along with the diversification of their revenue sources, has made efforts to combat the violence even more daunting. Mexican prisons remain highly unsafe, with inmates commonly engaging in criminal activity while incarcerated.",1,"Mexican law bans discrimination based on ethnic origin, gender, age, religion, and sexual orientation. Nevertheless, lighter-skinned Mexicans enjoy substantial social advantage compared to Indigenous people and other distinct groups. The large Indigenous population experiences social and economic discrimination, and approximately 77 percent of Indigenous people live in poverty. Southern states with high concentrations of Indigenous residents suffer from deficient services. Because Indigenous groups are in particular danger from criminal violence, communities in Guerrero and Michoacán have formed self-defense groups, some of which were subsequently legalized. In 2021, a sharp rise in organized crime threats and violence targeting Indigenous communities prompted a wave of self-defense group formation in Chiapas. Afro-Mexicans face discrimination; the 2020 census included an option for Afro-Mexican self-identification for the first time.LGBT+ people have strong legal protections, but they are unevenly enforced. Transgender women in particular face discrimination and violence.Migrants from Central America and other regions, many of whom move through Mexico to reach the United States, have long faced persecution and criminal predation. The López Obrador administration initially sought to protect migrants, but reversed course in 2019 under US threats of punitive economic measures. In response, the National Guard was ordered to block or arrest migrants moving northward, a policy that led to both record detentions and numerous complaints of serious rights abuses in 2021. In January 2021, the bodies of 19 murder victims, including multiple migrants, were found in Tamaulipas, leading to murder charges against 12 Tamaulipas police officers.The combination of increasing migration and a series of US policies, including the 2019 Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) and the rapid deportations implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in tens of thousands of people stranded in border cities like Ciudad Juárez and Nuevo Laredo and facing extreme risk of kidnapping and extortion. The government has made some remediation efforts, but conditions along the border have remained highly precarious.",1

Some of these groups also encounter discrimination in education, housing, and public services. Hate speech against minority groups is promoted by some media outlets and public figures.Schools and universities generally do not provide education in the Ukrainian, Gagauz, Bulgarian, or Romany languages. Low-quality public schools in the south, attended by many Gagauzians and Bulgarians, often fail to prepare graduates for admission to Romanian-language universities.Moldova hosted 96,000 Ukrainian refugees as of November 2022. While the country has largely welcomed these refugees, the Roma among them have faced mistreatment and discrimination. In April, the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) reported that Romany refugees were placed in segregated housing with poor living conditions. In May, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that Roma were sometimes denied access to publicly run facilities. In August, a group of Romany refugees were tear-gassed by security personnel after an altercation at a canteen.

monaco,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. The prince names five full members and two judicial assistants to the Supreme Court based on nominations by the National Council, government bodies, and the lower courts.

Residents of Cabo Delgado Province continue to suffer from violence and displacement due to an ongoing Islamist insurgency. Fighting continued in 2022; in one case in February, insurgents reportedly attacked at least eight villages in Cabo Delgado. The government continued to accept support from regional partners during the year, including Rwanda and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), who have helped reclaim significant territory. SADC and Rwandan military forces continued to successfully counter the insurgency in 2022, leading to a notable improvement in the security environment in Cabo Delgado during the year. However, security forces deployed to fight the insurgents have also been accused of extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, and other abuses. Several organizations have denounced human rights abuses as a result of the conflict. ",1,"Mozambican police reportedly discriminate against Zimbabwean, Somali, and Chinese immigrants. People with albinism continue to face discrimination, persecution, and violence.Women experience discrimination in education and employment; on average, women are less educated and earn less than men. Sexual harassment in the workplace and at schools remains widespread. Homosexuality was decriminalized in 2015, but LGBT+ people face significant discrimination.The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) has increased in Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces due to the escalating conflict.Many Rwandan refugees, some of whom fled violence perpetrated by the Rwandan military, have reported feeling unsafe due to the Rwandan army’s presence in Cabo Delgado. During 2022, a number of Rwandan refugees reported that they were being coerced into accepting “voluntary” repatriation to Rwanda. Others also expressed concern that a June 2022 extradition agreement between Mozambique and Rwanda will be used by the Rwandan government to forcibly repatriate refugees and dissidents residing in Mozambique.",2
myanmar,"The judiciary is not independent. Before the military coup, the courts generally adjudicated cases in accordance with the government’s interests, particularly in major cases with political implications. Following the coup, the military regime forcibly took complete control of Myanmar’s judicial system, which ruled in their favor in several politically motivated cases in 2022.",0,"Following the 2021 coup, revisions to the criminal code and the imposition of a state of emergency (which has been extended several times) have allowed the regime to disregard existing safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. In March 2021, the army enabled military tribunals to impose death sentences on civilians; by December 2022, closed-door tribunals had sentenced more than 130 people to death, according to the UN Human Rights Office. Four executions were carried out in July 2022.The number of political prisoners rose dramatically in 2021; most were arrested while protesting, although dozens of prominent political leaders and some cultural figures were specifically targeted. According to the AAPP, 16,704 individuals had been arrested (of whom around 13,200 were still detained) and over 1,900 had received prison sentences by the end of 2022.",0,"The military coup resulted in a sharp increase in civilian exposure to violence, armed conflict, and the illegitimate use of force. Indiscriminate shelling and aerial attacks, the destruction of villages, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture, rape, and other abuses by the military continued to escalate during 2022. On October 23 alone, at least 80 people were killed by a series of airstrikes on a village in Kachin State. Long-standing armed conflicts between ethnic rebel groups and the central government continued in 2022 in Shan, Kachin, Kayin, Chin, Kayah, and Rakhine States. Even ethnically Bamar areas, particularly the Sagaing and Magwe Regions and major urban centers including Yangon and Mandalay, experienced high levels of violent conflict between junta forces and antimilitary protesters. Lethal and indiscriminate military attacks on peaceful protesters took place across the country; in response, civilian youth across the country formed armed People’s Defense Forces (PDFs) that carried out guerilla attacks against military targets. After the NUG declared a “people’s war” against the military in September 2021, it engaged in efforts to with the PDFs and ethnic rebel groups.The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) increased throughout the year, with those displaced by earlier rounds of fighting in ethnic areas joined by those fleeing the newly installed military regime. By December 2022, the UN estimated that an additional 1.1 million people had been displaced since February 2021, bringing the total number of IDPs to 1.5 million.Prisons in Myanmar are severely overcrowded, and conditions for inmates are extremely unsanitary, sometimes life-threateningly so. Following the coup, the numbers of detainees rapidly increased; grave abuses that had been prevalent during previous periods of military rule were regularly reported. Authorities have reportedly taken few measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 among prison populations.",0,"Some of the country’s worst human rights abuses, commonly committed by federal military troops, are against ethnic and religious minority populations. The government’s failure to protect victims, conduct investigations, and punish perpetrators is well documented. The post-coup period has been characterized by further deterioration in the country’s human rights situation and a lack of accountability for offenders.

Ethnic minority groups such as the Shan, Mon, Chin, Karen, and Kachin, as well as non-Rohingya Muslims, also face some societal discrimination, while the ethnic Bamar, Buddhist majority retains a privileged position.

In addition to conflict-related violence, women are subject to discrimination in employment, against which there are no explicit legal protections. Several laws create a hostile environment for LGBT+ residents. Same-sex sexual activity is criminalized, and police reportedly harass, extort, and physically and sexually abuse LGBT+ people.",0
namibia,"By law and in practice, the separation of powers is observed, and judges are not frequently subject to undue influence. However, the judiciary lacks adequate resources and is vulnerable to budget cuts. Judges are appointed by the president upon the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, which the president has some influence over. Public access to court documents and proceedings has been restricted in recent years; in 2019, documents implicating the president and justice minister in a fraud case were kept out of public view by a court ruling. Women are underrepresented in the judiciary.",3,"The rule of law and fair-trial rights are constitutionally protected, though equal access to justice is obstructed by factors including economic and geographic barriers, a shortage of public defenders, a lack of resources, and case backlogs. In October 2021, the High Court overturned a 2018 corruption indictment of two men, including National Assembly member Tobie Aupindi, on the grounds that they did not receive a fair trial. In February 2022, High Court judges set aside a 2019 conviction and reprimanded a new magistrate for failing to inform a defendant of his rights and explain court processes to him. In September 2022, the High Court sent a case related to the Fishrot bribery scandal back to the Windhoek Magistrate’s Court for review after finding irregularities in its court proceedings.Some cases were postponed, and services were severely affected in lower courts due to government-imposed public health restrictions intended to curb the spread of COVID-19.",3,"Namibia is free from war and insurgencies. However, police brutality and the abuse of suspects in custody are problems. There is no independent police oversight mechanism as investigations are conducted by an Internal Investigation Directorate. In the Owoses v. Government of the Republic of Namibia case, the High Court awarded $145,000 Namibian dollars in damages (US$8,900) to the plaintiff, condemned the pervasiveness of police assaults and lack of accountability, and referred the case to the prosecutor general for further action.",3,"While the constitution prohibits discrimination, challenges remain. The San people face widespread discrimination and marginalization and lack land access. In October 2021, Amnesty International issued a report condemning the government’s “rampant discrimination” against the San communities in the Omaheke and Otjozondjupa regions. In September 2022, the Deputy Minister of Marginalised People observed in an interview that a dedicated ministry could better serve the needs of San communities and people living with disabilities.Same-sex sexual relations remain criminalized, though the prohibition is not enforced. LGBT+ people, people living with disabilities, and women face widespread discrimination. In January 2022 the High Court ruled against two gay couples seeking legal recognition of their foreign marriages in Namibia, but acknowledged that they had been discriminated against based on sexual orientation. In March, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must reconsider its decision to deny residency rights to the same-sex partner of a Namibian man.In September, the Namibian Correctional Services defended its controversial decision to demand pregnancy tests from recruits for its sports teams.In October 2020, an organization representing members of the Baster and Zambesi groups noted widespread discrimination in a report to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).",2
nauru,"There have been concerns about undue influence on the judiciary from government officials, who have been accused of dismissing judges for unfavorable rulings. Many are concerned that government officials have pressured the judiciary in connection with the Nauru 19 case.The Supreme Court is the highest authority on constitutional issues in Nauru. Appeals had previously been heard in the high court of Australia, but in 2018, the country began severing links with Australia’s justice system, ostensibly to reduce costs and to establish greater independence. However, some skeptics viewed the development as a means of denying members of the Nauru 19 activist group an avenue to appeal their cases: Australian Supreme Court Justice Geoffrey Muecke claimed the government pressured the sentencing magistrate to issue the group maximum sentences and terminated his contract after he granted the court proceedings a permanent stay in 2018. The group’s members were ultimately convicted and sentenced to jail time in 2019.Nauru later signed memoranda with neighboring Pacific countries, including Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, to provide justices for Nauru’s new Court of Appeals.The Nauruan government has been accused of interfering with the judicial process and undermining the rule of law. The 2018 contempt-of-court law outlaws criticism of witnesses, judicial officers, or legal representatives in a pending court matter, as well as undermining judicial officials or the authority of courts. Violations of the law, which contains exemptions for government officials deemed to be acting in good faith or the interests of national security, are punishable by fines of up to AU$20,000 (US$13,800) for individuals and AU$50,000 (US$34,500) for corporations.",2,"Though the constitution provides for due process rights, the resumption of legal proceedings against members of the Nauru 19 as well as changes to the appellate jurisdiction indicate that due process is not always respected in practice.Public servants who testify in favor of the government are distinguished legally from those testifying against it. Analysts said it appeared that those who miss work to testify against the government would be placed on leave without pay, and that the law appeared to represent an attempt to discourage civil servants from testifying in favor of the Nauru 19.The permanent stay of the Nauru 19 case granted by Justice Muecke was overturned in 2019, and the members were sentenced to jail time.",2,Civilian authorities control the small police force. Nauru has no armed forces; Australia provides defense assistance under an informal agreement.The Australian processing center for asylum seekers has received considerable international criticism for poor treatment of asylum seekers housed there. Few arrests have been made in connection with alleged abuses of its residents.,3,"The constitution provides for equal treatment regardless of race, country of origin, ethnicity, politics, or gender, but those rights are not always protected in practice. There are few legal protections against discrimination, which is notably a problem for women in the workplace. Same-sex sexual relations were decriminalized in 2016.Several reports have detailed widespread abuse of refugees and asylum seekers forcibly transferred to Nauru under its agreement with Australia. Crimes committed against asylum seekers outside the processing center, where most refugees are housed, frequently go uninvestigated. The asylum seekers suffer from grossly inadequate housing; denial of health care for life-threatening conditions; and a high rate of self-harm attempts among residents, including children detainees—who wait, at times, for years for their asylum applications to be processed. The last children were evacuated from Nauru and resettled in the United States in 2019. Reports from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that year found that refugees had been exposed to asbestos for prolonged periods. In 2019, the Nauruan government denied the medical evacuation of over 20 individuals, all of whom had been vouched for by Australian doctors.Outbreaks of COVID-19 in June 2022 in Nauru resulted in the deterioration of conditions for asylum seekers detained on the island, with detainees facing confinement without adequate food and supplies. Calls by human rights groups to evacuate the detainees from Nauru were ignored.In 2020, the United States agreed to resettle over 1,100 asylum seekers who were in the Nauru and Papua New Guinea processing centers by early 2021. As of August 2021, 398 asylum seekers had been resettled from Nauru to the United States. As of October 2022, 111 asylum seekers transferred to Nauru from Australia remained in the country. In October 2022, the Australian government hired Management and Training Corporation (MTC), a US-based prison operator with a history of negligence and security failures, to oversee the Nauru processing center.In May 2022, a group of anonymous hackers leaked over 200,000 internal emails from the Nauru Police Force documenting the ill-treatment and abuse of asylum seekers detained on the island. The emails referenced attempts to self-harm among the detainees and appeared to show the president of Nauru directing the police commissioner to ignore media requests for comment about attacks on refugees in Nauru.",2
nepal,"The 2015 constitution provides for an independent judiciary. However, judicial independence is compromised by endemic corruption in many courts. The state sometimes ignores local court verdicts, Supreme Court decisions, and National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recommendations. However, in 2021, the Supreme Court was twice able to serve as an effective check against the executive. In February and July, the court reinstated the parliament after former prime minister Oli attempted to dissolve the body in December 2020 and May 2021, respectively. The court ordered that opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba be appointed prime minister.",3,"Constitutional due process guarantees are poorly upheld in practice. Arbitrary arrests occur but appear to be declining. Heavy case backlogs and a slow appeals process result in long pretrial detentions. The government provides legal counsel to those who cannot afford their own, but only at a defendant’s request. Those unaware of this right often represent themselves.",1,"Rights advocates continue to criticize Nepal for failing to punish abuses and war crimes committed during the 1996–2006 civil war. Neither the TRC nor the CIEDP, key transitional justice bodies, has implemented reforms demanded by the United Nations and the Supreme Court. Although the two institutions have received thousands of reports of human rights violations and enforced disappearances, no alleged perpetrators have been prosecuted. In July 2022 the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs initiated a process to amend the Transitional Justice Bill.",2,"The 2015 constitution includes rights for sexual minorities. The first passport on which the holder was permitted to select a third gender was issued in 2015. However, LGBT+ people still face harassment by authorities and other citizens, particularly in rural areas.The constitution only protects the fundamental human rights of Nepali citizens. This potentially leaves the rights of noncitizens, including migrants and people who cannot prove citizenship, unprotected. Tibetans in Nepal face difficulty achieving formal refugee status due to Chinese pressure on the Nepali government. Women often do not receive the same educational and employment opportunities as men.Muslims enjoy greater freedom to practice their religion under the 2015 constitution but continue to face discrimination.Children living with disabilities are sometimes excluded from the education system or face segregation in the classroom.",1
netherlands,"The judiciary is generally independent in law and in practice.

However, substandard detention conditions continued to be reported on Caribbean islands under the jurisdiction of the Netherlands.",4,"The legal framework includes significant protections against discrimination on various grounds, but some forms of bias and disparity persist in practice. A December 2022 report commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs exposed racist practices and attitudes within the institution. Also that month, the government formally apologized for the Netherlands’ historical participation in slavery and the slave trade and announced a program to address that legacy. Open expression of anti-Muslim and xenophobic views was not uncommon during the year. Muslims and people with a migrant background experienced harassment and intimidation, and far-right soccer fans and social media users promoted antisemitic tropes. Labor-market discrimination based on people’s ethnicity, age, pregnancy, or disabilities continued to be documented, and a number of high-profile cases drew attention to sexual violence and harassment—particularly against women—in the workplace.Dutch asylum policies have long drawn criticism for being unduly harsh. Throughout 2022, dozens to hundreds of asylum seekers had to sleep in the open air outside an application center in the village of Ter Apel due to a combination of case backlogs, housing shortages, and lack of flexibility in creating emergency shelters. A district court in The Hague ruled in October that the government must urgently act to bring the situation of asylum seekers into line with international standards.At the same time, almost 87,000 Ukrainian refugees were registered in the country during 2022. They were not included in the ordinary asylum procedure, instead receiving residency and work permits under a special arrangement.The Caribbean islands that are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands lack well-developed asylum procedures. NGOs have called for more government action to support Venezuelan refugees on Aruba and Curaçao. In March 2022, the government of Curaçao stated that it was not bound by international refugee law.",3

Most judges are appointed by the governor general on the recommendation of the attorney general, who first consults with senior jurists.",4,"Law enforcement practices and court procedures provide for due process protections in civil and criminal matters. Defendants and detainees are presumed innocent until proven guilty and by law must immediately be notified of the charges against them.Pretrial detention durations have increased in recent years, as authorities have tightened bail requirements and relaxed the time limit in which cases must be concluded.New Zealand’s counterterrorism legislation allows for broad restrictions to be imposed on individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity, even if they have not been charged or convicted. Amendments that would further strengthen counterterrorism laws were proposed in October 2022, and included changes allowing for greater judicial discretion in setting restrictions for individuals deemed high risk, among other things. The draft amendments remained under consideration in Parliament through year’s end.",4,"Rates of violent crime are relatively low, and residents have legal recourse to seek redress for violations of their physical security. The 2019 Christchurch terrorist attack was the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s modern history. The shooting, which took place at two mosques and killed 51 people, was preplanned and accompanied by an 87-page document filled with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim hate speech. The perpetrator of the shootings received a life sentence in 2020. A Royal Commission inquiry into the causes of the attack identified serious failures by the country’s intelligence services.In 2021, Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen attacked people in an Auckland supermarket, injuring eight before being shot dead by police. In response to the attack, the government quickly amended counterterrorism laws to criminalize the planning of a terrorist attack, among other provisions. The amendments give police warrantless powers of entry, search, and surveillance if an individual is suspected of planning an attack. Some have expressed concern about the lack of oversight in the new laws and the potential for overreach.Prison conditions generally meet international standards, though some facilities are poorly equipped to house detainees with disabilities or mental health problems.",4,"The 1993 Human Rights Act protects all people in New Zealand from discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, among other categories, and its provisions are generally respected in practice. However, Māori—who account for approximately 16 percent of the population—and Pacific Islanders experience some discrimination in schools, the workplace, and the health system. They are also disproportionately represented in the penal system, accounting for just over half of the prison population as of 2022. Recent campaigns to recruit more officers of Māori, Pacific Islander, and Asian descent aim to improve cultural and ethnic sensitivity within the police force and combat profiling and discrimination.The annual Child Poverty Monitor Technical Report has documented for many years that children of Māori and Pacific Islander descent are more likely to experience poverty. The Ardern government faced criticism for its inefficacy in addressing this issue, which it claimed was a policy priority.Racism and discrimination towards people of Asian descent, as well as first generation immigrants, is a challenge. Approximately 50 percent of people of Asian descent reported experiencing racism or discrimination since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.Women continue to face some disparities in employment, including a gender pay gap and underrepresentation in leadership positions in both the public and private sectors. The government enforces strong legislation protecting the rights of LGBT+ people. However, LGBT+ people report workplace discrimination and poorer physical and mental health compared to the general population.Though the government routinely accepts refugees and asylum seekers, the New Zealand Human Rights Commission has raised concerns that refugees are not always given sufficient information to enable them to access important services such as interpreters, housing, and English-language instruction. Separately, asylum seekers are sometimes detained alongside criminal inmates while their identity is being confirmed.",3
nicaragua,"Nicaragua lacks an independent judiciary. The executive branch strongly influences the nomination of judges, and loyalty to the ruling party determines their appointments; many if not most judges reportedly have ties to the FSLN. In the run-up to the 2021 election, the judiciary played a critical role in ordering the arrest of opposition members and ending the legal status of opposition parties, as dictated by the CSE.The judiciary oversaw sham trials of the government’s opponents in 2022, with defendants being convicted of “undermining judicial integrity” in closed proceedings. By May, 50 critics, including former presidential candidates, received prison sentences. In November, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights declared the government in Managua in contempt for ignoring its rulings on the treatment of political prisoners.",0,"Since the 2018 protests, the United Nations and human rights organizations have documented rampant violations of due process. These include widespread arbitrary and politically motivated arrests and detentions by police and allied progovernment forces, failure to produce search or arrest warrants, no discussion of detainees’ rights, no public registry of detainees or their location, and individuals being held incommunicado during initial detention.As of December 2022, the Mechanism for the Recognition of Political Prisoners registered over 225 political prisoners in custody since 2018. The 2022 trials against high-profile political prisoners have taken place behind closed doors and under accelerated timelines.",0,"The 2018 protest movement and subsequent rallies have been met with violent repression by police and informally allied armed forces. Reports from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 2018 and from the relatives of political prisoners in 2022 have documented severe abuses; detainees face psychological and physical torture, sexual violence, forced confessions, disappearances, significant deterioration of prison conditions, and extrajudicial killings. In February, Jorge Hugo Torres Jiménez, a former Sandinista guerrilla who later supported the opposition, died in prison; he was detained in 2021 and was held in poor conditions before falling ill later that year. Some prisoners were sent into house arrest soon after Torres’s death, with the attorney general’s office citing “humanitarian reasons.”In March 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that more than 150,000 Nicaraguans have fled to Costa Rica since 2018.",1,"The constitution and laws nominally recognize the rights of Indigenous communities, but those rights have not been respected in practice.

Attacks against Indigenous populations and land incursions have been perpetrated with impunity in recent years. In March 2022, Indigenous representatives reported that they lived at “a high risk of ethnocide” due to mistreatment and the loss of land rights, and called on the government to protect them. In August, the OHCHR expressed concern over violence against Indigenous Nicaraguans and residents of African descent.LGBT+ people are subject to threats and discrimination, and many, particularly transgender Nicaraguans, have been forced to seek exile.",1
niger,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary and courts have shown some level of independence, though the judicial system is subject to executive interference. Rulings against opposition leaders and civil society activists have decreased trust in the judiciary.",1,"Arbitrary arrests and imprisonments are frequent. Many people accused of crimes are held in pretrial detention for extended periods of time, sometimes in the same population as convicted individuals. States of emergency declared in several regions allow the army to engage in mass arrests and detain those suspected of links with terrorist organizations.In November 2021, during a protest in the town of Tera against a convoy of French troops, 3 civilians were killed and 17 were injured. The Nigerien government and French army opened an investigation only to conclude in May 2022 that the probe had not yielded clear results about what had happened; they also announced that they would compensate the victims. The investigation report was not made public, and some civil society activists expressed doubts that any investigation had been conducted.",2,"Nigeriens face insecurity due to ongoing militant activity. Several militant groups, including Boko Haram, are active within Nigerien territory and are known to attack civilians and military personnel.The government has imposed states of emergency within the regions of Diffa, Tillabéri, and Tahoua over ongoing insecurity. Jihadist violence around Tillabéri and Diffa persisted in 2022, though it has diminished in intensity in comparison to an especially violent 2021. In February 2022, President Bazoum announced that his government had opened a dialogue channel with jihadist groups operating in the Tillabéri Region. The kidnapping of civilians for ransom persists, particularly in Maradi and Diffa Regions. A reliance on nonstate armed groups to conduct counterterrorism operations has inflamed intercommunal tensions near the Niger-Mali border, leading to instances of violence.",1,"The rights of ethnic minority groups are protected by law, but discrimination persists in some respects in practice. Same-sex sexual activity is not illegal in Niger, but same-sex relationships are highly stigmatized, and there is no protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Although the 2010 constitution prohibits gender discrimination, women suffer widespread discrimination in practice. The application of the law by customary courts often discriminates against women.While two ethnic groups, Hausa and Zarma (or Djerma), have dominated economic leadership positions, Tuareg and Arabs are increasingly represented.Nigerien authorities have made efforts to accommodate Malian and Nigerian refugees as well as internally displaced persons (IDPs). In July 2021, the Bazoum administration committed to repatriating 100,000 IDPs to their home villages by that December. The government also promised to take extra measures to guarantee the security of IDPs and refugees.",2
nigeria,"Judicial independence is constitutionally and legally enshrined. The judiciary has achieved some degree of independence and professionalism, but political interference, corruption, equipment, and training remain key problems. Funding is also a problem for the judiciary. In 2020, President Buhari signed an executive order ostensibly giving state-level judiciaries and legislatures financial autonomy. Nigeria’s 36 state governors sued the federal government that September, alleging that it sought to avoid its financial responsibilities through the order. The Supreme Court dismissed the suit in February 2022, affirming that the government is not responsible for funding state courts.",2,"There have been numerous allegations of extortion and bribe taking within the police force. Federal and state authorities have been criticized for disregarding due process, with prolonged pretrial detention of suspects even after courts ordered their release on bail. Children with suspected Boko Haram ties face military detention according to a 2020 United Nations report. Accountability for the use of force during the 2020 #EndSARS protests has been lacking. In November 2021, a panel of inquiry found that authorities attempted to conceal their actions at the Lekki toll gate. While the panel made 32 recommendations to the Lagos state government that month, the government fully accepted 11 and modified 6.Nigerians in the southeast risked arbitrary arrest during the government’s campaign against the IPOB’s armed wing, which began in January 2021.In late June 2021, IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu was arrested in Kenya and returned to Nigeria, facing charges including treason. That July, Kanu’s lawyer accused the Kenyan government of mistreating him before returning him to Nigeria, which it denied. Later that month, the United Kingdom called on the Nigerian government to explain the circumstances of Kanu’s arrest; Kanu maintains British citizenship. A Nigerian court dropped all charges against Kanu in October 2022, ruling against the government to find that his arrest and extradition had been illegal. Though the court ordered Kanu’s “immediate release,” the government refused to comply. The government appealed the decision, and an appellate court placed a stay on the ruling’s implementation. Kanu remained in prison at year’s end.",1,"The military has been repeatedly criticized by local and international human rights groups for extrajudicial killings, torture, and other abuses, including during counterinsurgency efforts in the northeast and operations against separatist movements in the southeast.A Reuters investigation published in December 2022 reported that, according to dozens of military and civilian eyewitnesses, the Nigerian military has “slaughtered” at least 60 children perceived to be “children of Boko Haram” since 2009. Unconfirmed witness reports claim the number of child deaths is significantly higher. The Nigerian military has denied the allegations. In January 2021, the government launched a campaign targeting the IPOB’s armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), which was formed in late 2020 and targeted police stations and other public buildings. Security personnel used excessive force and extrajudicially executed residents during their campaign. Amnesty International reported that security forces killed at least 115 people between March and June 2021; many victims were not affiliated with the ESN.Police have also been accused of using excessive force. Amnesty International reported that the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was responsible for at least 82 cases of torture, ill-treatment, or extrajudicial killings between 2017 and May 2020. Although SARS was dissolved in 2020, allegations of police abuse persist.Boko Haram and ISWAP remained active during 2022. Between January and March, the groups are reported to have carried out 81 attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In July, armed men attacked a prison near Abuja, allowing approximately 900 inmates to escape; ISWAP later claimed responsibility for the attack.A rolling conflict between farmers and the Fulani, a seminomadic Muslim ethnic group, continued to destabilize northern Nigeria in 2022. The Fulani have abandoned degraded grasslands in the north, coming into increased conflict with farmers as they travel south to find new grazing lands.Kidnapping and other forms of criminality are acute concerns. According to the Council on Foreign Relations’s (CFR’s) Nigeria Security Tracker (NST), more than 8,000 people were killed in 2022, and thousands of others were kidnapped. In one major incident in March, armed men attacked a train headed from Abuja to Kaduna, killing at least 8 people and kidnapping more than 60 others; the final kidnapping victim was not released until October. Approximately 30 Nigerian soldiers were killed in June when gunmen attacked a mine in Niger State. The following month, armed men attacked a group of soldiers at a checkpoint on a highway between Abuja and Kaduna, killing at least three and wounding several others.Various vigilante groups are active in Nigeria. The National Assembly unsuccessfully attempted to give official recognition to the Vigilante Group of Nigeria (VGN) in 2017 and 2019. In November 2021, the lower house passed a bill to extend official powers to the VGN.",0,"Despite constitutional safeguards against ethnic discrimination, many ethnic minorities experience bias by state governments and other societal groups in areas including employment, education, and housing.Women are subject to widespread societal discrimination regarding matters such as education and employment. Many poor families choose to send sons to school while daughters become street vendors or domestic workers. Women also face significant legal disadvantages in states governed by Sharia statutes.LGBT+ Nigerians face widespread official and societal discrimination. Nigerians convicted of engaging in same-sex relationships can be imprisoned for as long as 14 years, while 12 northern states maintain the death penalty for same-sex relations. LGBT+ people are also subject to assault by police officers during arrests, extortion attempts, and discrimination when accessing public and private services. A 2019 survey showed widespread opposition to LGBT+ rights, with 74 percent of respondents supporting prison sentences for those engaging in same-sex activity. In January 2022, one person was killed when a gay wedding was attacked in Abuja. In December, Sharia police raided the wedding party of a same-sex couple, arresting 19 people in Kano State.

A 2021 UN report noted that forced labor and torture are rampant in the prison system, and that citizens often pay bribes to avoid arrest, mitigate treatment in detention, and secure family visits.Defectors who seek safety in third countries are sometimes returned to North Korea, where they face torture and disproportionate punishment. China’s government considers North Korean escapees to be irregular economic migrants and regularly turns them back, violating international law. The unresolved conflict with South Korea around North Korea’s nuclear weapons program poses a threat to physical security, and negotiations with Seoul and Washington remained stalled in 2022. North Korea launched at least 95 missiles during the year, the most ever. The country notably fired an advanced intercontinental ballistic missile, which landed in waters west of Japan, in November. In September, Pyongyang codified its nuclear weapons strategy, allowing for their automatic use in certain circumstances but favoring deterrence in others.",0,"Discrimination is commonly based on perceived political and ideological nonconformity. All citizens are classified according to their family’s level of loyalty and proximity to the leadership under a semihereditary caste-like system known as songbun. Those who are classified as “wavering” or “hostile” instead of “loyal” face official discrimination in employment, live in poorer housing, and receive limited educational opportunities, though rules can be manipulated through bribery. Relatives of suspected political and ideological dissidents, including defectors, are also subject to punishment in what amounts to guilt by association.The country’s ethnic Chinese population has limited educational and employment opportunities, but somewhat more freedom of travel and trade. Women have legal equality but face rigid discrimination in practice and are poorly represented in public employment and the military. Despite fewer opportunities in the formal sector, women are economically active in markets, which can expose them to arbitrary state interference.The law does not explicitly prohibit same-sex relations, but the regime maintains that the practice does not exist in the country.North Korea has historically denied the rights of people living with disabilities. Defectors report that disabled people have been quarantined, exiled, forcibly sterilized, experimented on, and sometimes executed.",0
north-macedonia,"Concerns remain about the efficacy and independence of the judiciary. The EU has stressed judicial reforms as a key priority for North Macedonia’s accession bid.The European Commission (EC)’s October 2022 report noted that North Macedonia had made some progress in enacting its judicial reform strategy, and called on Skopje to continue implementing judicial reforms. The judiciary is the least-trusted public institution in North Macedonia, according to recent polls. According to a 2022 survey sponsored by the International Republican Institution (IRI), only 4 percent of North Macedonia’s respondents. said they trusted the judiciary greatly, while 19 percent only “somewhat” trust it.",2,"Due process rights remain compromised by corruption and patronage within the justice system. Political interference in the work of prosecutors remains a problem, while judicial culture remains highly corrupt. The selective application of justice also persists, although some reforms intended to ameliorate the issue have been carried out.The EC October 2022 report noted some progress in adjudicating corruption cases. However, cases related to the 2015 illegal wiretapping scandal remain unresolved.",2,"The threat of physical violence is generally low. While interethnic violence does occur in North Macedonia, such incidents have lessened in recent years.",3,"While the SDSM-led government passed a comprehensive antidiscrimination law in 2020, in practice societal discrimination against some groups persists. Anti-Albanian sentiment is still prevalent in some circles. The Romany population faces significant discrimination. Laws prohibit workplace sexual harassment, but many instances go unreported. The rights of the LGBT+ individuals are limited. The US State Department Human Rights Report for 2022 noted that violence against LGBT+ individuals remains a problem in North Macedonia, and that local NGOs report that authorities often fail to investigate it adequately.",2
norway,"The judiciary is generally considered independent, and the court system, headed by the Supreme Court, operates fairly. The king appoints judges on the advice of the Judicial Appointments Board, which is composed of legal and judicial professionals as well as representatives of the public. In April 2021, then–prime minister Erna Solberg was fined for breaching COVID-19 rules. She paid the fine and apologized for her actions.Additionally, in May 2021, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) court found that since Norway became an EFTA member in 1994, the government had illegally denied welfare payments to people who had traveled to other EFTA countries while receiving benefits. The Norwegian Supreme Court confirmed that authorities had acted unlawfully in a July 2021 ruling.",4,"Law enforcement agencies and the courts generally observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. Criminal defendants have access to counsel at the government’s expense, and the principles of due process are typically respected during trial.",4,"The police are under civilian control, and physical abuse by law enforcement is rare.

In June 2022, a person armed with a gun started shooting outside bars in central Oslo, particularly targeting people emerging out of a well-known gay bar. Twenty-one people were injured and two people were killed. Police declared it to be a “terrorist attack” and “hate crime.”",4,"Laws, policies, and practices guarantee equal treatment of various segments of the population, including for LGBT+ people. However, the shooting at a gay bar in June 2022 pushed the government to create a four-year action plan focused on improving LGBT+ people’s quality of life.The equality and antidiscrimination ombudsman enforces the Gender Equality Act, the Antidiscrimination Act, and other laws designed to protect the basic rights of women, minorities, and other groups at risk of mistreatment. These laws are generally upheld in practice. However, in a February 2021 report, the CoE recommended that Norwegian authorities put more resources into supporting victims of discrimination, particularly Roma people.Norwegian authorities reported a seven percent increase in hate crimes between 2020 and 2021, the majority of which were based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. The national government also supports Sámi-language instruction and media outlets in the relevant regions.

pakistan,"The country’s politicized judiciary has often been involved in power struggles between the military, the civilian government, and opposition politicians. In effect, it acts as a center of political power in its own right, though it is often aligned with the military and cooperates with it in curtailing the powers of civilian politicians.The judiciary was involved in the struggle over Imran Khan’s premiership in 2022. In April, it ruled against Khan’s efforts to dissolve the parliament to avoid a no-confidence vote. The judiciary addressed corruption allegations against PML-N and PPP leaders while the PTI was in power, but it pivoted to address accusations made against Khan and the PTI after Khan’s ouster. Proceedings against Khan’s political opponents were not dropped, however.The broader court system is marred by endemic problems including corruption, intimidation, insecurity, a large backlog of cases, and low conviction rates for serious crimes.",1,"Police have long been accused of biased or arbitrary handling of initial criminal complaints. Police and prosecutors have been criticized for a chronic failure to prosecute terrorism cases and for their reliance on torture. The National Assembly in 2022 failed to ban torture via legislation, despite the Senate passing draft legislation in 2021. No standardized definition consequently exists, nor is there a comprehensive mechanism to monitor security agencies.Under the Army Act, the military operates its own courts, primarily for its own personnel. However, the army has asserted the right to selectively try civilians in national security cases.There has been progress in women’s access to justice and generalized protection of rights for litigants in the former FATAs, which now lie within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Informal jirgas remain a form of local dispute resolution alongside the formal justice system.",1,"Most terrorist violence has historically been connected to three distinct conflicts. A low-intensity insurgency in Baluchistan pits the Baloch Liberation Army and other Baloch separatist outfits against the state. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the TTP conducts attacks against security forces, often launching them from within Afghanistan. The TTP escalated its activities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan after ending a cease-fire in November 2022. The local branch of the Islamic State militant group, Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), also attacks targets in Pakistan, though it has prioritized its campaign in Afghanistan.In 2022, 971 people—a figure that includes civilians, security forces, and terrorists—were killed in terrorist incidents, an increase of almost 50 percent over 2021. These figures remain far lower than the 2009 figure of 11,317. In March 2022, 63 worshippers died in a suicide attack on a Shia mosque in Peshawar. The ISKP claimed responsibility. In December, TTP militants held in a police facility in Bannu overcame their captors, precipitating a siege. The army stormed the facility to end the siege; 33 militants and 2 commandos were killed in the fighting according to Defense Minister Khawaja Asif.State actors engage in extralegal violence against civilians, including enforced disappearances. Most victims are from Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, or former FATAs.  Victims typically are held incommunicado by security and intelligence agencies on suspicion of antistate agitation, terrorism, rebellion, or espionage. The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, an advocacy NGO, accused the state of operating “death squads” to abduct and kill suspected separatist sympathizers. In September 2022, Islamabad High Court chief justice Athar Minallah admonished the government over its inability to address enforced disappearances. The official Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances logged 9,203 cases of missing persons as of December 30 and said that it resolved 7,001. In October 2022, the National Assembly passed an amended bill to criminalize enforced disappearances. However, the bill failed to establish an oversight mechanism for state agencies responsible for enforced disappearances, nor did it curtail the army’s power to hold civilians under the Army Act.",1,"Women face discrimination in employment despite legal protections and are placed at a disadvantage under personal status laws. Perpetrators of gender-based violence and sexual harassment or discrimination often enjoy impunity. Individuals must register a “first information report” of a crime, and police are often reluctant to pursue complaints of crimes against women, including so-called crimes of honor.Ethnic and religious minorities, Afghan refugees, and LGBT+ people suffer legal or de facto discrimination and violence. The penal code prescribes prison terms for consensual sex “against the order of nature,” deterring LGBT+ people from acknowledging their identity or reporting abuses. Transgender and intersex people are authorized to register for official documents under a “third gender” classification recognized by the Supreme Court since 2009, and some transgender people were recognized in the 2017 census.

Tourism from China in particular has created jobs but also raised the cost of living, and some locals regard the presence of Chinese businesses and residents with hostility; media investigations have raised concerns about links between Chinese business interests and both the Chinese government and organized crime. However, the number of Chinese tourists has fallen in recent years due to Chinese state policy.",3
panama,"The country’s judicial system is plagued by corruption and inefficiency. Public disagreements between the Prosecutor General’s Office and judges over rulings that impeded major corruption cases in recent years have raised doubts about whether such cases would be heard impartially.

An influx of migrants and asylum seekers from Venezuela, Cuba, and other troubled countries in the region has stoked anti-immigrant sentiment in recent years. The number of migrants illegally crossing the Darién Gap, on the border between Panama and Colombia, reached a record high in 2022. Official statistics show that over 248,000 migrants entered Panama via the Darién Gap during the year 2022.

In recent years, the higher courts have repeatedly demonstrated their impartiality by ruling against the government and its political interests, for instance when ordering Parliament to assemble and vote on no-confidence motions.",3,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are poorly upheld. Arbitrary detention is relatively common, and opportunities to challenge such abuses are limited in practice.

Prison conditions are poor, and the correctional service is understaffed. Prison breaks are common. Lack of economic opportunities exacerbates social unrest, frequently resulting in violent clashes, injuries, and deaths. Tribal violence and “payback” attacks are common in the Highlands Region. In July 2022, some 25 people were killed in tribal fighting in the Porgera area of Enga Province. A state of emergency had been declared for the area in May. According to the United Nations and local officials, an estimated 90,000 people were displaced by violence in the Highlands from May to September 2022. Capital punishment was most recently reintroduced in 1991, though no executions have been carried out since 1954. In January 2022, Parliament voted to abolish the death penalty.",1,"The constitution guarantees equality regardless of race, tribe, religion, sex, and other categories, but various forms of discrimination are common in practice. Same-sex sexual relations are a criminal offense that can draw up to 14 years in prison, though the relevant laws are rarely enforced. There is some discrimination against people of Chinese origin; a growing Chinese business presence in the country has drawn resentment for allegedly disadvantaging other groups. Women face legal discrimination in employment in addition to societal biases. Allegations of sorcery have been used to target women for violence.Australia long paid the PNG government to accept asylum seekers who arrived in Australian waters by boat, but as the program wound down in recent years, those who were not granted refugee status or did not agree to settle in PNG were left in limbo, living in difficult conditions. The Australian government formally ended its regional processing contract with PNG at the close of 2021, and the PNG government agreed to offer measures including citizenship and family reunification for any remaining asylum seekers who wished to reside in the country. While the Australian government was still reluctant to allow transfers to Australia, some of the asylum seekers have been sent to the United States as part of a deal between Canberra and Washington.

peru,"The judiciary has been perceived as one of the most corrupt institutions in the country. In 2018, Congress approved a reform leading to the creation of a new National Board of Justice (JNJ) in charge of selecting, evaluating, and disciplining judges. The establishment of the JNJ was widely praised by civil society organizations as well as academia.Peru’s seven-member Constitutional Court has maintained sufficient autonomy to serve as a check on the other branches, and the constant tension between Congress and the executive heightens the importance of both the Court’s composition and its decisions. Indeed, observers pointed to the process of appointing six new justices as a key driver of interbranch tensions leading up to the November 2020 political crisis. However, in July 2021, a Peruvian court ordered the selection of new Constitutional Court members to be suspended due to alleged irregularities in the selection process. Despite the ruling, Congress announced that the selection process would go ahead as planned, prompting the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) to urge the legislature to abide by judicial rulings.In October of 2022, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice, Elvia Barrios, accused an unnamed member of the public prosecutor’s office of intimidation right before a planned visit by Organization of American States (OAS) officials to assess the political situation in the country. A preliminary OAS report on the visit, released in November, recommended the “strengthening of constitutional justice” in Peru.",2,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are unevenly upheld.

A report published in 2021 by the National Statistics Institute (INEI) indicated that between November 2020 and April 2021, 18.6 percent of Peruvians aged 15 and over in urban areas were victimized by crime and 82.3 percent nationwide believed they would be victims of a crime. More than 172,000 criminal complaints were made to authorities between January and March 2022, marking a 101.5 percent increase compared to the same period in 2021.Abuses committed by the security forces are rarely punished. In March 2020, Congress passed a law that international rights groups criticized as generating additional barriers to police accountability.The December 2022 protests across Peru featured high levels of violence by security forces using lethal force—including live ammunition—against protesters. International human rights groups have condemned the use of force by authorities as disproportionate; in one incident in Ayacucho, military forces killed nine protesters, including a teenage boy. Violent clashes between security forces and demonstrators continued through year’s end.",2,"Discrimination against Indigenous populations and Afro-Peruvians is pervasive. LGBT+ people face discrimination, hostility, and violence. Indigenous Peruvians, who often live vast distances from under-resourced health services, were severely afflicted by COVID-19, while transgender Peruvians were subjected to police abuse during the lockdown.In November 2022, the government issued an official apology to Azul Rojas Marín, a transgender woman who had been raped and beaten by a group of police officers in 2008. The apology was among a number of reparations mandated by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), which in 2020 found the Peruvian state guilty of violating Rojas’s human rights.After Colombia, Peru has received the highest number of migrants from Venezuela. While the country was initially welcoming, public opinion shifted against tolerance, and a 2019 report by the Ministry of the Interior found that more than half of the Venezuelans residing in Peru have felt or experienced discrimination. Disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic posed additional problems for Venezuelan migrants, who were not eligible for key forms of state assistance. In January 2021, the government militarized the northern border with Ecuador in an attempt to prevent undocumented immigrants from entering the country.",2
philippines,"Judicial independence deteriorated during the Duterte administration, during which authorities launched several attempts to remove Supreme Court justices seen as political opponents. One such attempt involved claims that Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, a critic of the former president, had failed to disclose assets—and was successful in achieving her removal. Judicial independence is also hampered by inefficiency, low pay, intimidation, corruption, and high vacancy rates. Since 2016, at least nine retired or former judges and justices and 14 former and current city prosecutors have been killed. In 2022, several courts displayed increased independence from the executive branch. In September, Judge Marlo Magdoza-Malagar of the Manila Regional Trial Court dismissed a case brought by the Justice Department that sought to declare the CPP a terrorist organization. In response, the former spokesperson of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, created under the Duterte administration, threatened Magdoza-Malagar with violence and death. The Supreme Court denounced the threat and further ordered the spokesperson to explain why she should not be cited for contempt. Courts have also recently returned corruption convictions against police officers and other public officials, and invalidated a broadly worded section of the Duterte administration’s much-criticized Anti-Terrorism Act. Despite these positive developments, some courts continue to deliver politicized verdicts favoring the executive. ",2,"The Anti-Terrorism Act that took effect in July 2020 provides the state significant powers, including for the warrantless arrest and detention of people designated as terrorists by the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC), which is appointed by the president. Rights advocates have sharply criticized the law’s broad definition of terrorism and warned of the potential for misuse, and dozens of lawsuits have challenged the law’s constitutionality. In 2021, the Supreme Court declared the section of the Anti-Terrorism Act that defined “terrorism” unconstitutional, saying it was overbroad and could result in the criminalization of legitimate actions like protests and strikes.In 2022, a number of lower courts, the Court of Appeals, and the Sandiganbayan (anticorruption court) convicted or upheld the convictions of police officers, including the former chief of police, for involvement in kidnapping, murder, and graft in procurement contracts. Separately, in August 2022, the Supreme Court issued an order to the military to submit documents proving that two activists who had gone missing in May had not been illegally arrested or detained. In September, the Court of Appeals found the military accountable for the disappearance of the two.",1,"The Philippines remains affected by insurgencies and violent extremism, notably in Mindanao.During his administration, Duterte waged a violent war on drugs that involved extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, and torture of detainees. President Marcos has stated that he intends to take a different approach to the war on drugs. In August 2022, he appointed Rodolfo Azurin Jr.— who was not among the high-ranking officials associated with Duterte’s drug war—as chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), while PNP generals believed to be implicated in extrajudicial killings were reassigned to less-important positions. Azurin in September 2022 publicly stated that police should investigate crimes and identify suspects rather than resorting to violence to address the country’s drug problems. The statement came shortly after Vice President Sara Duterte had met with leaders of national security forces while Marcos was in Indonesia, and announced that the government should crack down on criminality.Nevertheless, according to a November 2022 HRW report, extrajudicial killings under the Marcos administration persist and the PNP has underreported deaths during police operations, and the level of impunity for state actors remains the same. Human rights appear to be a low priority for the Marcos administration. In his inaugural state-of-the-nation address in July 2022, the president did not mention human rights at all. In September he appointed two commissioners to the Commission on Human Rights, and left three seats unfilled.",1,"Provisions mandating equal treatment are upheld inconsistently, and some groups lack legal protection. LGBT+ people face bias in employment, education, and other services, as well as societal discrimination. An antidiscrimination bill that passed the lower house in 2017 has not yet become law, though Senator Hontiveros renewed her call to pass it in 2022. Several cities, including Manila, have passed ordinances recognizing LGBT+ rights and prohibiting acts of discrimination. In the absence of national legislation, transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals cannot alter birth identification documents.According to the World Economic Forum, the Philippines features one of the smallest gender-pay gaps in the world. Women’s educational attainment outpaces men’s, and women are well represented in professional roles. However, women still face some credit constraints and employment discrimination, and the political realm remains dominated by men, with women occupying less than 30 percent of national and local elective positions.Indigenous rights are generally upheld, but land disputes and local development projects regularly cause friction and sometimes lead to violence. Indigenous people often live in conflict areas and are targeted by combatants for their perceived loyalties.The law mandates that at least 1 percent of public jobs be reserved for people with disabilities, but this is poorly upheld.",1
poland,"Since taking power in 2015, PiS has asserted control over the judiciary, passing legislation designed to curb the powers of the TK and to install progovernment judges on its benches. New, lower retirement ages for the Supreme Court took effect in 2018; 27 judges were effectively forced to step down but were reinstated after the European Commission (EC) launched an infringement procedure and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that the measures violated European law. Under measures that took effect in 2018, 15 of the KRS’s members would be appointed by Parliament and not elected by fellow judges.A law on the Supreme Court created powerful new chambers, including the Disciplinary Chamber (ID). The EC later launched infringement procedures, saying that the ID undermined judicial independence. In July 2021, the ECJ ordered a suspension of the ID’s activities, a ruling Warsaw ignored. On the same day that the ECJ made its ruling, the TK said that the ECJ’s interim measures conflicted with the constitution. That October, the ECJ imposed a daily one-million-euro penalty against Warsaw, which remained in effect as of November 2022. Also in October 2021, the TK ruled that some parts of EU law were incompatible with the constitution. The EC responded by launching another infringement procedure, arguing that the TK’s rulings had violated EU law.Individual judges have also been scrutinized, suspended, or transferred to other courts for questioning the government. In August 2022, for example, Warsaw criminal judge Marzanna Piekarska-Drążek was transferred to another court after she had questioned the government’s judicial appointments.Concerns over judicial independence persisted in 2022. In March, the TK supported the Justice Ministry’s assessment that the right to a fair trial as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights was unconstitutional. The Sejm voted to abolish the ID in May, with the Professional Liability Chamber taking on some of its functions; opposition lawmakers called the changes cosmetic. In June, the Supreme Court’s criminal chamber ruled that the KRS no longer abided by its constitutional purpose due to political interference, a claim PiS rejected. In December, Warsaw said it had agreed on legislative amendments that would address the EU’s rule-of-law concerns, though President Duda said that a judicial reform bill would not be debated immediately. In December 2022, the Sejm passed a law that would stop criminal proceedings of government officials who supplied voter lists to the post office without a legal basis before the 2020 presidential election. The law also provides for the erasure of already-rendered court convictions on the matter. The law was criticized for granting Parliament the power to supersede final court decisions, violating separation of powers.",1,"Defendants generally enjoy due process protections in Poland, though the law allows for extended pretrial detention, and a large backlog of cases exists. The use of pretrial detention has significantly increased since the PiS came to power.The PiS government’s decision to merge the roles of justice minister and prosecutor general “creates potential for misuses and political manipulation” of the justice system, according to the Venice Commission. Legislation introduced in 2016 gave law enforcement agencies broad authority to monitor citizens’ communications, including the ability to access metadata without a court order, monitor the movements of foreign citizens without prior court approval, and hold terrorism suspects without charge for up to two weeks. It also contained ambiguous provisions on collecting individuals’ data, arresting civilians, prohibiting demonstrations, and blocking internet access.",3,"Civilians are largely free from extralegal violence, though incidents of abuse by police have been alleged particularly in the context of antigovernment demonstrations. Human rights groups have reported inadequate medical care in prison facilities.People in Poland have generally remained unaffected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, two people when a missile struck farmland near the village of Przewodów in November. Preliminary findings suggested the strike was unintentional and that the missile may have been launched by Ukrainian forces.",4,"Women and ethnic minority groups generally enjoy equality before the law.LGBT+ people continue to face discrimination. While public support for LGBT+ rights has risen in recent years, PiS has stoked fears of “imported LGBT ideology” by mounting an intense anti-LGBT+ campaign. By the end of 2020, more than 100 local governments had declared themselves “LGBT-ideology-free” zones or established “family charters,” in resolutions without specific legal implications that rights groups described as hateful toward LGBT+ people. Warsaw asked local authorities to repeal their anti-LGBT+ resolutions in 2021, after the EU threatened to withdraw funding from towns that had adopted them. In June 2022, the Supreme Administrative Court ordered four municipalities to revoke their declarations, though many of them persist.Because Poland’s law against inciting hatred does not cover crimes motivated by sexuality or gender identity, public figures have been free to make slurs that would be prosecuted if targeted at other marginalized groups.In October 2021, Parliament authorized border guards to forcibly expel migrants who had crossed into the country illegally, after Belarusian security forces stranded migrants and asylum seekers who then crossed the border into Poland. The situation, which the Belarusian regime engineered in an effort to force the EU to reverse sanctions against it, trapped thousands of people between the two countries. The United Nations and human rights organizations were denied access to the border zone and criticized Warsaw’s policy of “illegal pushbacks.” In June, the country’s Commissioner for Human Rights reported that migrants’ right to health care had been systematically violated in closed detention centers. At least 27 people died in the border zone as of November 2022.The pushback policy continued for at least part of 2022, though Polish courts called it unlawful in June and September rulings. A border wall, which was largely completed when the state of emergency was lifted in July, was constructed to restrict the flow of people from Belarus.The national government, local bodies, and citizens offered significant support to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In March 2022, the Sejm passed legislation granting significant rights, including labor-market access, to Ukrainian refugees. However, the legislation does not apply to stateless persons arriving from Ukraine, who enjoy less protection. Warsaw attempted to cut allowances to refugees and to their Polish hosts in June, a policy that was not enacted due to widespread local opposition. Under a government proposal announced in November, some Ukrainian refugees would be responsible for more housing and food costs beginning in March 2023. Some 1.4 million people registered for temporary protection in Poland as of October 2022, the highest figure among EU member states.",2
portugal,"The judiciary is generally independent, though GRECO and the European Commission in their 2022 reports called for more effective efforts to combat corruption and improve efficiency in the justice system. A series of scandals in the judiciary have led to prosecutions in recent years. In September 2022, for example, the Supreme Court began hearing the trial of three former judges who were accused of corruption and abuse of power, among other charges.",4,"The authorities generally observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention, though court backlogs result in lengthy pretrial detention for some defendants. Due process rights are guaranteed during trial.Controversy surrounding the government’s 2020 appointment of José Guerra to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) continued into 2022. Guerra had been supported by Portugal’s High Council of Public Prosecutors, but a European committee of experts preferred another candidate, Ana Carla Almeida, for the post. Critics of the appointment alleged that it was politically motivated, noting that the government had included false information in its submission on Guerra’s qualifications. The European Union’s General Court in Luxembourg in 2021 rejected a request submitted by Almeida to annul Guerra’s appointment. Almeida appealed the decision, but the court dismissed the appeal in June 2022.",4,"While the population is generally free from serious threats to physical security, human rights groups and the Council of Europe have expressed concern over abuse of detainees and excessive use of force by police, particularly against members of racial and ethnic minority groups. Overcrowding in prisons remains a problem, as do poor health and safety conditions. SOS Racismo Portugal, an NGO, issued a statement in March 2022 to denounce the deaths of three inmates under unclear circumstances since September 2021. Separately, in January 2022, five military police officers were suspended for the alleged torture of migrant workers.",3,"Equal treatment under the law is guaranteed by the constitution. Various laws prohibit discrimination based on factors including sex, race, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Nevertheless, problems persist with respect to gender bias—including in employment and compensation—and discrimination against members of minority groups, particularly Roma and people of African descent.Racism and racist violence have become more prominent issues in the public discourse, due in part to growing support for far-right groups. Among other obstacles, Black residents are subject to disparities in housing, education, and employment. A 2019 study from the European Network Against Racism (ENAR) found “deeply rooted institutional” discrimination at every stage of the judicial process, from reporting through sentencing.Discrimination against Roma remains common and rarely punished. Living conditions in Romany communities are generally poor, Romany children face segregation and poor educational outcomes in schools, and Romany adults experience high rates of unemployment.",3
qatar,"Despite constitutional guarantees, the judiciary is not independent in practice. Many judges are foreign nationals serving under temporary contracts that are renewed annually. The Supreme Council of the Judiciary, composed of senior judges, administers the courts and plays a role in nominating judges for appointment by the emir.",1,"Certain laws allow lengthy detentions without charge or access to a lawyer for suspects in cases involving national security or terrorism. Even under normal criminal procedure, judges can extend pretrial detention for up to half of the maximum prison term allowed for the alleged crime. Many laws contain ill-defined offenses and other language that gives prosecutors and judges broad discretion to determine guilt. The 2021 arrests and 2022 prosecutions of Qatari human rights lawyers Hazza al-Marri and Rashed al-Marri were marked by pronounced due process violations. The brothers were reportedly denied access to legal representation while being interrogated, and were ultimately sentenced to life in prison in a closed-door trial in May 2022. Their sentences were upheld upon appeal in October.",1,"Violent crime is rare in Qatar, and prison conditions reportedly meet international standards. Legal bans on torture and other mistreatment of detainees have generally been respected in recent years, though international experts have called for further legislative and other improvements. The death penalty is permitted, including for crimes other than murder.",3,"Noncitizens reportedly face discrimination in the courts and from police. Though the constitution bars gender-based discrimination, women are not legally guaranteed equal treatment, and their testimony is worth less than that of men in certain cases. LGBT+ people are subject to legal and societal discrimination; vague wording in the penal code can be interpreted to criminalize same-sex sexual activity, and Sharia prohibits any sexual acts outside of heterosexual marriage. Same-sex relationships must be hidden in practice. LGBT+ people have reported being arbitrarily detained and violently assaulted by security officials.Asylum seekers and recognized refugees are barred from engaging in political activity and need government approval to change their place of residence. An asylum committee began receiving applications in 2019, though some asylum seekers reportedly continued to be threatened with deportation, casting doubt on the implementation of the law.",0
romania,"The judiciary is generally independent and progress in this area was reflected in the lifting of the CVM by the European Commission in November 2022. Nevertheless, the judiciary continues to face pressure from the executive and legislative branches. A special prosecution unit focusing on magistrates was disbanded by a March 2022 law; the unit had been criticized by magistrates’ associations and supranational bodies, who feared it would allow for the intimidation of magistrates and other abuses. However, the European Commission for Democracy Through Law criticized the haste with which the law was passed and expressed concern about the efficacy of the systems replacing the controversial unit.In August 2022, the government adopted new justice laws in spite of major criticism from the judiciary and civil society that the laws would diminish judicial independence. Prime Minister Ciucă pushed for the laws, saying they would bring the CVM for Romania to an end and would facilitate the country’s accession to the Schengen Area.",3,"The law provides safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention which are generally respected. However, the right to a fair and timely trial is often undermined by institutional problems including corruption, political influence, staffing shortages, and inefficient resource allocation. Many government officials and lawmakers have retained their positions despite criminal indictments or convictions by exploiting such weaknesses in the system. The hearing of noncriminal matters remained slower in 2022 than it was before the pandemic.",3,"The population faces no major threats to physical security, but prisons and detention centers feature harsh conditions, and the abuse of detainees by police and fellow prisoners remains a problem.",3,"The law provides broad protections against discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other categories. However, people with disabilities, LGBT+ people, Roma, and HIV-positive children and adults face discrimination in education, employment, medical service provision, and other areas. In July 2021, the AUR, which entered Parliament in 2020, announced that it was drafting a bill that would restrict the discussion of sexual orientation or identity in educational settings. In April 2022, the Senate passed a similar bill initiated by the UDMR, but the Chamber of Deputies had not scheduled a vote on the measure by year’s end.The constitution guarantees women equal rights, but gender discrimination remains a problem in many aspects of life.",3
russia,"The judiciary lacks independence from the executive branch, and judges’ career advancement is effectively tied to compliance with Kremlin preferences. The Presidential Personnel Commission and court chairpersons control the appointment of the country’s judges, who tend to be promoted from inside the judicial system rather than gaining independent experience as lawyers. The 2020 constitutional amendments empowered the president to remove judges from the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, with the support of the Federation Council, further narrowing the judiciary’s already negligible autonomy.",1,"Safeguards against arbitrary arrest and other due process guarantees are regularly violated, particularly for individuals who oppose or are perceived as threatening to the interests of the regime and its allies. Many Russians have consequently sought justice from international courts, but a 2015 law authorizes the Russian judiciary to overrule the decisions of such bodies. In June 2022, the Duma voted to retroactively end ECtHR jurisdiction, closing another legal option for Russians. Under legislation signed in 2021, police officers have broad authority to break into homes and vehicles and search personal belongings without a warrant. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe reported in May 2022 that there were 447 political prisoners in Russia, 360 of them held in connection with the exercise of religious freedom.",1,"Use of excessive force by police is widespread, and rights groups have reported that law enforcement agents who carry out such abuses have deliberately employed electric shocks, suffocation, and the stretching of a detainee’s body so as to avoid leaving visible injuries.Chechen leader Kadyrov has been accused of using abductions, torture, extrajudicial killings, and other forms of violence to maintain control. Kadyrov is also suspected of arranging the assassination of asylum seekers and opponents-in-exile in other parts of Russia and abroad.Many men conscripted to fight in Ukraine following the February 2022 invasion were reportedly coerced into signing service contracts, and there were reports of military personnel being misled about whether they would be sent to Ukraine. Those who refused to fight risked detention and mistreatment; some objectors were reportedly threatened with execution. In Chechnya, authorities have used threats, blackmail, and intimidation to force locals to “volunteer” for military service in Ukraine.Violent incidents were also reported during the September mobilization drive. An officer was shot and gravely wounded at an enlistment office in the city of Ust-Ilimsk that month. In October, 11 soldiers were killed in a Belgorod facility, with the Defense Ministry claiming that 2 volunteers were responsible.Russia proper was affected by the war during the year, with Ukrainian forces attacking military assets within Russian territory on several occasions. In December 2022, for example, three people were killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Engels air base in Saratov Oblast.Prisons are overcrowded and unsanitary; inmates lack health-care access and are subject to abuse by guards. Prisoners have also been solicited and coerced to fight in Ukraine. In November, Putin signed amended legislation allowing for the conscription of recently released prisoners.",0,"Immigrants and ethnic minorities—particularly those who appear to be from the Caucasus or Central Asia—face governmental and societal discrimination and harassment; local NGOs and officials reported that ethnic minorities were disproportionately targeted in the mobilization drive that began in September 2022. Constitutional amendments establish the primacy of the Russian language within the state, favoring ethnic Russians by implication.LGBT+ people are subject to considerable discrimination. Under a 2013 law that was amended in December 2022, the promotion of “nontraditional sexual relations and/or preferences” is banned. The original law banned the promotion of “nontraditional lifestyles” to minors.Chechnya remains particularly dangerous for LGBT+ people. In February 2022, two Chechen LGBT+ siblings received prison sentences for “aiding illegal armed groups.” The siblings, who managed a Telegram channel critical of Chechen authorities, fled to the city of Nizhny Novgorod in 2020 but were abducted by Chechen police in 2021. Their sentences were upheld in October 2022. In July, Chechen police were filmed detaining three people in Grozny and interrogating at least one about same-sex activity. Two acquaintances reportedly disappeared soon after.In November 2022, Putin issued a decree allowing dual citizens, Russians with permanent-resident status in foreign countries, and stateless individuals to be conscripted.",0
rwanda,"Despite constitutional provisions that declare its independence, the Rwandan judiciary lacks autonomy from the executive in practice. Top judicial officials are appointed by the president and confirmed by the RPF-dominated Senate. Judges rarely rule against the government, especially in politically sensitive cases.",0,"The constitution affirms the right to due process, but the security services regularly engage in arbitrary arrests and detentions, targeting opposition figures and dissidents as well as homeless people, street vendors, and suspected petty criminals. Detainees are often held beyond the 72 hours allowed for those arrested without a warrant, denied access to legal counsel, and charged based on coerced confessions. Arbitrary detentions have intensified in Kigali ahead of international events such as the June 2022 Commonwealth summit, as authorities attempt to clear the streets of unhoused children, informal vendors, and sex workers, among others.The government is known to pursue arbitrary detentions of political opponents living in exile. In 2020, Rwandan authorities effectively abducted Paul Rusesabagina—a Belgian citizen, US resident, and regime critic known for sheltering hundreds of people during the genocide—while he was visiting the United Arab Emirates. Upon arrival in Rwanda, he was charged with supporting terrorism due to his leadership role in the opposition Rwanda Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD) and alleged links to the group’s armed wing. Rusesabagina was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2021 after a trial that lacked due process, and the verdict was upheld on appeal in April 2022.",1,"Both ordinary criminal suspects and political detainees are routinely subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in custody. Extrajudicial executions of suspected criminals by security personnel have been reported, as have disappearances, physical assaults, and assassinations targeting journalists, opposition members, and other regime critics. While such abuses remain a serious threat, the worst forms of violence against dissidents within the country appear to have grown less common than in some previous years.The Rwandan government allegedly supports rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwandan authorities have reported occasional clashes with Congolese soldiers or rebel fighters along the border. However, insurgent activity and violent crime on Rwandan territory are extremely rare, and the population seldom faces threats to physical security from nonstate actors.",1,"Equal treatment for all citizens under the law is guaranteed, and there are legal protections against discrimination. However, the Tutsi minority group allegedly receives preferential treatment in employment and education under the pretext of an affirmative action program for “genocide survivors.” There is a perception that English-speaking Tutsis are overrepresented in government. Members of the Hutu majority, who account for 85 percent of the population, reportedly face unofficial discrimination when seeking public employment or scholarships. The Twa, meanwhile, have long been marginalized and continue to suffer from de facto disadvantages in education, employment, and health care.While women enjoy broad legal equality and have a significant presence in the economy as workers and business owners, gender-based discrimination persists, especially in rural areas, and gender-equality measures have largely favored English-speaking Tutsis in urban areas. Same-sex sexual activity is not criminalized in Rwanda, though LGBT+ people face strong social stigma. No laws specifically provide protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and police can arrest individuals using public morality laws.",1

The government has attempted to address the problem through various means, including a “Peace Initiative,” whereby members of criminal groups were encouraged to move out of crime and into legal activities. Police have employed stop-and-search methods extensively.The government claims that violent crime has been decreasing; there were 11 recorded homicides in 2022, down significantly from the 2011 high of 35. Prisons remain overcrowded.",3,"The law protects individuals against discrimination on various grounds, including race, sex, and religion, and these provisions are generally upheld. However, sexual orientation and gender identity are not similarly protected, and societal discrimination against LGBT+ people is pervasive.Until recently, same-sex relations between men were illegal and punishable with imprisonment of up to 10 years under colonial-era laws. In August 2022, the ECSC ruled against two parts of the OPA that prohibited same-sex relations, saying that they violated the freedom of expression and right to privacy.No law specifically prohibits workplace sexual harassment.

There were 76 homicides in 2022, an all-time record; the country’s homicide rate per 100,000 people, which stood at 42.3, is among the highest in the Caribbean.St. Lucia has relied on the Regional Security System (RSS), a security initiative that includes St. Lucia and several other Caribbean states, to support law enforcement efforts. Personnel attached to the RSS were deployed in July 2022.Police brutality has been seen as a significant problem in St. Lucia. Members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force (RSLPF) are perceived to enjoy impunity for abusive behavior. In 2013, the United States cut aid to the RSLPF over allegations related to extrajudicial killings. Aid was restored in 2021 when Washington renewed security cooperation and assistance with some RSLPF units. The RSLPF participated in a US military–led regional joint exercise between March and May 2022, the first time it had done so since 2012.",3,"While discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, and other such grounds is generally prohibited, the law does not provide full protection to LGBT+ people. The labor code prohibits dismissal of employees based on sexual orientation. Under an ECSC directive, murders committed when sexual orientation is a motive can be punishable with a life sentence. Same-sex relations can draw up to 10 years in prison, though this criminal-code provision is reportedly not enforced. LGBT+ people face significant societal prejudice.Rastafarians face societal disadvantages due to their beliefs, and Muslims have reported harassment.",3
samoa,"The judiciary is independent, as demonstrated by its rulings during the postelection crisis in 2021. The head of state, on the recommendation of the prime minister, appoints the chief justice. Other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the head of state on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission, which is chaired by the chief justice and includes the attorney general and a Justice Ministry appointee. Judges typically serve until they reach retirement age and cannot be removed arbitrarily.The three reform bills adopted in December 2020 featured several provisions that could undermine judicial independence and the rule of law. One component allows the head of state, on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission, to dismiss Supreme Court judges; this had previously required a two-thirds vote in the parliament, which is still required to remove the chief justice. The legislation also separates the judicial system into two distinct and potentially conflicting structures, with one, headed by the Supreme Court, handling civil and criminal matters and the other, the Land and Titles Court, overseeing customary matters including communal land. The Land and Titles Court would have its own appellate body, and individuals would no longer be able to appeal its decisions to the Supreme Court.The impasse over the legal status of the Land and Titles Court (LTC) has rendered that court unable to validate new judicial and administrative appointments. In February 2022, the president of the LTC sought Supreme Court intervention to validate the swearing-in of three of its judges. In April 2022, the Supreme Court granted the LTC president the ability to conduct affairrs, but left the ultimate resolution of the judges’ appointments to Parliament. In November, Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata‘afa announced the appointment of a new LTC president, Lesatele Rapi Vaai, who was formerly a Supremem Court justice. Fepuleai Attiila Ropati, who was replaced as court president by Vaai, filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, claiming that he had been unduly removed without following proper protocols.",4,"The authorities generally observe due process safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention, and the courts provide defendants with the conditions necessary for a fair trial. However, village councils settle many disputes, and their adherence to due process standards varies; they have the authority to impose penalties including fines and banishment. The December 2020 legal reforms appeared to eliminate individuals’ ability to appeal village council decisions to the Supreme Court, raising doubts about how conflicts between customary communal authority and the constitutional rights of individuals would be resolved.",3,"Violent crime rates are relatively low. Police officers are occasionally accused of physical abuse. Prisons lack adequate resources, resulting in poor conditions including overcrowding, as well as breakdowns in security.",4,"The constitution prohibits discrimination based on descent, sex, religion, and other categories. The Labour and Employment Relations Act also prohibits discrimination against employees on such grounds as ethnicity, race, color, sex, gender, religion, political opinion, sexual orientation, social origin, marital status, pregnancy, HIV status, and disability. However, these protections are enforced unevenly. In practice women face some discrimination in employment and other aspects of life, and same-sex sexual activity remains a criminal offense for men. Ethnic Chinese residents at times encounter societal bias and restrictions on the location of their businesses.Fa‘afafine were previously subject to a rarely enforced criminal code provision that prohibited the “impersonation” of a woman. A 2013 amendment removed that provision, but fa‘afafine and other gender-diverse Samoans continue to face a degree of societal discrimination in practice.",3
san-marino,"Judicial affairs are managed by a Judicial Council made up of judges and lay members. In 2020, the government adopted legislation that altered the voting structure within the Judicial Council, giving greater influence to members of parliament sitting on the council. The body subsequently removed three judges who had been investigating the Conto Mazzini case. In response, GRECO called for structural changes to limit political interference with the judiciary. The parliament adopted reforms in December 2021 that were designed to strengthen judicial independence, including provisions that prohibited lawmakers from serving on the Judicial Council, required the council’s lay members to have specific legal education or experience, and called for those members to be elected by a two-thirds majority in the parliament; the judges on the council are elected by their peers. In June 2022, GRECO expressed its satisfaction with these reforms as well as the judicial code of ethics that was adopted by the reorganized Judicial Council in March.",4,"Due process rights surrounding charges and trials are generally upheld in practice. The authorities respect legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. The 2020 GRECO report on San Marino’s judiciary expressed concerns about the lack of professionalism and transparency in the system, and called for a more consistent, objective, and transparent allocation of cases. In March 2022, the parliament passed amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and other legislation that provided for an objective and systematic allocation of cases, strengthened the protection of defendants’ rights, and set rules for the recusal of judges who have conflicts of interest.",4,"The population does not face any major threats to physical security. There is one prison in San Marino, and the inmate population is small, with no reports of serious mistreatment.

However, discrimination based on skin color and language are not covered by these provisions, and the country lacks a strong and comprehensive legal framework for combating discrimination more broadly. A 2019 constitutional amendment banned all forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation, but it does not cover gender identity, and it is not supported by specific, enforceable laws addressing employment and other forms of discrimination affecting LGBT+ people.

saudi-arabia,"The judiciary has very little independence in practice. Judges are appointed by the king and overseen by the Supreme Judicial Council, whose chairman is also the justice minister. A special commission of judicial experts issues opinions that serve as guidelines for judges on the interpretation of Sharia (Islamic law), which forms the basis of Saudi law. Judges have significant discretion over how they interpret Sharia and do not have to publish an explanation of their judgments.In what appeared to be a political purge of the judiciary in April 2022, state security officials arrested nine prominent judges on charges of “high treason.”",1,"Defendants’ rights are poorly protected by law. Detainees are often denied access to legal counsel during interrogation, and lengthy pretrial detention and detention without charge are common. Due process is notably deficient in death penalty cases. Statistics and other information on prisoners, sometimes including their whereabouts or reason for arrest, are lacking. The number of political prisoners is difficult to assess, with some cases never reported due to fears that publicity will incur retribution from the authorities. Conditional releases sometimes require prisoners not to speak about their experiences.A 2014 antiterrorism law includes lengthy prison sentences for criticizing the monarchy or the government. Among other provisions, it expanded the power of police to conduct raids targeting suspected antigovernment activity without judicial approval. The hundreds of people arrested in the 2017 anticorruption crackdown did not pass through the judicial system but were instead compelled to hand over assets to the government in return for their release. Government supporters claimed that the judicial process would have taken several years due to a lack of capacity.",1,"Allegations of torture by police and prison officials are common, and access to prisoners by independent human rights and legal organizations is extremely limited. In 2019, international media published leaked prison medical records indicating that many political prisoners suffered from cuts, bruises, burns, and malnutrition. Detained women’s rights activists were reportedly given electric shocks, whipped, beaten, sexually abused, and threatened with rape. Conditions in migrant detention centers are notoriously poor.Corporal punishment, most often flogging, is common in criminal sentencing, though the government ended its use for some crimes in 2020.Capital punishment is applied to a wide range of crimes beyond murder, including drug and protest-related offenses. Defendants facing the death penalty are known to confess under torture, but courts do not consistently investigate subsequent retractions. In March 2022, the Interior Ministry announced that 81 people had been executed on terrorism charges, marking the largest mass execution in the country’s recent history; about half of them were Shiites. In November, another 20 men were executed after being convicted of drug crimes, ending a two-year moratorium on use of the death penalty for such offenses. The European Saudi Organization for Human Rights estimated in late November that there had been a total of 147 executions to date that year.Saudi Arabia has faced cross-border military attacks from Yemen since 2015, when it entered a war against that country’s Shiite-led and Iranian-backed Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah (Supporters of God). The incidents have included drone and missile attacks on key infrastructure such as airports. The kingdom has also experienced waves of domestic terrorism from Al-Qaeda in the past.",0,"The courts engage in routine discrimination against various groups, citing their interpretations of Sharia. A woman’s testimony is generally given half the weight of a man’s testimony, and the testimony of anyone other than observant Sunni Muslims can be disregarded by judges. Shiites, who make up 10 to 15 percent of the population, face socioeconomic disadvantages, discrimination in employment, and underrepresentation in government positions and the security forces.Women are still subject to extensive legal and societal discrimination, most notably through the guardianship system, in which women must rely on a close male relative to approve many basic activities. Although legal reforms have recently reduced the scope of the guardianship system, it remains deeply entrenched in societal practices and customs, and an individual woman’s degree of freedom depends to a large extent on the attitudes of her family.Despite these enduring obstacles, education and economic rights for Saudi women have improved significantly in recent years. Reforms announced in 2019 included a ban on gender-based discrimination in employment, and job sectors that were previously reserved for men have been gradually opened to women. Women’s rate of participation in the labor force has grown rapidly in tandem with the legal changes, rising from 19 percent in 2016 to 37 percent in 2022. Same-sex sexual activity is generally understood to be prohibited under Sharia, and LGBT+ people are at risk of harassment, discrimination, criminal punishment, and violence. Saudi Arabia’s grand mufti stated in May 2022 that homosexuality is punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of $800,000. In June, authorities conducted raids on stores selling rainbow-colored products that were thought to be associated with LGBT+ identity.",1
senegal,"The judiciary is formally independent and enjoys a relatively good reputation, but the president controls appointments to the Constitutional Council, the Court of Appeal, and the Council of State. Judges are prone to pressure from the government on matters involving high-level officials. The Higher Council of the Judiciary, which recommends judicial appointments to the executive branch, is headed by the president and minister of justice, which critics argue compromises its independence. Numerous prosecutions of opposition politicians in the last several years underscore concerns about political influence. However, ahead of the 2022 local elections, the Court of Appeal reinstated candidates who had previously been disqualified.",2,"The law guarantees fair public trials and defendants’ rights, but arbitrary arrest and extended detention remain a concern. Though the government is obligated to supply attorneys to felony defendants who cannot afford them, this representation is inconsistent in practice. Lengthy pretrial detention remains a problem. The judicial system’s reach does not consistently extend to rural areas, which more often rely on traditional methods of conflict resolution.",2,"Individuals are generally protected from the illegitimate use of physical force. However, security forces have used violence against protesters, killing over a dozen and injuring hundreds in the past two years. Senegalese prisons are overcrowded, and human rights groups have documented incidents of excessive force and cruel treatment by prison authorities. In an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 through the prison system, President Sall pardoned over 2,000 prisoners—a fifth of the prison population—in April 2020.A low-level separatist conflict in the Casamance region is ongoing, though attacks by the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) have lessened since a de facto cease-fire was reached in 2012. However, fighting intensified again in 2022. The Senegalese government launched a new military offensive in March, following the January killing of four Senegalese soldiers and kidnapping of seven others by separatists. The government and one of the MFDC separatist factions signed a peace agreement in August 2022.",2,"The caste system is still prevalent among many of Senegal’s ethnic groups. Individuals of lower castes are subject to discrimination in employment. Women face persistent inequities in employment, health care, and education.Same-sex sexual activity remains criminalized and is punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine. While these laws are rarely enforced, LGBT+ people risk violence, threats, and mob attacks, as well as discrimination in housing, employment, and health care. Some are forced to flee the country for their safety; the majority of Senegalese asylum applications in France in 2021 pertained to persecution over sexual orientation. In January 2022, parliament rejected a draft law that proposed increasing prison sentences for those found guilty of same-sex sexual activity and introducing criminal penalties for those who contribute to “any activity relating to the LGBT+ agenda.” Demonstrators rallied in support of increased criminal penalties for homosexuality throughout 2021 and 2022.",2
serbia,"The independence of the judiciary is compromised by political influence over judicial appointments, and many judges have reported facing external pressure regarding their rulings. Politicians regularly comment on judicial matters, including by discussing ongoing cases or investigations with the media.",2,"Due process guarantees are upheld in some cases, but corruption, lack of capacity, and political influence often undermine these protections. Among other problems, rules on the random assignment of cases to judges and prosecutors are not consistently observed, and mechanisms for obtaining restitution in civil matters are ineffective. High-profile, politically sensitive cases are especially vulnerable to interference.",2,"The population is generally free from major threats to physical security, though some prison facilities suffer from overcrowding, abuse, and inadequate health care. Radical right-wing organizations and violent sports fans who target ethnic minorities, the LGBT+ community, and other perceived enemies also remain a concern.",3,"Legal safeguards for socially vulnerable groups are poorly enforced. For example, though women are legally entitled to equal pay for equal work, this rule is not widely respected. The Romany minority is especially disadvantaged by discrimination in employment, housing, and education. LGBT+ people continue to face hate speech, threats, and even physical violence, and perpetrators are rarely punished despite laws addressing hate crimes and discrimination. Individuals living with disabilities are among those who live in social care institutions, and have faced protracted periods of isolation as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. Disability rights groups have warned this situation violates the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which Serbia is a signatory.",2
seychelles,"Judges sometimes face interference in cases involving major commercial or political interests. Seychelles, which has few legal professionals, relies on expatriate judges who serve fixed-term contracts on the Supreme Court. The government controls the negotiations and renewal of expatriate contracts, potentially allowing officials to compromise the impartiality of the non-Seychellois magistrates. The judiciary also lacks budgetary independence from the executive and can be subject to external influence. The Supreme Court remains a target of political threats and intimidation.",2,"While constitutional rights to due process are generally respected, prolonged pretrial detention is common. The courts introduced new systems in 2016 to expedite the processing of cases, but their effect has been limited.In June 2022, the National Assembly voted in favor of a 10th amendment to the constitution, giving the Seychelles Defence Forces (SDF) the right to enforce domestic law. In effect, this amendment removes the separation between the police and the military. The country’s Ombudsman, the Seychelles Human Rights Commission (SHRC), and the Bar Association of Seychelles expressed concern that the amendment may undermine due process, the rule of law, and human rights; the groups petitioned the Constitutional Court in September for a review of the new amendment’s constitutionality. The court had not issued a ruling on the case as of year’s end.",3,"Security forces have occasionally been accused of using excessive force, and impunity for such offenses remains a problem. Police corruption continues, particularly the solicitation of bribes. Prisons remain overcrowded.",3,"Same-sex sexual activity was decriminalized in 2016, though societal discrimination against LGBT+ activists remains a problem. Prejudice against foreign workers has been reported.",3
sierra-leone,"While the constitution provides for an independent judiciary, the courts are prone to executive interference. A lack of clear procedures for appointing and dismissing judges leaves those processes vulnerable to abuse. Judicial corruption, poor salaries, and inadequate resources also undermine judicial autonomy.",2,Resource constraints and a shortage of lawyers hinder access to legal counsel. The constitutional right to a fair trial is sometimes limited in practice. Pretrial and remand prisoners are held for between three and five years before their cases are adjudicated on average. Police can hold criminal suspects for several days without charge and engage in arbitrary arrests. The death-penalty provision in the 1991 constitution was removed in 2021.,2,"Detention facilities are under strain. Prisons fail to meet basic health-and-hygiene standards, and infectious disease is prevalent. Police, who are poorly paid and minimally trained, are rarely held accountable for their actions, even when they turn to violence. Civilians can report ill-treatment to the Police Complaints, Discipline, and Internal Investigations Department or the Independent Police Complaints Board, though these agencies have very limited capacity and efficacy.Concerns over extrajudicial violence persisted in 2022. In April, the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa called on the government to release a report on the 2020 Pademba Road Prison riot, noting concerns that officers killed more inmates than was officially reported. In August, political leader Femi Claudius-Cole alleged that “death squads” were engaging in extrajudicial killings as the government imposed its August 2022 curfew.ss",3,"LGBT+ people face discrimination in employment and health-care access and are vulnerable to violence. Sex between men is criminalized under a colonial-era law.Women experience discrimination in employment, education, and access to credit. Parliament passed the Customary Land Rights Act (CLRA) in August 2022 and President Bio signed it in September; the new law is meant to improve land rights for women. The GEWEB, which was passed in November, includes provisions mandating equal pay and extending the length of paid maternity leave.",2
singapore,"The country’s top judges are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister. The government’s consistent success in court cases that have direct implications for its agenda has cast serious doubt on judicial independence. The problem is particularly evident in defamation cases and lawsuits against government opponents. While judgments against the government are rare, the judiciary is perceived to act more professionally and impartially in business-related cases, which has helped to make the country an attractive venue for investment and commerce.Defendants in criminal cases enjoy most due process rights; political interference does not occur in a large majority of cases. However, the colonial-era Internal Security Act (ISA) allows warrantless searches and arrests to preserve national security. ISA detainees can be held without charge or trial for two-year periods that can be renewed indefinitely. In recent years it has primarily been used against suspected Islamist militants. The Criminal Law Act, which is mainly used against suspected members of organized crime groups, similarly allows warrantless arrest and preventive detention for renewable one-year periods. The Misuse of Drugs Act empowers authorities to commit suspected drug users, without trial, to rehabilitation centers for up to three years.",1,"Singaporeans are largely protected against the illegitimate use of force and are not directly exposed to war or insurgencies. Prisons generally meet international standards. However, the penal code mandates corporal punishment in the form of caning, in addition to imprisonment, for about 30 offenses, and it can also be used as a disciplinary measure in prisons.Singapore authorities continues to impose the death penalty for crimes including drug trafficking; 11 people were executed during 2022. Executions had been halted in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",2,"The law forbids ethnic discrimination, though it persists in private sector or public sector employment. Women enjoy the same legal rights as men on most issues, and many are well-educated professionals, but there is no legal ban on gender-based discrimination in employment. In general, people with disabilities, LGBT+ people, and women experience more workplace discrimination than others. An August 2022 survey by gender equality group AWARE and consumer research company Milleu Insight found that one in two people in Singapore had experienced workplace discrimination; cases involving race were the most common, followed by age and gender.The LGBT+ community faces significant legal obstacles and discriminatory attitudes. In November 2022, the parliament voted to repeal a decades-old law criminalizing same-sex sexual relations. However, lawmakers also separately voted to amend the constitution to prevent any legal challenge to the current definition of marriage as between a man and a woman.The government has an official position to refuse to grant political asylum or refugee status.",2,"Citizens enjoy freedom of movement and the ability to change their place of employment. Policies aimed at fostering ethnic balance in subsidized public housing, in which most Singaporeans live, entail some restrictions on place of residence, but these do not apply to open-market housing.There are practical limits on freedom of movement for foreign migrant workers, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the government has lifted restrictions for Singaporean citizens, some movement restrictions are still selectively applied on foreign workers.",2
slovakia,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. However, there is a widespread perception of a lack of transparency and of corruption within the judicial system. In January 2022, the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) issued a compliance report concluding that that Slovak authorities had satisfactorily implemented only 2 of 21 recommendations it issued in 2019; that 3 been partly implemented, and 16 had not been implemented at all. The report also criticized the government’s slow progress in introducing measures to prevent corruption in Slovakia’s judiciary and prosecutorial systems.Recent measures intended to enhance the quality of judicial decisions and to strengthen the judiciary’s efficiency include creation of a new specialized court—the Supreme Administrative Court—in August 2021. In addition to hearing cases on matters of administrative law, the newly established court will carry out disciplinary proceedings against judges and prosecutors.",3,"Due process usually prevails in civil and criminal matters. However, there have been reports of warrantless detentions or detentions otherwise carried out without other appropriate authorization.",3,"While Slovakia is free from war, insurgencies, and high rates of violent crime, police abuse of suspects is a persistent problem. Reports of police violence against Roma emerge frequently.",3,"Roma face persistent discrimination in many forms, including from public officials and in employment. Romany children in primary schools are regularly segregated into Roma-only classes, and many are educated in schools meant to serve children with cognitive disabilities. In May 2022, a district court ruled in favor of giving financial compensation to a Romany man with special needs who was illegally detained for several weeks in 2013. Roma have been among the most visible victims of rising far right White-supremacist sentiment in Slovak society. Extremist opinions and hate speech against ethnic and religious minorities, including Roma, have grown more vitriolic in recent years.Women are underrepresented in senior-level business and government positions. A 2021 report by the Gender Equality Index, issued by the European Institute for Gender Equality, indicated that the private-sector pay gap between men and women in Slovakia has closed modestly, but remained among the worst in the European Union.Though there are antidiscrimination laws in place, discrimination against members of minority groups often goes unreported. Police do not always investigate or take action in cases of discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. A 2022 poll by Slovakia’s Institute for Public Issues (IVO) showed that almost a third of respondents had witnessed or experienced discrimination on the basis of age, typically in the labor market, in health care, and in the provision of social services.Slovakia receives very few asylum applications, and primarily functions as a transit country for asylum seekers. However, Slovak authorities apply asylum protections restrictively: just 23 of 547 applicants were granted asylum in 2022.",3
slovenia,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary. Since taking office, the GS-led coalition has declared its intention to respect the branch’s independence. In September 2022, the government proposed a constitutional amendment that would empower the president to provide final approval for many judicial appointments, though the National Assembly would retain the power to approve Constitutional Court judges.Public perception of the judiciary has improved in recent years; according to a survey conducted in 2021 and released in September 2022, 28 percent of respondents voiced distrust in the branch, an improvement over the 43 percent figure recorded in 2019. The 2022 edition of the EU Justice Scoreboard also showed that public increasingly trusts the Slovenian judiciary.Judicial efficiency has also improved, though minimal progress in addressing a backlog has been achieved. Judges usually rule in a timely manner. Those working in the judicial branch have complained about inadequate infrastructure and working conditions.",4,The rule of law is respected in civil and criminal matters. Programs aimed at reducing court backlogs have seen some success.,4,"People in Slovenia are generally free from threats of physical force. However, the national police noted an increase in murder and manslaughter in its August 2022 report, which covered the first half of the year. Prison conditions meet international standards, though overcrowding has been reported.",4,"Some deficiencies impede the protection of equal rights in Slovenia. Roma face widespread poverty, are subjected to hate speech, are socially marginalized, and lack access to early and secondary education, legal housing, and basic utilities.Though legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation exist, anti-LGBT+ discrimination remains a challenge. Ahead of the June 2022 Ljubljana pride parade, posters from an LGBT+ outreach campaign were defaced with anti-LGBT+ messages, some of which called for violence against LGBT+ people. Organizers also reported that threatening messages were shared on social media ahead of the parade.Students with disabilities have difficulty accessing educational services. In July 2022, the Advocate of the Principle of Equality reported that only a quarter of the country’s high schools were fully accessible to those with impaired mobility.In February 2022, then president Pahor offered a formal apology to the Erased, referring to 25,000 people whose residency documents were deleted by authorities in 1992; the affected people were citizens of the former Yugoslavia who had not applied for Slovenian citizenship after independence. The Slovenia Peace Institute welcomed Pahor’s apology but noted that some of the Erased have not received compensation. While the previous government restricted the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, the current administration has begun consultation on a new migration policy, which it says will address asylum practices. Some 8,200 Ukrainian refugees and 7,800 Ukrainians registered for temporary protection resided in Slovenia as of September 2022, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The UNHCR lauded Slovenia as a “welcoming environment for refugees,” but warned that the country was under strain due to the number of refugees and asylum seekers. In November, the government extended its temporary protection scheme for Ukrainians through March 2024.",3
solomon-islands,"The judiciary has a reputation for independence, though a severe lack of resources has contributed to case backlogs. Judges are appointed by the governor general on the advice of an impartial Judicial and Legal Service Commission. The Court of Appeal is mainly reliant on foreign judges.",4,Limited resources and capacity restraints are responsible for somewhat common due-process deficiencies. Half of the country’s prison inmates are on remand awaiting trial due to case backlogs.,2,"There are few major threats to physical security, though crime remains a problem in some areas. While the country has a history of internal conflict, the threat has subsided over the past two decades, thanks in large part to security aid from international partners. The police force, which was disarmed in 2003, has been entirely rebuilt with the help of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which launched that year. Mostyn Mangau became the first locally appointed police commissioner in 19 years when he took the post in 2020. In the wake of the November 2021 riots, Chinese police were deployed in March 2022 to train Solomon Islands police officers in combat skills and emergency crowd management. The unpublished security agreement reached with China in April 2022 reportedly allows for the deployment of Chinese armed police to help control disturbances in the country and protect foreign-owned capital assets.",3,"The constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, place of origin, sex, and some other categories, but the legal framework does not provide robust protections. De facto discrimination limits economic opportunities for women. Same-sex sexual activity can be punished with up to 14 years’ imprisonment. While cases are reportedly rare, the government has resisted international pressure to decriminalize such activity.Discrimination based on regional differences also remains a factor. The Guadalcanal Plains Palm Oil Ltd. (GPPOL) operation on northern Guadalcanal, one of the country’s biggest employers, avoids employing laborers from Malaita, even on a casual basis, for fear of antagonizing local communities.Ethnic Chinese residents also face discrimination. Businesses and buildings owned or operated by ethnic Chinese were targeted during the unrest following Sogavare’s appointment in 2019, while Honiara’s Chinatown was largely destroyed during the November 2021 riots.",2
somalia,"The judicial system in Somalia is fractured, understaffed, and rife with corruption. Its authority is not widely respected, with state officials ignoring court rulings and citizens often turning to Islamic or customary law as alternatives.In 2020, the cabinet approved the appointment of five members to the Judicial Service Commission, a constitutionally required body tasked with overseeing the federal courts. Political opposition and civil society groups argued that the appointments were made without proper authority or consideration of the candidates’ qualifications and independence.",0,"The country’s police, intelligence, and military services do not observe safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention, and their work is undermined by corruption.

Military courts routinely try civilians, including for terrorism-related offenses, and do not respect basic international standards for due process.",0,"The ongoing armed conflict with the Shabaab has featured numerous terrorist attacks on government, international, and civilian targets, as well as indiscriminate lethal violence and excessive force against civilians by government security services, international troops, and local militias. The Shabaab also engage in public executions of those they suspect of working with the government or international forces.Hundreds of civilians were killed by the Shabaab in 2022, whether through bombings, assassinations, or clashes between Shabaab militants and villagers. The Shabaab stepped up attacks during the elections period in 2022, assassinating at least five candidates and disrupting voting in several areas. In March, 48 people, including a legislator, were killed in an attack on the seat of government in Beledweyne, capital of the Hiran region.The AU Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) began operations in April 2022, replacing the AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), the force that had been assisting Mogadishu in its fight against the Shabaab.Tensions increased in Galmudug State in 2021 following fighting between the Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama (ASWJ) militia and state and federal security forces. Negotiations to resolve the ASWJ’s political status within the Galmudug administration continued in 2022.Government authorities carry out executions ordered by military courts after flawed proceedings. Detainees in government custody are at risk of torture, and perpetrators generally enjoy impunity.",0,"While the provisional constitution and legal system offer some formal protections against discrimination based on sex, clan, and other categories, they have little force in practice. Women face widespread disadvantages in areas including housing, education, and employment, and members of marginalized clans and some non-Somali ethnic groups suffer disproportionately from economic exclusion and violence. LGBT+ people generally do not make their identity public. Same-sex sexual activity can be punished with up to three years in prison under the penal code, and individuals accused of engaging in such activity are subject to execution in Shabaab-controlled areas.",0
south-africa,"The constitution guarantees judicial independence, and courts operate with substantial autonomy in practice. Courts have ruled against the government in several high-profile cases, including in September 2022, when the High Court ruled against the government to order that Ramaphosa’s June suspension of the public protector, who had been investigating several corruption allegations made against the president, could “reasonably be seen as retaliation” and must be lifted. However, prosecutorial independence in South Africa has been undermined in recent years, with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) experiencing a string of politically motivated appointments and ousters. In 2018, President Ramaphosa appointed a new NPA head who has worked to reform the institution. In October 2019, the NPA further bolstered its capacity when it hired several private lawyers to prosecute state capture cases.In April 2022, President Ramaphosa appointed Raymond Zondo, head of the state capture inquiry that found extensive evidence of corruption within the government and the ruling ANC, as Chief Justice of South Africa.",3,"Shortages of judicial staff and a lack of financial resources undermine defendants’ due process rights, including the right to a timely trial and state-funded legal counsel.

Official statistics released in 2022 continued to show a high rate of violent crimes in some parts of the country.In July 2021, riots and looting broke out in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, sparked by the jailing of former president Zuma. Though security forces were largely restrained in their response, more than 350 people were killed in the violence.",2,"The constitution prohibits discrimination based on a range of categories, including race, sexual orientation, and culture. State bodies such as the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and the Office of the Public Protector are empowered to investigate and prosecute discrimination cases. Affirmative-action legislation has benefited previously disadvantaged racial groups in public and private employment and in education, but racial imbalances in the workforce persist. White people, constituting a small minority, still own a majority of the country’s business assets. The Khoikhoi and Khomani San peoples suffer from social and legal discrimination.The constitution guarantees equal rights for women, which are actively promoted by the Commission on Gender Equality. Nevertheless, women are subject to wage discrimination in the workplace and are poorly represented in top management positions.Xenophobic violence against immigrants from other African countries has broken out in recent years. The government’s 2019 National Action Plan to Combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance (NAP) has largely failed to improve accountability for perpetrators of xenophobic abuse and provide justice for their victims. Political leadership on countering xenophobic violence has been lacking, and in some cases political leaders have blamed foreign nationals for their own failure to deliver on political promises. Then state security minister Ayanda Dlodlo announced in July 2021 that authorities were investigating attacks on foreign nationals during the violence in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal that month.South Africa’s asylum system is hampered by delays and administrative errors, leading to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of applications. Asylum seekers living in the country often lack official documentation that guarantees access to local services, and asylum applications are almost always rejected when they are processed.Services and accommodations for disabled people remain generally inadequate, especially in the education sector.

south-korea,"The chief justice and justices of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president with the consent of the National Assembly. Appointments are made based on recommendations from the chief justice, who is assisted by an expert advisory committee. The chief justice is also responsible for lower-court appointments, with the consent of the other Supreme Court justices. The president, National Assembly, and chief justice each nominate three members of the Constitutional Court. The judiciary is generally considered to be independent, but senior judges were ensnared in corruption scandals in recent years.",3,"Judges render verdicts in all cases. While there is no trial by jury, an advisory jury system has been in place since 2008, and judges largely respect juries’ decisions. Ordinary legal proceedings are generally considered fair, but the courts have sometimes been accused of denying due process and impartiality to defendants in NSL cases. In April and May 2022, the National Assembly passed amendments to the Prosecutors’ Office Act and the Criminal Procedure Act that would limit prosecutors’ ability to directly conduct investigations. The Justice Ministry and prosecutors petitioned the Constitutional Court in June to void the amendments, while the Yoon administration sought to expand prosecutors’ investigative powers through presidential decrees. The court did not rule by year’s end.",3,"Reports of abuse by prison guards are infrequent.

A legislative inquiry had not begun by year’s end.In December 2022, Moon Jae-in–era national security advisor Suh Hoon was arrested for allegedly mishandling the repatriation of two North Korean fishermen in 2019 and the death of a South Korean fishery official at the hands of North Korean soldiers in 2020.",3,"South Korea lacks a comprehensive antidiscrimination law. Members of the country’s small non-Korean population face legal and societal discrimination, especially in the workforce. Children of foreign-born residents and single foreign parents are systematically excluded from education and medical systems, though in 2021 the government began granting temporary stay permits and related benefits to children of undocumented migrants who were born in the country. Approximately 33,900 North Korean defectors have entered South Korea since 1998. While the government aims to socially integrate defectors, they can face months of detention and questioning upon arrival. Some defectors have reported abuse in custody and societal discrimination.North Korean defectors need not apply for asylum using the same process as other applicants. Those from other countries are far more likely to have their claims rejected or mishandled by immigration officials; the country’s refugee recognition rate has stood below one percent for several years. Afghan evacuees have reported religious discrimination and difficulty finding jobs in their respective fields. Women generally enjoy legal equality but face significant social and employment discrimination; when compared to men, they enjoy a lower employment rate and suffer a pay gap. Sexual harassment of women, including in the workplace, is common; a number of political figures have been accused as part of the #MeToo movement. Digital sex crimes against women in 2021 increased by 82 percent when compared to 2020 according to the KCSC. Neither “semen terrorism”—the act of spreading semen onto another individual or their property—nor the theft of personal objects for sexual purposes are considered sex crimes.Nearly 80 percent of stalking victims are women according to civil society. Few measures are taken to stop assailants from repeatedly approaching victims. In October 2022, Jeon Joo-hwan, a former Seoul Metro employee, was indicted for murdering a female colleague whom he had stalked. That murder led to calls for stronger antistalking punishments and greater protections for women.Same-sex relations are not restricted for the general population, but soldiers are subject to a “disgraceful conduct” provision of the Military Criminal Act (MCA) and typically face two-year prison terms for such activity. But in April 2022, the Supreme Court overturned two men’s MCA convictions; they had engaged in same-sex activity off-duty in a private residence. Existing human rights legislation bars discrimination based on sexual orientation but lacks specific penalties for violations; transgender people are not explicitly protected. In a survey released by Dawoom, an LGBT+ rights NGO, in May 2022, 66.9 percent of transgender respondents said they experienced discrimination in the previous year, 41.5 percent of all respondents considered suicide, and 8.2 percent attempted it.",3

The first trainees of a unified military force graduated in August 2022, but that force is reportedly weak compared to other security services.Infighting within the SPLM/A-IO contributed to insecurity during the year, with the leaders of two factions entering a power struggle. In July 2022, the factions’ supporters reportedly clashed in Upper Nile State, leading to 18 deaths.In July 2022, the Mayom county commissioner was killed along with several relatives. The government blamed the South Sudan People’s Movement/Army (SSPM/A), an armed group, for the killings. SSPM/A forces were also blamed for killing government troops in an ambush in Mayom that month. SSPDF forces executed four people associated with the SSPM/A in early August.The White Army, which backs an SPLM/A-IO faction led by Simon Gatwech Dual—who had once served as Machar’s military chief of staff—was also active in 2022, attacking civilians and causing displacement.

spain,"The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the courts operate autonomously in practice. However, the Council of Europe has criticized the fact that under current law, the 12 judges who sit on the 20-member General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ)—which oversees the courts and is responsible for appointing, transferring, and promoting judges—are not directly elected by their peers, but appointed through a three-fifths vote in the parliament, as with the other eight members who are not judges. This arrangement has exposed the body to political disruptions.The CGPJ’s membership was due to be renewed in late 2018, but the opposition PP denied the governing parties the necessary supermajority; the incumbent council has continued to operate on an interim basis, raising concerns about the legitimacy of its judicial appointments and other decisions. In 2022, the conservative wing of the council blocked the appointment of four new judges to replace members of the 12-seat Constitutional Court whose terms expired in June; the appointments would give the court a progressive majority. In December, when the government attempted to break the deadlock with legislation that reduced the majorities and approvals needed for judicial appointments, the Constitutional Court itself—including its outgoing members—ordered a halt to the legislative process. The unprecedented constitutional crisis ended days later, when the Constitutional Court and CGPJ agreed to move forward with the four pending appointments. However, the older impasse over renewal of the CGPJ remained unresolved. The ECHR, ruling in June 2022 on a case that dated to 2014, found that Spain had violated the privacy rights of several Catalan judges after it was proven that the police had kept files on them based on their expressed views about the legality of a possible independence referendum. The materials included photographs and personal details, and some of the information had been leaked to the press.",3,"The authorities generally observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention, though judges can authorize special restrictions on communication and delayed arraignment for detainees held in connection with acts of terrorism.

The potential for terrorist attacks by radical Islamist groups remains a concern, though Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA), a separatist group that carried out terrorist attacks for decades, formally dissolved in 2018. Prison conditions generally meet international standards, but reception centers for irregular migrants suffer from overcrowding and other problems.",4,"Women, members of racial minority groups, and LGBT+ people enjoy legal protections against discrimination and other mistreatment, though a degree of societal bias persists. A year after the July 2021 murder of a young man by a group of people who were allegedly shouting homophobic slurs, two suspects had pleaded guilty and five others were awaiting trial. Members of some minority populations—including Roma—remain economically marginalized and are allegedly subject to police profiling. Spain is a major point of entry to Europe for irregular migrants and refugees, with most making the crossing by sea; in 2022, nearly 30,000 people arrived in the country in this way. International human rights groups have criticized the response by Spanish authorities, stating that migrants and asylum seekers are often housed in poor conditions, including improvised camps that allegedly violate human rights standards. Separately, thousands of migrants and refugees regularly congregate at the land border between Morocco and the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. In 2020, the grand chamber of the ECHR upheld the legality of a controversial practice in which Spanish authorities summarily return people who cross the exclaves’ borders unlawfully, for example by scaling high fences. On June 24, 2022, nearly 2,000 people tried to cross irregularly into Spanish territory through Melilla. At least 23 migrants died and dozens more were injured in the attempt. Spanish authorities denied that any deaths—which were largely attributed to falls or the press of the crowd—occurred on Spanish soil, but investigations by media and human rights organizations detailed beatings by Moroccan police and pushbacks by security forces on the Spanish side.",3

Following the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, hundreds of Muslim suspects were arrested under the act, while Sinhalese anti-Muslim rioters were charged under standard civilian statutes that allowed bail.The government amended the PTA in March 2022 through an accelerated parliamentary process. UN human rights experts warned that the legislation’s most severe provisions remained, however. The PTA has since been used against antigovernment protesters, with three student activists being detained under the law in August. The police routinely treat government officials and those closely associated with them favorably. Military personnel accused of committing war crimes during the civil war later held prominent government roles, while others remain in senior military posts.",1,"Police and security forces have engaged in extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, custodial rape, and torture, all of which disproportionately affect Tamils. Due to backlogs and a lack of resources, independent commissions have been slow to investigate allegations of police and military misconduct. Aragalaya protesters who were arrested were reportedly tortured while in custody.",2,"Tamils report systematic discrimination in areas including government employment, university education, and access to justice. Ethnic and religious minorities are vulnerable to violence and mistreatment by security forces and Sinhalese Buddhist extremists.

LGBT+ people face societal discrimination, occasional instances of violence, and some official harassment. A rarely enforced article of the penal code prescribes up to 10 years in prison for same-sex sexual activity. Sexual harassment and employment discrimination against women are common, as are discriminatory legal provisions.

The government does not grant asylum or refugee status under its own laws, nor does it provide services or work permits to asylum seekers and refugees. These individuals rely instead on aid from NGOs, informal employment, and third-country resettlement by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.",1
st-vincent-and-grenadines,"The judiciary generally operates independently. Judges are appointed through an impartial Judicial and Legal Services Commission and cannot be dismissed arbitrarily. The country is subject to the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court and recognizes the original jurisdiction of the Caribbean Court of Justice, though the London-based Privy Council remains the final court of appeal.",4,"There is due process in civil and criminal matters. Detainees and defendants are guaranteed a range of legal rights, which are mostly respected in practice. However, there is a significant case backlog, which leads to prolonged pretrial detention.",3,"The population is free from war and other acute threats to physical security. Homicide rates remain relatively high; there were 42 recorded homicides in 2022, exceeding the 2016 record of 40. In a May interview, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves mentioned the idea of reintroducing the death penalty—which was last carried out in St. Vincent in 1995—in response to increased levels of violent crime in the country.Prison conditions have improved since a new correctional facility was opened in 2012, but the old prison in Kingstown is still in use and features substandard conditions.",4,"The constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, and other such categories, but sexual orientation and gender identity are not similarly protected. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal and carries penalties of up to 10 years in prison. While the law is rarely enforced, societal discrimination against LGBT+ people persists. In 2019, two gay Vincentian men filed a legal challenge to the law; the government said it would oppose the challenge and received the backing of several Christian groups. No further updates on the case were reported during 2022.Women reportedly face sexual harassment in the workplace, which is not specifically addressed by law.",3
sudan,"The interim constitution envisaged the establishment of an independent judiciary to replace the politically influenced judiciary of the al-Bashir era. In May 2021, the TSC removed Chief Justice Nemat Abdullah Khair and accepted the resignation of Attorney General Taj al-Ser Ali al-Hebr, who complained of a lack of independence. That month, the ERC removed more than 20 public prosecutors from office.Following the October 2021 coup, General al-Burhan replaced the acting public prosecutor and chief justice with former NCP officials. Al-Burhan’s replacement head judge, Chief Justice Abdulaziz Fath al-Rahman Abdeen, issued a directive in December ordering the reinstatement of all judges dismissed by the ERC.",0,"Although the interim constitution enshrined the right to due process, it also contained a provision allowing the government to invoke emergency powers and suspend some due process rights. In practice, security forces continued to engage in arbitrary arrests and detentions during 2022 after the October 2021 coup and related protests. Political detainees, activists, and journalists were held incommunicado without access to legal representation and were likely subject to torture and inhumane treatment.The interim constitution called for the establishment of a new public prosecutor’s office, though the public prosecutor appointed in 2019 resigned in May 2021. In August, the new public prosecutor issued Circular No. 1 (2021), a directive that outlines measures to protect witnesses, victims, and others involved in serious criminal cases. Under this directive prosecutors are advised to use pseudonyms for witnesses and victims, include psychiatrists in sensitive interviews, and provide witnesses security if necessary.",0,"In 2020, the transitional government banned forced confessions and the “infliction of torture” on suspects, prohibited the death penalty for defendants under age 18, and abolished the penalty of flogging for some criminal offenses, although flogging and other forms of corporal punishment were still prescribed for other crimes. In August 2021, it ratified the UN Convention Against Torture and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances. Court cases to hold perpetrators of state violence accountable continued or were resolved in 2021, and a few leaders of the police force responsible for allowing violence against protesters were dismissed throughout the year.However, demonstrators protesting the October coup were violently repressed and detained by security forces. Political detainees released following the November 21 agreement to restore the transitional government reported being tortured or experiencing inhumane treatment while in detention. An advisor to former prime minister Hamdok, Faisal Saleh, reported he was held in solitary confinement in a military prison.In 2019, Prime Minister Hamdok announced the creation of an independent committee to investigate the June 3 Massacre of 2019; this committee was dissolved following the coup.Despite the Juba Peace Agreement, civilians continue to be killed and tens of thousands of people were displaced by violence in several parts of the country throughout 2021. Controversies about the disposal of the bodies of victims of ethnic violence were pressing political issues, as mass graves were discovered in Central Darfur in July, following the discovery of other mass graves in Khartoum in 2020. Hundreds of decomposed bodies were found in morgues in April 2021; some believe they are the bodies of people who disappeared during the December Revolution of 2018. In response, the National Commission for Human Rights and the public prosecutor’s office both formed investigative committees.The violence in Darfur and neighboring states continued in 2022 with hundreds dying. The fighting is caused by unresolved land ownership issues but also the increasing militarization of tribal militias.",0,"The 2019 interim constitution commits the transitional government to upholding the human rights of all citizens without discrimination and ensuring their equal treatment under the law. The charter also calls for accountability for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of human rights.

Despite guarantees of equal treatment in the interim constitution and some legal improvements adopted as part of the July 2020 reforms, women continue to face disadvantages in many areas of the law, and perpetrators of widespread crimes against women—including during armed conflicts—have generally enjoyed impunity. The transitional government in April 2021 ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women but failed to endorse provisions recognizing equality in marriage, divorce, and parenting. Women are also still targeted unduly by marriage laws. In June 2022, a court sentenced a woman to death by stoning for committing adultery. (The sentence was overturned in November on procedural grounds; in December she was retried and sentenced to prison.)

Same-sex relations are illegal in Sudan, though 2020 reforms eliminated flogging and execution as potential punishments under an antisodomy law that is used to target LGBT+ people. Discrimination against LGBT+ people remains common. In 2022, the Sudanese government continued to welcome refugees; the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that the country hosted more than 1.1 million refugees as of December 2022.",0
suriname,"The judiciary has enjoyed improved autonomy since the change of government in 2020. However, judicial independence is still undermined by corruption due to a lack of resources and economic pressure. Critics, among them the NDP, claim that the judiciary is not independent.In October 2022, Lilian Ferrier, the mother of former central bank governor van Trikt, accused Judge Maytrie Kuldip Singh of presiding over a politically motivated trial against him; Ferrier also alleged that Kuldip Singh’s subsequent nomination to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights was an effective reward.",2,"Obstacles to due process include a lack of capacity and resources that contributes to corruption, trial delays, and long waits for appeals. Pretrial detention, even for minor crimes, is common and can sometimes last years.Low wages for police encourage bribery and extortion. Payments are sometimes made to obtain favorable outcomes in criminal and civil proceedings.In 2019, the Military Court convicted former president Bouterse for the abduction and murder of 15 political opponents in 1982, when he was Suriname’s military ruler. That conviction was upheld in 2021, but Bouterse appealed later that year. An appeals court began hearing the case in July 2022 and sat as recently as mid-December; a decision is expected in 2023.",2,"The population is generally free from major threats to physical security, though Surinamese are at risk of violent crime including armed robbery. The use of excessive force by law enforcement officials is prohibited although incidental police violence occurs. Temporary detention facilities are unhygienic, understaffed, and overcrowded. Suriname lies on a major drug-trafficking route, giving rise to some trafficking-related violence. Major smuggling activity is frequently uncovered by the police.Both former president Bouterse and current vice president Brunswijk have been convicted by Dutch courts in absentia of drug trafficking.",3,"The constitution prohibits race-based or ethnic discrimination. Nevertheless, Maroon and Indigenous people in the hinterland face inequality in areas such as education and employment. Residents of the interior were affected by floods in May 2022, which caused extensive damage to schools and disrupted access to education; access was also limited due to the slow flow of aid.Same-sex sexual relations are legal, though the age of consent differs from that applied to opposite-sex couples. Despite legal protections adopted in 2015, LGBT+ people face societal discrimination, harassment, and abuse by police.The constitution bars gender discrimination, but women experience disadvantages in access to employment and education in practice.",2
sweden,"The judiciary is independent under the constitution, and it enjoys relatively high support among civilians according to recent polls. Permanent judges are appointed by the government following proposals by the Judges Proposal Board. A permanent judge cannot be dismissed other than for corruption or other wrongdoing. Every district court, court of appeal, administrative court, and administrative court of appeal has lay judges. Lay judges are appointed at the local level and are formally apolitical, though they are appointed by political parties.",4,"The rule of law prevails in civil and criminal matters. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the state must provide legal counsel to people accused of criminal offenses.",4,"While Sweden is free from large-scale insurgencies, rising street violence has emerged as a growing concern. Deadly shootings, arson attacks, and explosions caused by hand grenades have taken place in many Swedish cities in recent years, mainly in poor neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. In 2022, at least 60 people were killed by gun violence, a record high. Although shootings are increasing, according to the Swedish Crime Survey, in 2021 only around 2.8 percent of the population were exposed to assault, and only 0.5 percent exposed to serious assault. The new government and in particular the Swedish Democrats are expected to promote a “tough-on-crime” approach to containing gun violence; the party has called for measures such as stripping citizenship from gang members.In July 2022, Sweden convicted an Iranian official of war crimes and sentenced him to life imprisonment for his participation in the mass execution in Iran of opposition supporters in 1988.",4,"The Swedish state works to ensure equal protection and rights for all members of the population. An equality ombudsman oversees efforts to prevent discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. However, the United Nations has called for the ombudsman’s powers to be strengthened and has noted problems with discrimination by police and correctional personnel.In recent years, multiple reports have emerged of members of the Swedish Democrats and other parties making antisemitic and anti-Muslim remarks.",4
switzerland,"While the judiciary is largely independent in practice, judges are selected based on a system of proportional party, linguistic, and regional representation in the Federal Assembly. Two Federal Supreme Court members were selected under this system in June 2021.

The Federal Council rejected the proposal in 2020, and Swiss voters rejected it in November 2021.",4,"Authorities generally observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. The constitution’s due process clause guarantees fair trial proceedings. In 2020, however, members of parliament approved legislation allowing police to preventively detain and surveil individuals suspected of terrorist activities. Swiss voters approved the legislation in June 2021. Amnesty International heavily criticized the law, warning it could be employed against children as young as 12 years old and is vague in its definition of terrorism.",4,"Switzerland is free from war and other major threats to physical security, though violent incidents do occur. Occasional instances of excessive force by police have been documented. Conditions in prisons and detention centers generally meet international standards, and the Swiss government permits visits by independent observers.",4,"Although the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or religion, anti-immigrant attitudes have grown in recent years. A 2016 immigration law included measures meant to curb mass migration from the EU and required employers to give preference to Swiss citizens in hiring practices. In 2020, voters rejected an SVP proposal to end the free movement agreement with the EU.The rights of cultural, religious, and linguistic minorities are legally protected, but minority groups—especially Roma, Sinti, and non-White people—face societal discrimination.Women generally enjoy equal rights but face pay and workplace discrimination.

Civilians may appeal military court decisions to the military chamber of the Court of Cassation, though its judges are ultimately subordinate to the military. Extremist groups have set up religious courts in their territories, imposing harsh punishments for perceived religious offenses by civilians. The general breakdown of state authority and the proliferation of militias in much of the country has led to arbitrary detentions, summary justice, and extrajudicial penalties by all sides in the civil war.",0,"An estimated 500,000 people have been killed in the civil war since 2011. While fighting has subsided somewhat since the defeat of IS in 2019 and a 2020 cease-fire in Idlib, the regime and insurgents frequently target civilians, including through indiscriminate bombardment, extrajudicial killings, and torture of detainees, with the government responsible for most abuses. The regime has been accused of repeatedly using chemical weapons on civilian targets, and its forces have detained and tortured tens of thousands of people since the war began, with many dying or disappearing in custody. In April 2022, the government announced an amnesty for people accused of terrorist crimes, but the decree’s text was vague in places, excluded crimes that led to deaths, and allowed civil cases against the accused to proceed. The amnesty effectively excluded thousands of political prisoners, including the many held without charge, and its implementation was opaque and disorderly.Ongoing fighting across northern Syria involves regime forces, the PYD-affiliated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), HTS, and the Turkish army and its allied militias. Turkish military operations have displaced tens of thousands of people and posed a serious threat to civilians living in the affected area. Infighting among Turkish-backed groups during 2022 enabled HTS advances in the northwest. Separately, in the southern governorate of Daraa, violence involving regime forces and local insurgents continued into 2022 despite a nominal regime victory in 2018 and a Russian-brokered reconciliation deal. A general deterioration of the rule of law has also reportedly contributed to violent criminality in the area.Since losing control of its last population center in 2019, IS has used guerrilla and terrorist tactics to attack security forces and local civilian leaders. In January 2022, IS attacked an SDF-defended prison in the northeast, attempting to free its detained fighters. Some 45,000 civilians were displaced in the ensuing combat, but the SDF recaptured the facility with military support from the United States and Britain. The SDF reported that about 500 IS fighters, SDF soldiers and prison staff, and civilians were killed. Residents of large detention camps for women and children who were displaced by past campaigns against IS remain at risk of violence, including murders and intimidation by extremists within the camps.",0,"Families and networks with ties to the ruling elite receive preferential treatment in legal matters, and are disproportionately Alawite, though Alawites without such connections are less likely to benefit from any special advantages. Similarly, the armed opposition is overwhelmingly Sunni Arab, and members of this population are consequently likely to face discrimination by the state unless they enjoy close ties with the regime.

The Kurdish minority population has faced decades of state discrimination, including restrictions on the Kurdish language and persecution of Kurdish activists, though conditions for Kurds have improved dramatically in areas controlled by Kurdish militias since 2011.

Women are subject to legal and societal inequities, including gender-based disadvantages in social benefits and a severe gender gap in labor force participation. Official mechanisms meant to safeguard women’s rights are reportedly not functional, and the general deterioration of law and order has left women exposed to a range of abuses, particularly at the hands of extremist groups that impose their own interpretations of religious law.

Although prosecutors and other law enforcement officials have engaged in abusive practices in the past, such violations have been less common in recent years.",4,"Both criminal violence and excessive use of force by police are rare, and attorneys are allowed to monitor interrogations to prevent torture.Capital punishment is rarely implemented in Taiwan. Three people have been put to death since 2016, and none in 2022. All of those executed were found guilty of murder or other offenses resulting in death, such as arson. Condemned inmates are hooded and sedated before being shot.",4,"The constitution provides for the equality of all citizens before the law, although Indigenous people continue to face social and economic discrimination, leading to high unemployment, lower wages, and barriers to education and social services. The 2017 Indigenous Languages Development Act designated the languages spoken by 16 officially recognized Indigenous groups as national languages and authorized their formal use in legislative and legal affairs. Despite constitutionally enshrined equal-rights protections, women face discrimination in employment and compensation. Taiwanese law prohibits discrimination in employment and education based on sexual orientation, and violence against LGBT+ people is adequately addressed by police.The National Human Rights Commission receives complaints on issues including discrimination, investigates violations, reviews laws and policies, and works with other entities to promote human rights protections.Taiwanese law does not allow for asylum or refugee status. The government has provided temporary visas and humanitarian services to people fleeing persecution in Hong Kong, but has reportedly been more restrictive in granting permanent-residency requests.",3

tanzania,"Judges are political appointees. The underfunded judiciary does not have an independent budget, making it vulnerable to political pressure. The results of such pressure have been particularly evident in cases involving opposition figures and government critics, as well as legal changes that suppress free and fair competition and protect the regime from prosecution. Politicized courts have enforced laws that attack human rights and are selectively invoked to keep the government in power. Lower-level courts are especially affected by political influence and corruption. Under a 2020 Court of Appeal ruling, the government can hold suspects without bail for several offenses including money laundering—a charge commonly levied against political opponents.In February 2022, a judge ruled that Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe and three codefendants had to stand trial on terrorism charges in what was viewed as a politically motivated case. But in March, the charges were dropped and the individuals were released.",1,"Due process guarantees are poorly upheld in civil and criminal matters. Policies and rules governing arrest and pretrial detention are often ignored, and pretrial detention commonly lasts years due to case backlogs and inadequate funding for prosecutors. Legal activists have been known to suffer repercussions for seeking justice through courts. Arbitrary and often violent arrests of opposition politicians, journalists, and civil society leaders have been commonplace. In September 2022, the LHRC called on the government to amend the Criminal Procedure Act, saying that the current code violated suspects’ rights.Security officers and militia members engaged in violence against opposition activists and civilians in Zanzibar after being deployed during the 2020 election but have not faced justice since.",1,"Reports of abuse and torture of suspects in police custody are common, and police have been accused of extrajudicial killings and other violence in recent years. In 2021, a lawyer representing Mbowe told a court that Mbowe was tortured while in custody. That same year, Chadema activist Mdude Nyangali disclosed that he was tortured.Tanzanian villages have sometimes been raided by armed groups that are active in Mozambique, which is grappling with an Islamist insurgency. In September 2022, the Tanzanian and Mozambican governments signed a security agreement to address terrorism and criminal activity on the border.",1,"Women’s rights are constitutionally guaranteed but not uniformly protected. Women face de facto discrimination in employment, including sexual harassment, which is rarely addressed through formal legal channels. Women’s socioeconomic disadvantages are more pronounced in rural areas and in the informal economy. Same-sex sexual relations are punishable by lengthy prison terms, and LGBT+ people face discrimination and police abuse, leading most to hide aspects of their identities. Men who are suspected of same-sex sexual activity have been arrested and forced to undergo anal examinations. Over 126,000 Burundian refugees resided in Tanzania as of December 2022. Burundian refugees have been forcibly repatriated and tortured with collaboration from the Tanzanian government according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). Pastoralist ethnic groups do not enjoy equal treatment, particularly when it comes to land disputes. These groups often live near lucrative national parks, and the government has engaged in heavy-handed treatment of those who refuse to comply with government directives to move. In June 2022, thousands of people were displaced after police violently tried to evict Maasai villagers in the Loliondo division of Ngorongoro, in order to clear land for a game reserve. In October, the East African Court of Justice ruled that the government’s 2017 attempt to evict Maasai from the Serengeti National Park was legal.",1
thailand,"While judicial independence is constitutionally guaranteed, courts are politicized and corrupt. The Constitutional Court has sweeping powers, including the ability to dissolve political parties, overthrow elected officials, and veto legislation. In 2018, the government enacted a law making criticism of the Constitutional Court with “rude, sarcastic, or threatening words” a criminal offense, further shielding the body from accountability. The court in 2020 abolished the FFP after what observers characterized as a highly politicized trial; in late 2021, it ruled that three activists who had called for reforms had intended to overthrow the monarchy. The court issued no explicit penalty against them but ordered protest groups to cease such activity. In September 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled that Prayuth, who declared himself prime minister after leading the 2014 coup, had not exceeded an eight-year term limit, allowing him to return to that post following a five-week suspension.",1,"Restrictions implemented by the NCPO and retained by the semicivilian government severely undermine due process rights; these include provisions allowing forms of warrantless detention.Over 1,880 individuals—283 of them minors—have faced criminal prosecution for protest-related activity between July 2020 and October 2022, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. Charges against them include sedition and lèse-majesté violations. Many were kept in pretrial detention for prolonged periods, were denied bail, or were offered bail under extremely stringent conditions.",1,"The police and military often operate with impunity, which is exacerbated by the absence of any law that explicitly prohibits torture. Legislators passed a bill in September 2022 outlawing torture and forced disappearance, which is expected to be ratified in 2023. Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists characterized the bill as a significant step, but stated that it nevertheless failed to fully meet human rights obligations under rights treaties to which Thailand is a signatory and lacks effective enforcement measures.While most of Thailand is free from terrorism or insurgency, a combination of martial law and emergency rule has been in effect for over a decade in the four southernmost provinces, where Malay Muslims form a majority and a separatist insurgency has been ongoing since the 1940s. Civilians are regularly targeted in shootings, bombings, and arson attacks, and insurgents have focused on schools and teachers as symbols of the Thai state. Thousands of suspected militants and sympathizers have been indiscriminately detained in counterinsurgency operations. Long-standing and credible reports of human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, by government forces and insurgents also exist. Following the 2019 elections, physical attacks on prodemocracy activists by masked assailants widely assumed to have government ties increased, with the authorities conducting no credible investigations. Authorities continued to use excessive force to disperse antigovernment protesters in 2022.Extraterritorial executions and disappearances of Thai dissidents-in-exile have taken place in recent years. In June 2020, Wanchalerm Satsaksit, an exiled Thai activist living in Cambodia, was disappeared from Phnom Penh, presumably by agents of the Thai state; he remains missing.",1,"In Thailand’s north, so-called hill tribes are not fully integrated into society. Many individuals lack formal citizenship, which renders them ineligible to vote, own land, attend state schools, or receive protection under labor laws. Thailand is known for its tolerance of LGBT+ people, though societal acceptance is higher for tourists and expatriates than for nationals, and unequal treatment and stigmatization remain challenges. Women face discrimination in employment, a problem that was highlighted the Royal Police Cadet Academy’s 2018 decision to ban female cadets.Thailand has not ratified the UN convention on refugees, who risk detention as unauthorized migrants and often lack access to asylum procedures.

His conviction was upheld in July 2022.",2,"Due process rights are often restricted or denied, owing in part to a dearth of resources and personnel leading to case backlogs. Use of Portuguese for court administration poses an obstacle, and shortages of interpreters have sometimes forced adjournment of trials. Cases involving past human rights abuses require a panel including two international judges. The 2014 dismissals of international judges interrupted these cases and no new cases have been brought since.Alternative methods of dispute resolution and customary law are widely used, though they lack enforcement mechanisms and have other shortcomings, including gender discrimination. Many municipalities have no fixed courts and rely on mobile services established as an interim measure. Plans for a hybrid justice system, with more harmonization between formal and customary dispute resolution mechanisms, have been announced.",1,"Police officers and soldiers are regularly accused of excessive force and abuse of power, though the courts have had some success in prosecuting offenders. Public perception of the police has improved in recent years, as have general feelings of security.",3,"While hate crimes based on sexual orientation are considered an aggravating circumstance in the penal code, other protections against discrimination for LGBT+ people are lacking. Gay men and transgender women have trouble accessing employment opportunities due to low rates of access to education and discrimination. Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals report cases of extreme physical violence from strangers and relatives, including cases of “corrective” rape and forced marriage. Equal rights for women are constitutionally guaranteed, but discrimination and gender inequality persist in practice and in customary law.Religious minorities have reported difficulties in authorities’ acceptance of marriage and birth certificates issued by religious entities.

Islamist militants present a growing security threat in Togo, particularly in the north. In May 2022, eight soldiers were killed near the border with Burkina Faso by an organization affiliated with al-Qaeda. Assailants killed at least 25 people when they attacked northern villages in July. Also in July, the army disclosed that an aircraft targeting militant fighters attacked civilians in error; local media reported that seven children died in that incident.

The May 2021 murder of an LGBT+ rights activist prompted renewed calls for a repeal of the law; the man suspected of committing the murder pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.",3
trinidad-and-tobago,The judicial branch is generally independent but is subject to some political pressure and corruption.,3,"Due process rights are constitutionally provided for but are not always upheld. Rising crime rates and institutional weakness have produced a severe backlog in the court system. Corruption in the police force, which is often linked to the illegal drugs trade, is endemic, and inefficiencies have resulted in the dismissal of some criminal cases. Intimidation of witnesses and jurors has been reported by judicial officials.",2,"The government has struggled to address criminal violence, which is mostly linked to organized crime and drug trafficking. The US State Department issued a travel advisory for Port of Spain, Trinidad’s capital, in October 2022, due to the high rates of violent crime in the city. Parliament passed a law meant to combat criminal gang activity in 2021, but its impact has been limited. In August 2022, the Trinidadian government called the illegal flow of arms and ammunition into the country the greatest threat to its national security.The country recorded 601 murders in 2022—an all-time record. The 2021 figure was 448. Police have been criticized for excessive use of force. According to a Police Complaints Authority (PCA) report submitted to Parliament in November 2022, between October 2020 and September 2021, 115 police officers were implicated in murders, fatal shootings, and nonfatal shootings.In May 2022, the London-based Privy Council, Trinidad and Tobago’s final court of appeal, ruled that the country’s mandatory imposition of the death penalty on those convicted of murder was constitutional, further saying that according to the constitution, only Parliament can amend the law. No executions were carried out during 2022.Trinidadians have reportedly sought to join the Islamic State (IS) militant group in recent years.",2,"Despite legal protections against discrimination on various grounds, racial disparities persist, with Indo-Trinidadians accounting for a disproportionate share of the country’s economic elite. Women continue to face discrimination in employment and compensation.Human rights groups have criticized the government’s unwillingness to address discrimination and violence against LGBT+ people. However, in 2018, the High Court ruled that the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act that criminalized same-sex relations were unconstitutional. The government vowed to appeal that ruling to the Privy Council; the case remains pending.Immigration law does not adequately protect refugees, and Trinidad specifically lacks a system to process asylum claims. As many as 40,000 Venezuelan asylum seekers and refugees have entered the country in recent years, but authorities regularly seek to detain and deport these individuals as illegal immigrants. Local courts have intervened to block deportations. Officials have espoused derogatory rhetoric when discussing refugees. There are regular reports of Venezuelans drowning en route to Trinidad and Tobago.Trinidadians were among those held by Kurdish forces in the al-Hol camp in Syria after IS lost its territorial holdings there in 2019. Some 24 women and 74 children reportedly remain in Syrian camps as of August 2022. Efforts to repatriate those in the camps back to Trinidad are ongoing.",2
tunisia,"Between the 2011 revolution and President Saïed’s seizure of extraordinary powers in 2021, elected officials took steps to institutionalize an independent judiciary. Legislation adopted in 2016 established the High Judicial Council (HJC), a body tasked with ensuring the independence of the judiciary and appointing a third of the Constitutional Court judges. Council members were elected that year by thousands of legal professionals. However, governments and lawmakers repeatedly failed to establish the Constitutional Court as envisioned by the 2014 constitution; its role would have been to evaluate the constitutionality of decrees and laws. The absence of such a court became especially problematic in 2021, as there was no authoritative mechanism for assessing the constitutionality of Saïed’s emergency measures.In February 2022, Saïed followed through on his promises to dissolve the professionally elected HJC and issued a decree creating a new, appointed body to replace it. In June, he issued a decree allowing the president to unilaterally dismiss judges, then immediately fired 57 judges on grounds of alleged corruption. Unions representing Tunisian judges initiated a four-week strike against these measures. An administrative court ordered the reinstatement of 49 of the dismissed magistrates in August, citing a lack of due process, but the government had yet to comply with the order at year’s end.While the new constitution preserved both an HJC and a Constitutional Court in name, it granted the president final authority over judicial appointments following nominations by the HJC, whereas the 2014 charter had made the HJC’s appointment recommendations binding on the executive. In addition, the new constitution removed a clause of the 2014 constitution that granted the Constitutional Court authority to rule on the extent of the president’s powers.",1,"Though civil and criminal procedures have improved significantly since the time of Ben Ali, a state of emergency in place since 2015 and renewed repeatedly has given police broad license to arrest and detain people on security- or terrorism-related charges, and arbitrary arrests continued to take place during 2022. Civilians are still tried in military courts, particularly on charges of defaming the army. Those targeted for military trials have included lawmakers, businessmen, journalists, and bloggers.In 2014, Tunisia established a Truth and Dignity Commission (IVD) to examine political, economic, and social crimes committed since 1956, and it soon began collecting testimony. In early 2018, the parliament voted against extending the commission’s mandate, a decision that drew criticism from rights activists for weakening transitional justice efforts. The commission presented its final report in 2019 and officially published it in 2020, drawing on over 62,000 complaints filed by Tunisian citizens against the state for human rights abuses. Tunisian courts began reviewing 69 indictments and 131 referrals from the IVD, but the president’s emergency measures in 2021 created uncertainty about the future of the transitional justice process.",2,"Physical security has been threatened by periodic terrorist attacks in recent years, including some claimed by the Islamic State (IS) militant group.The police force is the subject of long-standing brutality complaints, with officers accused of abusing civilians and detainees with impunity. Police unions have resisted reform efforts aimed at addressing the problem.While some offenses can still draw the death penalty under Tunisian law, the authorities have not carried out an execution since 1991.",3,"Although the constitution guarantees gender equality, women experience discrimination in employment, and sexual harassment in public spaces remains prevalent. Black Tunisians face chronic disparities on indicators including employment and education; societal bias remains a widespread problem, though a 2018 law criminalized racial discrimination.LGBT+ people continue to face legal discrimination. Same-sex sexual activity remains illegal, with the penal code calling for prison sentences of up to three years for “sodomy.” This law has been enforced in practice in recent years.Tunisia has no asylum law, leaving the United Nations as the sole entity processing claims of refugee status in the country. Irregular migrants and asylum seekers are often housed in informal detention centers, where they suffer from substandard living conditions. Delays in the issuance of residency permits make it impossible for many to work legally, forcing them to take informal jobs with no labor protections.",2
turkey,"Judicial independence has been severely compromised, as thousands of judges and prosecutors have been replaced with government loyalists since 2016. Under the presidential system that took effect in 2018, members of Turkey’s Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSK), which oversees judicial appointments and disciplinary measures, are appointed by the parliament and the president rather than by members of the judiciary. As a result, prosecutors and judges often toe the government line. Judges who rule against the government’s wishes have been removed and replaced, while those who convict Erdoğan’s critics have been promoted.Politically motivated prosecutions target politicians, journalists, academics, and students. In May 2022, the Court of Cassation upheld three sentences against the CHP’s Istanbul chair, Canan Kaftancioğlu, for “insulting a public official,” “insulting the president,” and “degrading the state.” The Constitutional Court has shown some independence since 2019 but is not free from political influence and often delivers rulings in line with AKP interests.",1,"Severe violations of due process in the judicial system persist. Defendants are often held in lengthy pretrial detention that can last up to seven years. Prosecutors often wait months before unveiling charges and produce lengthy accounts that often lack evidence. In many cases, lawyers defending people accused of terrorism face arrest themselves. Lower courts often defy rulings by higher courts that they are legally bound to implement.The case against Turkish philanthropist Osman Kavala has been riddled with due process violations. Accused of attempting to overthrow the government in 2017, Kavala was held in pretrial detention for more than a year before he saw his indictment. He has endured two trials since 2019, wherein judges who ordered his release were replaced between hearings without explanation, alongside other procedural anomalies. After he was exonerated in 2020, Kavala was immediately rearrested under different charges. In April 2022, judges in the second trial sentenced him to life in prison. The ECHR in July published a ruling that Turkey had violated its previous, 2019 ruling calling for Kavala’s release.",0,"Turkish authorities are regularly accused of torturing prisoners. Prosecutors do not consistently investigate allegations of torture or abuse in custody, and the government has resisted the publication of a European Committee for the Prevention of Torture report on its detention practices.While the threat of terrorism has decreased since 2018, a bomb attack in Istanbul in November 2022, which the government blamed on the outlawed PKK, killed six people and injured more than 80. Turkey remains at war with the PKK and civilians in the country’s Kurdish-majority southeast continue to grapple with effects of the conflict.",1,"Although Turkey’s laws guarantee equal treatment of all citizens, religious, ethnic, and sexual and gender minorities suffer varying degrees of discrimination. Alevis and non-Muslims face systemic discrimination in schools and the public sector. The government’s war with the PKK is used to justify discriminatory measures against Kurdish citizens, including the prohibition of Kurdish festivals. Kurdish schools and cultural organizations, many of which had opened while peace talks were taking place, have been investigated or shut down since 2015.Although women make up a growing part of the workforce, gender inequality is a pressing issue. While same-sex relations are not legally prohibited, LGBT+ people face widespread discrimination, police harassment, and violence. Laws do not protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and LGBT+ people are banned from serving in the military. Top state officials frequently engage in homophobic hate speech; President Erdoğan in 2020 defended Turkey’s head of religious affairs after he linked homosexuality to disease and societal decay. The government continues to censor LGBT+ content in the media, including on Netflix.Turkey hosts more than 4 million refugees and migrants, most of them from Syria, according to the government. Refugees have no clear path to citizenship and their movement is restricted to their provinces of registration, outside of which they not allowed to live or work. Most refugee children lack access to education, and most adults lack employment permits. Popular resentment against refugees and discriminatory rhetoric against refugees among politicians has been increasing, and in 2022 and many refugee homes and businesses faced violent mob attacks. Amid this political atmosphere, residency permits for refugees and migrants have become increasingly difficult to obtain and to renew. Reports also point to a growing number of deportations. Nearly 60,000 Syrian refugees relocated from Turkey to Turkish-controlled zones in Syria in 2022. While the Turkish government calls these returns “voluntary,” international NGOs have disputed the nature of the relocations, calling them forced deportations. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), Turkish authorities arbitrarily arrested and deported hundreds of male Syrian refugees in 2022.",1

tuvalu,"The judiciary is independent. The head of state appoints the chief justice on the advice of the cabinet, and other judges are appointed in the same manner after consultation with the chief justice. Judges cannot be removed arbitrarily.A constitutional amendment proposed in December 2022 would introduce specific qualifications for holding judicial posts and would remove a provision requiring High Court judges to have served in countries with similar legal systems. That rule has effectively kept Tuvaluans from serving on the High Court. Another proposed amendment would allow for the creation of a public prosecutor’s office; that office would fulfill some of the attorney general’s current duties.",4,"The authorities generally uphold due process during arrests, detentions, and trials. A public defense lawyer is available to detainees and defendants.

Same-sex sexual activity is illegal and can be punished with imprisonment, though the law is not actively enforced. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not specifically banned.

The committee did propose amendments to address discrimination on the basis of disability, however.There is no national legal framework for providing refuge to asylum seekers.",3
uganda,"The Ugandan judiciary suffers from lack of investment, executive influence, and systemic corruption, which weaken judicial independence. Many critics see the judiciary as a political tool for the NRM, particularly as it consistently rules in line with President Museveni’s interests. High Court justices are selected by the president after recommendation from the Judicial Services Commission; the members of the Judicial Service Commission are themselves appointed by the president with approval from Parliament.Critics argued that a 2022 proposal to expand the Supreme Court from 11 to 21 judges would further politicize the court in favor of the NRM. Others claim it reflects a continued expansion of a political patronage system, since the president’s cabinet cannot be further expanded, and Parliament has already been expanded significantly.",1,"Police routinely engage in arbitrary arrests and detentions, despite legal safeguards against such practices. Due process is also affected by prolonged pretrial detention, inadequate access to counsel for defendants, and corruption. A number of reform initiatives in recent years, including the introduction of plea bargaining in 2015, have reportedly had some success in reducing case backlogs. Police are known to rearrest suspects who have been released from detention.",1,"The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a militant group that sought to overthrow the government, was active from the 1980s until its forced withdrawal from Ugandan territory in the mid-2000s. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) still operate in the western region on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and were linked to bombings in Kampala in October and November 2021. Throughout 2021, the Ugandan and Congolese militaries joined efforts to fight the ADF in the DRC and have reported that their efforts have been largely successful. The Karamoja region has also seen ongoing insecurity mainly caused by cattle raiding; by September 2022, the Ugandan government had built seven new police posts in an effort to quell the violence. State violence remains a real threat for many, especially those active in political opposition; gender-based violence is also prevalent.Rape, extrajudicial violence, and torture and abuse of suspects and detainees by security forces are persistent problems, and perpetrators are rarely prosecuted. Prison conditions are poor. The prison system operates at triple its intended capacity, with pretrial detainees constituting nearly half of the inmate population as of August 2022, according to the World Prison Brief database.",1,"Ugandan laws prohibit discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, age, race, disability, color, and sex. However, LGBT+ people face overt hostility from the government and society. Same-sex relations are criminalized under a colonial-era law, and people accused of same-sex relations are at significant risk of being tortured and killed. Numerous parliamentary and presidential attempts to pass new and even harsher legislation against LGBT+ people have made it a common talking point in the media.While employment discrimination based on gender and other criteria is legally prohibited, in practice it is poorly enforced and does not apply to the vast informal sector.There were nearly 1.5 million refugees living in Uganda as of mid-2022, and the United Nations has praised the government for its progressive asylum policies.

ukraine,"Ukraine has long suffered from corrupt and politicized courts, and reform initiatives meant to address the issue have stalled or fallen short of expectations. Zelenskyy unsuccessfully attempted to dissolve the Constitutional Court in 2020 after it annulled anticorruption laws, and to suspend judges under corruption investigations. In 2021, Zelenskyy tried to appoint two new judges to the Constitutional Court, which declined to swear them in. In June 2022, the European Council granted Ukraine the status of candidate for EU membership. One of the key conditions for maintaining this status is the successful implementation of reforms to the Constitutional Court, particularly a more transparent, merit-based process for the selection of judges. In September, the parliament advanced a draft law in its first reading on the establishment of an advisory group of experts to vet candidates for the Constitutional Court. While the group would include both Ukrainian and international experts, it would exclude representatives of Ukrainian civil society.",1,"Although due process guarantees exist, in practice individuals with financial resources and political influence can escape prosecution for wrongdoing. According to the World Prison Brief, 36 percent of prisoners were in pretrial detention as of October 2021. Judges have stymied corruption investigations into high-profile officials, including within the judiciary.",1,"After the Ukrainian army forced Russian troops to retreat from the Kyiv Region in early April 2022, most fighting was concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine. However, beginning in February, all regions of Ukraine were subjected to indiscriminate Russian missile and artillery strikes against both civilian and military targets. It was estimated that more than 15 percent of Ukrainian territory (including Crimea) was under Russian occupation at year’s end. Invading Russian troops have engaged in a range of human rights violations affecting both civilians and combatants, including arbitrary detention and forced disappearance, torture, conflict-related sexual violence, and other apparent war crimes. Evidence that Russian forces carried out a massacre of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha emerged in April. Estimates of the number of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians killed during the year varied widely. One figure, from the British Broadcasting Corporation, put the number of civilian deaths at 3,600 in June; by year’s end the number was likely much higher.At the onset of the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s parliament adopted an emergency measure allowing civilians to receive firearms to defend against Russian aggression. Thousands of firearms were distributed among civilians in the Kyiv Region who joined Territorial Defense Forces to repel the Russian offensive against the capital. Given the urgency of the situation, many of the firearms were not properly registered, meaning the government does not have an accurate account of all weapons held by civilians. At year’s end the parliament was still considering a new law that would streamline the registration of firearms. The trafficking of weapons and ammunition from the front line had contributed to the proliferation of arms throughout Ukraine since 2014.In response to Ukrainian forces’ successful counteroffensives in the south and northeast, Russian forces intensified long-distance strikes on civilian infrastructure across the country in the last months of the year, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heating, water, or adequate housing.",0,"A 2012 law introduced a nonexclusive list of grounds on which discrimination is prohibited. Gender discrimination is explicitly banned under the constitution. However, these protections are inconsistently enforced. The Romany minority and LGBT+ people experience significant discrimination in practice. Roma and LGBT+ people and groups generally only receive police protection or justice for attacks against them when there is intense pressure from civil society or international observers. Rights groups have reported that employers openly discriminate on the basis of gender and age.

united-arab-emirates,"The judiciary is not independent, with court rulings subject to review by the political leadership. Judges are appointed by executive decree, and the judiciary as an institution is managed largely by executive officials. Many judges are foreigners working on short-term contracts.",0,"Detainees are often denied adequate access to legal counsel during interrogations, and lengthy detention without charge is not uncommon. Judges are empowered to extend such detention indefinitely. Systematic violations of international due process standards have been observed in numerous high-profile trials involving political dissidents, human rights defenders, and foreigners, among others. Some of those convicted have their detentions arbitrarily extended after their sentences are complete. For example, many of the individuals who were arrested in 2012 and convicted in 2013 as part of a deeply flawed mass trial of 94 dissidents—known as the UAE 94—were kept in detention during 2022 despite the expiration of their prison terms.",1,"The government has been criticized by international human rights organizations for failure to investigate allegations of torture and mistreatment in custody, including denial of medical care. Detainees regularly report abuse by the authorities. Prison officials have allegedly imposed harsher conditions of confinement on Ahmed Mansoor since he protested or denounced his mistreatment in previous years.Sharia (Islamic law) courts sometimes impose flogging sentences for offenses including drug use, prostitution, and extramarital sex.",1,"Noncitizens and foreign workers commonly experience discrimination and risk deportation for relatively minor offenses. Women face legal and societal discrimination on a variety of issues, including employment. Same-sex sexual relations can draw harsh criminal penalties under vaguely worded morality laws, and these provisions were retained in the new penal code that took effect in January 2022. LGBT+ people are also subject to widespread social stigma. A code of conduct for teachers that was issued ahead of the new school year in September 2022 directed educators to “refrain from discussing gender identity, homosexuality or any other behavior deemed unacceptable to UAE’s society.”",1
united-states,"The American judiciary is largely independent. The courts regularly demonstrate their autonomy by blocking or limiting executive and legislative actions, and this continued during 2022.However, the pattern of judicial appointments in recent years has added to existing concerns about partisan distortion of the appointment and confirmation process. Norm-breaking procedural maneuvering allowed Republicans to hold open an unusually large number of judicial vacancies under President Obama and then fill them under President Trump, including a Supreme Court vacancy that began during Obama’s final year in office. Trump filled two additional vacancies on the Supreme Court in 2018 and 2020 after deeply contentious Senate hearings and nearly party-line votes. These appointments cemented a conservative Supreme Court majority.Biden sought to return to a more traditional use of presidential clemency powers in 2022, focusing largely on commuting the sentences of people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. President Trump had repeatedly used his pardon authority in an arbitrary or politicized fashion, bypassing Justice Department processes and awarding pardons to many of his own personal associates or individuals whose cases were championed by his political allies.In many states, judges are chosen through either partisan or nonpartisan elections, and a rise in campaign fundraising and party involvement in such elections over the last two decades has increased the threat of bias and favoritism in state courts. In addition, executive and legislative officials in a growing number of states have attempted to exert greater control over state courts in recent years.",3,"The United States has a deeply rooted rule-of-law tradition, and legal and constitutional protections for due process are widely observed. However, the criminal justice system suffers from a number of chronic weaknesses, many of which are tied to racial discrimination and contribute to disparities in outcomes that disadvantage people of color, particularly Black Americans. Media reports and analyses in recent years have drawn new attention to the extensive use of plea bargaining in criminal cases, with prosecutors employing the threat of harsh sentences to avoid trial and effectively reducing the role of the judiciary and juries; deficiencies in the parole system; long-standing funding shortages for public defenders, who represent low-income defendants in criminal cases; racial bias in risk-assessment tools for decisions on pretrial detention; and the practice of imposing court fees or fines for minor offenses as a means of raising local budget revenues, which can lead to jail terms for those who are unable to pay.These problems and evolving enforcement and sentencing policies have contributed to major increases in incarceration over time. The population of sentenced state and federal prisoners soared from about 200,000 in 1970 to more than 1.6 million in 2009, then gradually decreased to roughly 1.2 million as of the end of 2021, according to the most recent data available. The incarceration rate based on such counts rose from around 100 per 100,000 US residents in 1970 to a peak of more than 500 in the late 2000s, then fell to about 350 as of the end of 2021. There are also hundreds of thousands of pretrial detainees and short-term jail inmates behind bars. Despite gradual declines in the number of Black prisoners, Black and Hispanic inmates continue to account for a majority of the prison population, whereas Black and Hispanic people account for roughly a third of the general US population. Lawmakers, elected state attorneys, researchers, activists, and criminal justice professionals have reached a broad consensus that the current level of incarceration is not needed to preserve public safety. In recent years, Congress and the executive branch have enacted modest reforms to address mass incarceration and racial disparities in sentencing, such as a 2018 law that eased federal mandatory-minimum sentencing rules and a 2022 Justice Department policy that would reduce sentencing gaps between similar drug offenses. A majority of states have also passed laws in recent years to reduce sentences for certain crimes, decriminalize minor drug offenses, and combat recidivism. However, such gradual steps slowed amid fears of rising crime in 2022. Some states have restricted the use of cash bail, which can unfairly penalize defendants with fewer resources and enlarge pretrial jail populations.",3,"Both the US homicide rate—at 6.9 per 100,000 inhabitants as of 2021, according to FBI data—and overall crime rates have declined substantially since the 1990s. However, the figures are high when compared with other wealthy democracies, and the homicide rate rose by 30 percent between 2019 and 2020, with even higher spikes in a number of large cities. The number of murders continued to rise nationally at a slower pace in 2021, then appeared to decline slightly in 2022.The increased policy focus on reforming the criminal justice system in recent years has coincided with a series of widely publicized incidents in which police actions led to civilian deaths. Most of these prominent cases involved Black civilians, while Native Americans are reportedly killed by police at a higher rate per capita than any other group. Only a small fraction of police killings lead to criminal charges; when officers have been brought to trial, the cases have often ended in acquittals or sentences on reduced charges. In many instances, long-standing and rigid labor protections prevent municipal governments and police departments from imposing significant administrative sanctions on allegedly abusive officers. Nevertheless, some officers have received substantial prison sentences in recent years, including for the 2020 murder of George Floyd. That year’s protests against police violence and racial injustice succeeded in drawing media and advocacy attention to many police departments’ deep resistance to any reform or accountability mechanisms. A push by some reform advocates to cut police departments’ funding and direct it to other public services faced criticism amid rising crime rates, however, and many such efforts were subsequently diluted or reversed.Conditions in prisons, jails, and pretrial detention centers are often poor at the state and local levels, and death rates in jails appear to have risen in recent years, driven not only by the COVID-19 pandemic but also by increased suicides and drug overdoses, with negligence or understaffing among corrections officers a contributing factor in some deaths. Use of the death penalty has declined over time. There were 18 executions carried out by six states in 2022—up from 11 executions in 2021, but significantly down from a peak of 98 in 1999. The death penalty has been formally abolished by 23 states; in another 16 states where it remains on the books, executions have not been carried out for the past five years or more. In 2020 the federal government resumed executions for the first time since 2003, and 13 federal executions were carried out before the Biden administration imposed a moratorium in 2021. Factors encouraging the decline of the death penalty include clear racial disparities in its application; a pattern of exonerations of death-row inmates, often based on new DNA testing; states’ inability to obtain chemicals used in lethal injections due to objections from producers; multiple cases of botched executions; and the high costs to state and federal authorities associated with death penalty cases. The US Supreme Court has effectively ruled out the death penalty for crimes other than murder and in cases where the perpetrator is a juvenile or mentally disabled, among other restrictions.",3,"An array of policies and programs are designed to protect the rights of individuals against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, and other categories, including in the workplace. However, women and some minority groups continue to suffer from disparities on various indicators, and a number of recent government policies have infringed on the fundamental rights of asylum seekers and immigrants.Although women constitute almost half of the US workforce and have increased their representation in many professions, the average compensation for female workers is roughly 83 percent of that for male workers, a gap that has remained relatively constant over the past several decades. Meanwhile, the wage gap between White and Black workers has grown in recent decades, meaning Black women, who are affected by both the gender and racial components of wage inequality, made about 69 cents for every dollar earned by White male workers as of 2020, according to the most recent data available. Women are also most often affected by sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. A popular and ongoing social media campaign that began in late 2017, the #MeToo movement, has encouraged victims to speak out about their experiences, leading to accountability for some perpetrators and underscoring the scale of the problem in American society.In addition to structural inequalities and discrimination in wages and employment, racial and ethnic minority groups face long-running and interrelated disparities in education and housing. De facto school segregation is a persistent problem, and the housing patterns that contribute to it are influenced by factors such as mortgage discrimination, which particularly affects Black and Hispanic homeowners. Black homeownership has fallen steadily from a peak in 2004, despite gains for other groups in recent years. This in turn influences overall gaps in wealth and social mobility. For example, the median wealth of White families is 12 times the median wealth of Black families. Black people also face discrimination in health care and experience worse outcomes than their White counterparts; during the COVID-19 pandemic, people of color experienced strikingly higher mortality from the virus. Violence motivated by racism or other forms of group animosity is a regular occurrence in the United States. Asian Americans were the victims of a surge in discrimination and hate crimes in 2020 and 2021, attributed in part to President Trump’s attempts to focus blame for the pandemic on China, where the initial outbreak occurred. A White gunman’s racist killing of 10 Black people in a Buffalo, New York, supermarket in May 2022 illustrated the continuing threat from violent White supremacism, while the November murder of five people in a Colorado nightclub that was popular with LGBT+ people reflected the persistence of hate crimes based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In general, LGBT+ people have made strides toward legal equality in recent years. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that federal civil rights legislation includes LGBT+ people as a class protected from workplace discrimination. In 2021, the Biden administration lifted a Trump-era ban on transgender people serving in the military, and the administration has taken other steps to affirm the rights of transgender people. However, significant discrimination endures. In March 2022, Florida lawmakers adopted a bill that banned discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in most primary-school classrooms, prompting multiple lawsuits attempting to block enforcement; similar bills were introduced in at least a dozen additional states during the year. A number of other new state laws have restricted the rights of transgender people in particular.Throughout 2022, the Biden administration continued to use a COVID-19-related public health authority known as Title 42 to rapidly expel or deport hundreds of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers. However, a growing proportion of migrants and asylum seekers came from countries that were exempt from Title 42. Some Republican state governors took unilateral steps to draw attention to the administration’s alleged failure to protect the border. Starting in April, Texas officials conducted trade-disrupting inspections of vehicles crossing from Mexico and arranged for the busing of thousands of newly arrived migrants to New York, Washington, DC, and other cities governed by Democrats. In September, Florida governor Ron DeSantis oversaw the air transport of nearly 50 migrants from Texas to a wealthy island in the state of Massachusetts; the move triggered multiple investigations into whether the migrants in question had been illegally deceived or federal funds had been misused to finance the operation. Since 2021, immigration authorities have moved away from maximizing arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants and back toward the Obama-era policy of focusing deportation efforts on those individuals who pose the greatest threat to public safety. Nevertheless, the backlog of cases in immigration courts continued to balloon; as of the end of 2022 there were over two million pending cases, with average wait times of more than two years for a case to be resolved—though the cases of those held in immigration detention tend to move more quickly. Human rights and immigrant advocacy groups criticized the government for taking inadequate measures to address poor conditions in immigration detention facilities. In August 2022, the Biden administration announced steps intended to strengthen the legal standing of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which prevents the deportation of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. However, in October a federal appeals court ruled that the program was illegal, leaving it in limbo as appeals continued at year’s end.",2
united-kingdom,"The judiciary is generally independent, and authorities comply with judicial decisions. A new Supreme Court began functioning in 2009, improving the separation of powers by moving the highest court out of the House of Lords.In a June 2022 report, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Democracy and the Constitution warned that political pressure on the judiciary affected morale within the branch; the group also concluded that the Supreme Court may have “assumed a position more palatable to the executive” in some decisions.",4,"Due process generally prevails in civil and criminal matters. However, cuts to legal aid have left many vulnerable people without access to legal counsel.UK police have been accused of using stop-and-search powers disproportionately: In 2021–22, Black people in England and Wales were over six times more likely to be searched by police than White people. In an April 2022 report, the Independent Office for Police Conduct recommended that BAME individuals receive safeguards from stops and searches on the grounds of racial bias. In May, the government lifted a restriction on stops and searches in areas where authorities expect serious violence. In August, the children’s commissioner in England criticized the Metropolitan Police, which patrols Greater London, for strip-searching 650 children between 2018 and 2020, 58 percent of them Black. Under the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, authorities can seize the travel documents of individuals attempting to leave the country if they are suspected of planning to engage in terrorist-related activities abroad, and to forcibly relocate terrorism suspects within the country. The Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019 makes viewing terrorist content online punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and allows law enforcement agencies to keep the fingerprints and DNA of terrorism suspects for up to five years, even if no charges are filed. The UK justice system still grapples with cases stemming from the Troubles, the 1968–98 conflict in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, which was under upper-house consideration at the end of 2022, would offer “conditional” immunity for those who cooperate with “truth recovery investigations;” Amnesty International criticized the bill, saying it would not provide justice for victims of the conflict. A May report from the Committee on the Administration of Justice and the Queen’s University Belfast School of Law said the bill may breach the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and international human rights law.In 2021, charges against “Soldier F,” who had been accused of murder and attempted murder during the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre, were dismissed by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). The High Court overturned that decision in March 2022; the PPS will conduct a new investigation.",3,"Individuals living in the UK are largely free from violence, but acts of terrorism have occurred in recent years. In October 2022, an immigration processing center in Dover was attacked by a man allegedly driven by far-right views. Paramilitary activity continues in Northern Ireland. In September 2022, the Police Service of Northern Ireland reported one security-related death, five bombing incidents, and 115 security-related arrests in its 2021–22 reporting period.Prisons generally adhere to international guidelines but are overcrowded. Violence, self-harm, and the presence of drugs have also been reported. In a July 2022 report, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMI Prisons) raised concerns about the well-being of female prisoners and those kept in young offenders’ institutions. HMI Prisons also reported that some facilities holding immigrant detainees were “unfit for purpose.”",3,"Women receive equal treatment under the law but gender discrimination persists in the workplace and elsewhere in society. The authorities actively enforce a 2010 law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. However, the UK has recorded a sustained rise in hate crimes against LGBT+ residents over the past decade. The Home Office recorded a 41 percent increase in hate crimes based on sexual orientation from the 2020–21 to 2021–22 reporting periods. BAME residents face continued discrimination, including by the authorities. A 2022 review into the Metropolitan Police found systemic failings over its response to accusations of misogyny and racism by officers. Stop-and-search powers are disproportionally used against BAME people. Members of the Roma, Traveller, and related communities also face discrimination in the UK. In April 2022, Liberty criticized the PCSCA for antitrespassing provisions that it said could affect these communities.Foreign residents in the UK face considerable scrutiny. Under the ongoing “hostile environment” policy, which aims to persuade undocumented immigrants to voluntarily leave the UK or refrain from entering, individuals seeking public and private services face stringent immigration checks. Asylum seekers and migrants can be detained indefinitely, and there have been persistent reports of poor conditions and abuse in immigration detention centers.In April 2022, then prime minister Johnson announced a plan in which people whose asylum applications were deemed “inadmissible” in the UK would be sent to Rwanda for further consideration; they would either be invited to settle in Rwanda or be sent elsewhere depending on further determinations. The first flight to Rwanda was planned for June but was halted following a ruling by the ECtHR. In December, the High Court ruled the plan lawful; NGOs challenging the policy said they would consider an appeal.Under the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which received royal assent in April, asylum seekers entering the UK through means deemed irregular may receive less support; the law also increased the burden of proof for refugee claims. The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, warned that the act may violate international law. The bill makes it possible for the home secretary to strip individuals of their British citizenship—a power already available via preexisting legislation—without notice.",3
uruguay,Uruguay’s judiciary is generally independent.,4,"Due process rights are generally respected in Uruguay. However, the courts face a significant case backlog, which results in a high rate of pretrial detention.",3,"Uruguay is generally free from large-scale violence and civil conflict. However, criminal violence and insecurity have escalated in recent years, largely as a result of the increased scale of drug trafficking in the country. In addition to the violence caused by fighting between domestic drug trafficking gangs, warfare between rival gangs in Brazil has at times migrated across the border. According to the Ministry of the Interior, 383 homicides were recorded in the country in 2022, an approximately 25 percent increase from 2021. Prisons are often severely overcrowded, with poor living conditions. In 2021, the Interior Minister reported that prison conditions had deteriorated to the point that they violate human rights standards, and called for a long-term strategic plan to overhaul the system. In September 2022, two fires were caused by an inmate in a prison in Maldonado, requiring several people to be hospitalized; one person later died.",3,"Afro-Uruguayan people continue to face economic and social inequalities. Though a 2013 affirmative action law was enacted to combat persistent inequality, Afro-Uruguayans continued to experience high unemployment rates and economic hardship. The state still falls well short of its quota goals for jobs for individuals of African descent.Transgender people have historically been discriminated against in Uruguay, and violence against transgender people remains prevalent. However, a 2018 law allows transgender people to change relevant information on their identification documents and sets aside funds to help ensure that they have access to education and health care, among other things. Women enjoy equal rights under the law but face discriminatory attitudes and practices, including a persistent wage gap.",4
uzbekistan,"The judiciary remains subservient to the president. In 2017, however, a number of judicial reforms were enacted through constitutional and legislative amendments, establishing specific terms in office for judges and creating a Supreme Judicial Council (OSK) to oversee appointments and disciplinary action, among other changes. The council, whose chairperson is approved by the Senate on the president’s recommendation, replaced a commission that was directly subordinate to the president.",0,"Due process guarantees are extremely weak. Law enforcement authorities have routinely justified the arrest of suspected religious extremists or political opponents by planting contraband, filing dubious charges of financial wrongdoing, or inventing witness testimony. The Lawyers’ Chamber, a regulatory body with compulsory membership, serves as a vehicle for state control over the legal profession. The judicial reforms adopted in 2017 gave judges rather than prosecutors the authority to approve certain investigative steps, such as exhumations and some forms of surveillance. In 2020, a presidential decree introduced an option for defendants to enter plea bargains for a range of offenses and included provisions to improve detainees’ access to lawyers.",0,"A 2016 law on police prohibits torture, and a 2017 presidential decree that bars courts from using evidence obtained through torture took effect in 2018. In both 2020 and 2021, Mirziyoyev issued additional decrees introducing mechanisms to eliminate the use of torture against detainees. Despite the reforms, credible reports of physical abuse against detainees continued throughout 2022.In 2020, Andijon businessman Alijon Abdukarimov died following severe torture during police interrogation, sparking widespread public outrage. The prosecutor general’s office brought charges against the officers implicated in the case, and six officers received sentences ranging from one to 10 years in prison. The prosecutor general’s office publicized data on torture investigations for the first time in June 2020, admitting that of 757 cases investigated in three years, only 33 had led to prosecution. The human rights ombudsman acknowledged the same month that torture remained a serious problem, and the Interior Ministry announced that video cameras would be installed in police interrogation facilities across the country.International human rights organizations have condemned the government’s crackdown on protests in Karakalpakstan in July 2022—which saw security forces use extreme and sometimes lethal force to disperse mostly peaceful protesters—as excessive and unjustifiable. Though the government formed a commission to investigate human rights violations during the protests in mid-July, as of December it had not shared any findings. Prisons suffer from severe overcrowding and shortages of food and medicine. As with detained suspects, prison inmates—particularly those sentenced for their religious beliefs—are often subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.",1,"Although racial and ethnic discrimination are prohibited by law, the belief that senior positions in government and business are reserved for ethnic Uzbeks is widespread. Women’s educational and professional prospects are limited by discriminatory cultural and religious norms. Women are also barred from certain jobs under the labor code.Sex between men is punishable with up to three years in prison. The law does not protect LGBT+ people from discrimination, and social taboos deter the discussion of LGBT+ issues.",0
vanuatu,"The judiciary is largely independent, but a lack of resources hinders the hiring and retention of qualified judges and prosecutors. The president appoints the chief justice after consulting with the prime minister and the opposition leader. Other judges are appointed by the president on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission; judges cannot be removed arbitrarily. Tribal chiefs and island courts empowered to hear customary law cases adjudicate local disputes. Vanuatu’s courts have demonstrated impartiality in recent years through their adjudication of cases involving senior political figures.In June 2022, the Loughman government abandoned plans to introduce a five-year term for the chief justice after the opposition and Transparency International objected to the reform package that included the proposal.",4,"Due process rights are guaranteed by law. However, police do not always uphold legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. Long periods of pretrial detention are not uncommon, largely due to case backlogs in the courts. However, Vanuatu’s pretrial population is relatively low for the region.",3,"The police paramilitary unit, the Vanuatu Mobile Force, has a reputation for heavy-handed treatment of citizens. Civilian authorities have not been effective in punishing and preventing cases of police brutality.Prisons have suffered from overcrowding, violence, poor living conditions, and lax management that contributes to frequent escapes.",3,"Women are guaranteed legal equality, but they face societal discrimination that affects their access to employment and economic opportunity in practice.

venezuela,"The politicization of the judicial branch, which increased dramatically under former president Hugo Chávez, has progressed further under Maduro. In April 2022, the PSUV-controlled National Assembly chose 20 new judges for the TSJ under legislation that reduced the court’s size from 32 judges. Of those selected, several were already serving on the old court, raising concerns that they would violate a constitutionally limited term of 12 years. The TSJ has issued numerous decisions that favored the Maduro regime in recent years, and UN experts have repeatedly criticized the judiciary’s lack of independence.",0,"Perceived opponents of the government and the PSUV are routinely detained and prosecuted without regard for due process, including civilians and service members who are brought before military courts. As of May 2022 there were a reported 191 members of the military in detention on charges such as treason or incitement to rebellion. The military has also assumed roles previously reserved for civilian law enforcement institutions.Victims of violence at the hands of the state have no realistic avenue for redress. A 2021 UN report noted that prosecutors and judiciary members have effectively aided the regime’s human rights abuses.",0,"Venezuelans face physical insecurity and violence from several sources, including irregular armed groups, security forces, and organized gangs. Provea and the Gumilla Center reported in 2022 that they had documented 1,414 alleged extrajudicial executions by police and military forces in 2021, and the NGO Citizen Control accused security personnel of preferring to execute suspected criminals rather than arrest them.NGOs and local political leaders called on the government to address the threat of Colombian guerrilla groups and criminal organizations that continued to operate on the Venezuelan side of the border in 2022. Fundaredes documented dozens of kidnappings, disappearances, and murders in the border states during the year. The Venezuelan Violence Observatory (OVV) found that the country’s overall rate of violent death—including homicides by civilians, deaths at the hands of the authorities, and other suspicious deaths—was 35.3 per 100,000 people in 2022—or 40.4 if disappearances with a significant suspicion of death are included. The country has consistently registered one of the highest rates of violent death in Latin America.Prison conditions in Venezuela are also among the worst in the region. The Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons (OVP) found that of 126 prisoners who died in 2021, most succumbed to malnutrition and tuberculosis. A total of 773 inmates had died of malnutrition in the preceding four years, the group reported. Security conditions in detention facilities are also poor. Pranes, or gang leaders who operate from prisons, freely coordinate criminal networks throughout Venezuela.",0,"Constitutional protections against discrimination based on sex, race, and other characteristics are not well enforced in practice. Women continue to face significant disparities in education, compensation, and employment, and they have been disproportionately affected by the country’s politically driven economic crisis.The rights of Indigenous people, who make up 2.5 percent of the population, are guaranteed by the constitution but poorly protected by authorities. Indigenous groups often experience discrimination, especially in the states of Bolívar and Amazonas, where they are subject to labor exploitation, extortion by military and paramilitary groups, sex trafficking of some women, and land grabs related to illegal mining, which has resulted in the destruction of forests and other natural resources on which Indigenous residents depend. In September 2022, UN investigators reported “arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, extortion, corporal punishment, and sexual and gender-based violence” in the mining region of Bolívar State. Virgilio Trujillo, an Indigenous leader in Amazonas, was assassinated in June 2022, and a group of three Indigenous people were murdered in Bolívar in July, allegedly by illegal armed groups that operate in the area.Although discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited in employment and some other areas, LGBT+ Venezuelans face widespread intolerance and violence. Same-sex sexual activity remains criminalized within the military.",1
vietnam,"The judiciary is subservient to the CPV, which controls the courts at all levels. This control is especially evident in politically sensitive criminal prosecutions, with judges sometimes displaying greater impartiality in civil cases.",1,"Constitutional guarantees of due process are generally not upheld. Defendants have a legal right to counsel, but lawyers are scarce, and many are reluctant to take on cases involving sensitive topics. Defense lawyers do not have the right to call witnesses, and often report insufficient time to meet with their clients. In national security cases, police can detain suspects for up to 20 months without access to counsel.",1,"There is little protection from the illegitimate use of force by state authorities, and security personnel are known to abuse suspects and prisoners, sometimes resulting in death or serious injury. The death penalty can be applied for crimes other than murder, including drug trafficking; executions are carried out, but related statistics are considered a state secret.",1,"Members of ethnic and religious minority groups face societal discrimination, and some local officials restrict their access to schooling and jobs. They also sometimes encounter harassment by authorities seeking to suppress dissent and suspected links to exile groups.Men and women receive similar treatment in the legal and education systems. Economic opportunities for women have grown, though they are still subject to discrimination on wages and promotions.The law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and societal discrimination remains a problem. Nevertheless, LGBT+ pride events are held annually across the country.",1
yemen,"The judiciary, though nominally independent, is susceptible to interference from various political factions and armed groups. Authorities have a poor record of enforcing judicial rulings, particularly those issued against prominent tribal or political leaders. Lacking an effective court system, citizens often resort to tribal forms of justice and customary law—practices that have increased as state institutions continue to deteriorate. Criminal courts in Houthi-controlled areas remain active, but they are used as a political instrument by the Houthi leadership, according to UN experts. The judicial system is mostly inoperative in some other parts of the country.In September 2022, the Yemeni Judges Club organized a strike in the capital to protest an incident in which a judge was abducted and later killed by suspected Houthi militants; the judge had reportedly ruled on land disputes involving Houthi figures.",1,"Arbitrary detention is common, with hundreds of cases documented in recent years. Many amount to enforced disappearances, with no available information about the victims’ status or location. Detainees are often held at unofficial detention sites. As with other state institutions, security and intelligence agencies like the Political Security Organization have been split into parallel structures aligned with the different sides in the civil war. In areas that lie within the UAE’s sphere of influence in southern Yemen, Emirati special forces have operated a network of secret prisons and detention centers where torture is said to be rife. Human rights lawyers have faced detention or intimidation by both Houthi and official government authorities, particularly when they attempt to represent high-profile defendants.",0,"The civil war has included periods of acute violence across the country. Saudi-led coalition air strikes have failed to distinguish between military and civilian targets, and artillery fire from Houthi forces has been similarly indiscriminate. A number of other armed factions, including foreign military units and extremist groups like AQAP, operate in the country with impunity for any abuses. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), some 158,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the beginning of 2015, including thousands during 2022 alone.The United Nations brokered a two-month truce between progovernment forces and the Houthis in April 2022, and it was renewed twice, in June and August, before lapsing in October when the Houthis declined to extend it. Although the truce led to increased mobility and a decline in air strikes and ground offensives, nearly 3,000 violations were reported, according to ACLED, including 374 air and drone attacks. Hundreds of civilians and combatants were killed as a result of protracted violence among the belligerent forces, as well as a resurgence in AQAP and tribal violence. After the truce lapsed, the progovernment side generally abided by its main terms through the end of the year. While the Houthis carried out attacks on oil-related targets in the government-held southeast in October and November, there was no resumption of large-scale combat.",0,"Despite the growing sectarian rift between the Sunni Muslim majority and the large Zaidi Shiite minority, Yemen is relatively homogeneous in terms of language and ethnicity. However, the Muhamasheen are subject to severe social discrimination and poverty. Women also continue to encounter discrimination in many aspects of life, and their testimony in court is equivalent to half that of a man. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal, with possible penalties including lashes, imprisonment, and death. Due to the severe threats they face, few LGBT+ Yemenis reveal their identity.Migrants and refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Horn of Africa continue to arrive in Yemen. Many of those entering were seeking work in the Persian Gulf states but met with harsh conditions, violence, and barriers to further travel once in Yemen. Effective legal protections and basic supplies are also lacking for internally displaced persons (IDPs), most of whom perform unskilled jobs in the informal economy.",0

In October 2022, Hichilema named Gilbert Phiri director of public prosecutions, replacing Lilian Siyuni, a Lungu appointee. Siyuni, whose involvement in the corruption case of a Lungu-appointed mine liquidator led to disagreements with Hichilema, contested the move at the Constitutional Court but Phiri’s appointment took effect by December.",2,"Pretrial detainees are sometimes held for years without trial owing to case backlogs. Many of the accused lack legal representation. Bail is frequently denied to detainees. In rural areas, customary courts of variable quality—whose decisions often conflict with the constitution and national law—decide many civil matters. In September 2022, the Human Rights Commission called on the police to more speedily bring suspects to court and grant bail.",2,"Allegations of police brutality, including the use of torture to extract confessions, are widespread. Security forces generally operate with impunity. Conditions in pretrial detention facilities and prisons are poor, with reports of forced labor, abuse of inmates by authorities, and deplorable health conditions.In December 2022, the government removed a penal-code provision allowing for the death penalty. However, the penalty still remains in Bill of Rights, which can only be amended by a referendum. No executions have taken place since 1997.",2,"Women are constitutionally guaranteed the same rights as men, but gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment are prevalent in practice. Same-sex sexual activity is criminalized and is punishable by up to life in prison. LGBT+ groups faced opposition from religious and anti-LGBT+ activists for their apparent participation at a September 2022 fashion event in Lusaka. That month, Home Affairs Minister Jacob Mwiimbu reiterated the illegality of same-sex activity and warned that the government would prosecute cases.Refugees are protected under local and international law but often suffer from limited access to basic services and gender-based violence. As of October 2022, Zambia hosted nearly 67,000 refugees, many from the Democratic Republic of Congo.",2
zimbabwe,"Pressure on the courts to endorse executive actions and protect ZANU-PF’s interests has eroded the judiciary’s independence. Judges occasionally rule against the government in sensitive cases, and such rulings are not always respected.Individual judges faced a further loss in independence when Chief Justice Luke Malaba issued a directive instructing them to clear rulings with superiors in 2020. Malaba rescinded his directive after fierce criticism later that month.Under a 2021 constitutional amendment, Constitutional Court and Supreme Court judges will retire at 75 instead of at 70, allowing the president to extend Malaba’s contested position. Senior judges joining the bench for the first time are now appointed by the president in consultation with the Judicial Service Commission instead of being subjected to public interviews. The introduction of the amendment contravened the constitution, as it did not follow procedures requiring a 90-day notice period to allow for public input.",1,"Constitutionally stipulated due process protections are not enforced.
