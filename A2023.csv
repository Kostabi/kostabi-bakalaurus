afghanistan,"The Taliban overthrew an elected government in 2021; that September, the Taliban declared the formation of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) and installed an unelected cabinet. Mohammad Hasan Akhund, the head of the movement’s Rehbari Shura (Leadership Council), was named prime minister and remained in that post as of the end of 2022. Haibatullah Akhundzada, the movement’s leader, was named the IEA’s supreme leader, or amir. Akhundzada exercised unfettered powers to rule by decree and make all appointments to state bodies.",0,"No legislative assembly or representative body operates in the IEA. Akhundzada’s decrees and orders from ministers have taken the place of legislation and regulation. A bicameral National Assembly existed under the 2004 constitution. The last assembly was constituted after elections in 2018 but many of its members went into exile after the republic fell.In March 2022, the Taliban allowed residents in Kabul to vote for local representatives to liaise with the authorities.",0,"Under the republic, elections were administered by the Independent Election Commission and disputes adjudicated by the Electoral Complaints Commission. Both were abolished in late 2021. Besides the March 2022 polls in Kabul, there is no provision for elections in the IEA.In 2021, the Taliban announced that they would enforce parts of the 1964 constitution that did not contradict their interpretation of Sharia, rejecting the 2004 constitution used by the republic. In September 2022, Deputy Justice Minister Abdul Karim Haider said the country did not need a constitution, and instead need only rely on the Quran, the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad—referring to a collection of social and legal customs that informs Sharia—and Islamic jurisprudence.",0
albania,"The president is the head of state and is elected by the parliament for a maximum of two five-year terms; the office does not hold executive power, though the president has some authority over the judiciary and the armed forces. The prime minister is the head of government and is designated by the majority party or coalition. Because both the president and prime minister are selected by lawmakers, their legitimacy is generally dependent on the conduct of parliamentary elections. In June 2022, the parliament elected defense chief Bajram Begaj to succeed Ilir Meta as president. Meta had been impeached by lawmakers in 2021 over his conduct during that year’s electoral period, but the Constitutional Court overruled the parliament in February 2022, allowing him to complete his term. The PD boycotted the vote, with opposition lawmakers voicing concerns over whether his status as a military officer made his selection unconstitutional. Begaj took office in late July. Socialist Party (PS) leader Edi Rama began his third term as prime minister following the April 2021 parliamentary elections.",3,"The unicameral, 140-member Kuvendi (Assembly) is elected through proportional representation in 12 regional districts of varying size corresponding to administrative regions. All members serve four-year terms.The ruling PS maintained its parliamentary majority in the April 2021 polls, winning 49 percent of the vote and 74 seats. The PD won 39 percent of the vote and 59 seats, while the Freedom Party (then known as the Socialist Movement of Integration) took 4 seats. Turnout stood at 46.3 percent.The elections were administered under reforms adopted in 2020, ensuring the participation of opposition parties including the PD, which had boycotted previous polls. International observers called the elections well-organized and competitive. However, the elections were also marred by irregularities, including allegations of widespread vote buying, the misuse of administrative resources by the PS, and media bias that allowed the PS to “derive significant advantage from its incumbency.” Despite such flaws, the results were widely accepted by stakeholders.",3,"The Central Election Commission (CEC) administers polls. In 2020, the parliament established the Political Council, comprised of representatives of the three largest parties, to address electoral reforms recommended by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The parliament adopted several provisions of the Council’s plan to gradually depoliticize election administration, introduce electronic identification of voters where technically possible, and restructure the CEC, among other changes. The CEC received additional responsibilities via these reforms.The April 2021 elections were administered by the newly restructured CEC and were the first polls conducted after reforms were adopted in 2020. Despite concerns about the CEC’s ability to manage the polls after the parliament’s “extremely hasty” adoption of the electoral amendments, international observers reported that the elections proceeded smoothly and were competently and transparently administered.",3
algeria,"The president, who is directly elected for five-year terms, remains the dominant figure in the executive branch, though some authority was shifted to the prime minister under constitutional reforms adopted in 2020.A two-term limit has been in effect since 2016, but it did not apply to the prior terms of longtime president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, whose plans to seek a fifth consecutive term sparked the Hirak protests in 2019. Bouteflika resigned that April after losing the support of the armed forces.Former prime minister Abdelmajid Tebboune won the December 2019 presidential election with 58 percent of the vote. Abdelaziz Belaïd of the Future Front, the only candidate who had not served in cabinet posts under Bouteflika, won 7 percent. Voter turnout was reportedly as low as 20 percent. Protesters called the election a sham and orchestrated a boycott. Outside observers were not allowed to enter the country to monitor the poll.The president nominates the prime minister after consulting with the parliamentary majority. Tebboune appointed then finance minister Ayman Benabderrahmane as prime minister in 2021.",1,"The 407 members of the National People’s Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, are directly elected to five-year terms, which can only be renewed once under the 2020 constitutional reforms. In early elections held in 2021, the ruling FLN won 98 seats, while the allied National Democratic Rally (RND) took 58. The Islamist Movement of Society for Peace (MSP) won 65 seats, the Future Front captured 48, and the moderate Islamist National Construction Movement (El-Binaa) took 39. No other party won more than 10 seats, though 84 independent lawmakers were elected. The MSP and El-Binaa alleged that the elections were marred by fraud, while Hirak supporters boycotted the polls. Nationwide turnout stood at 23 percent. The Independent National Authority for Elections (ANIE) reported that over 360 polling facilities were shuttered due to looting and other disruptions.The president appoints one-third of the members of the upper house, the Council of the Nation, which has 144 members serving six-year terms. The other two-thirds are indirectly elected by local and provincial assemblies. Half of the chamber’s mandates are renewed every three years. Partial upper house elections took place in February 2022. The FLN took the most seats, securing 25, while independents took 14, RND took 11, and the Future Front and the Socialist Forces Front (FFS) took 5 and 2 seats, respectively. Local and regional elections were held amid low turnout in 2021. The FLN and RND won the most town council seats and a plurality of regional assembly seats.",1,"Prior to 2019, Algeria’s elections were administered by the Interior Ministry and were often subject to government interference. Pressure from protesters ultimately forced the government to establish the ANIE. However, the slate of approved presidential candidates that was announced ahead of the 2019 presidential election was dominated by Bouteflika-era officials, raising doubts about the efficacy of the electoral reforms. The absence of international election monitors drew criticism from Algerian civil society.Constitutional reforms were adopted through a 2020 referendum that was marred by low voter turnout. Reform-package opponents, including Hirak activists, had called for a boycott after being prevented from campaigning or airing their views on state media.",1
andorra,"Andorra has a parliamentary system, with a prime minister elected by and accountable to the legislature. The legitimacy of the prime minister, usually the head of the party with the most seats, rests largely on the conduct of parliamentary elections, which have historically been competitive and credible. Xavier Espot Zamora, the new leader of the ruling Democrats for Andorra (DA) party, became prime minister in 2019 following that year’s elections. Two “co-princes,” the French president and the Roman Catholic bishop of La Seu d’Urgell, Spain, serve jointly as Andorra’s ceremonial heads of state.",4,"Members of the unicameral, 28-member Consell General are directly elected every four years through a mixed voting system. In the 2019 elections, the DA led with 11 seats, followed by the Social Democratic Party (PS) with 7, the Liberals of Andorra (LA) and the new conservative party Third Way (TV) with 4 each, and the new social-liberal party Committed Citizens (CC) with 2. The LA and CC joined the DA in a governing coalition. The polls were considered competitive, credible, and well-administered.",4,"The Electoral Law, which was last changed in 2014 to introduce regulations on campaign finance, provides a sound framework for free and fair elections. The Electoral Board supervises elections impartially. However, the law does not provide a formal role for international or citizen observers.",4
angola,"There is no separate election for the president, either by voters or by the legislature. Under the 2010 constitution, the head of the national list of the political party that receives the most votes in legislative elections automatically becomes president, without any parliamentary confirmation process. Despite this lack of an individual mandate, the constitution permits the president to unilaterally appoint and dismiss the vice president, cabinet, and provincial governors, among other important powers. The president may serve up to two five-year terms.The intraparty procedures for choosing presidential candidates are not competitive. At a December 2021 congress of the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), incumbent president João Lourenço was confirmed as the head of the party’s 2022 electoral list, receiving 98 percent of the votes from party delegates; there were no other nominees. He then secured a new presidential term after the MPLA won the August 2022 parliamentary elections. Lourenço had similarly faced no opponents at a 2016 party congress that set the stage for his first presidential term.",0,"Members of the 220-seat, unicameral National Assembly are elected to five-year terms by proportional representation.In the August 2022 elections, the MPLA won 51.2 percent of the vote and 124 seats, while the opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and its coalition took 44.0 percent and 90 seats. Three smaller parties won the remainder.The African Union Election Observation Mission reported that the elections were generally peaceful, but noted limits on the right of access to information and freedom of the press as well as reports of an uneven playing field. Civil society organizations found that biased progovernment media, deficiencies in voter registration processes, and the MPLA’s use of public resources in its campaign disadvantaged the opposition. The observation mission of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, while praising some aspects of the process, pointed to the fact that voter lists contained many deceased individuals.A legal complaint in which UNITA and other opposition parties challenged the election results was rejected by the MPLA-controlled Constitutional Court in September. Opposition lawmakers took up their seats in the National Assembly but vowed to continue questioning the results.",2,"The law states that the makeup of the National Election Commission (CNE) should reflect the disposition of power in the National Assembly, which gives an advantage to the MPLA. Voter registration is carried out by the government through its Ministry of Territorial Administration. Ahead of the 2022 elections, the voter list was audited to assess its integrity, but stakeholders raised concerns about a lack of transparency in the audit firm’s appointment and findings. The CNE is legally required to disclose voter lists for each polling station at least 30 days prior to election day, but it failed to comply with this provision in 2022.Articles 11 and 27 of the Law on Elections Observation empowered the CNE to limit the number of national and international observers, and it set a ceiling of 2,000 national observers for the 2022 elections, further undermining electoral transparency.A joint statement signed by civil society groups and delivered to the CNE in August pointed to irregularities in electoral preparations. After the elections, civil society observers also cited failures to display voter lists and publish summary minutes at many polling stations. The final results were reportedly disclosed without prior notification of political parties, in violation of the law; UNITA said it had been excluded from the disclosure process.",1
antigua-and-barbuda,"The country’s 1981 constitution establishes a parliamentary system, with a governor general representing the British monarch as ceremonial head of state.

The governing ABLP took 59 percent of the total vote and won 15 constituencies in the 2018 elections. The main opposition United Progressive Party (UPP) took 37 percent of the vote, but only one constituency. Observers deemed the polls generally competitive and credible. The Barbuda Council also holds regular elections.",4,"Electoral laws are generally fair and are implemented impartially by the relevant election management bodies. However, since 1984, the electoral boundaries of Antigua and Barbuda have shifted only slightly, which has created a significant disparity in the range of constituency sizes: from 1,138 (St. Phillip South) to 4,878 (St. George).",4
argentina,"The constitution provides for a president to be elected for a four-year term, with the option of reelection for one additional term. Presidential candidates must win 45 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff.Center-left candidate Alberto Fernández of the Front for Everyone (FdT) coalition was elected in the first round of elections in October 2019 with 48.2 percent of the vote, defeating incumbent Mauricio Macri of the Together for Change (JxC) bloc, who obtained 40.3 percent. International observers deemed the poll competitive and credible.Fernández’s victory was widely viewed as benefiting from having political veteran and former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner on his ticket. A member of the populist Peronist movement, she was the subject of multiple allegations of corruption at the time of the election.",4,"The National Congress consists of a lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, and an upper house, the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies has 257 members elected for four-year terms, and the Senate has 72 members elected for six-year terms. Half of all deputies and a third of senators are up for election every two years through a proportional-representation system with closed party lists. Legislative contests are generally deemed free and fair.The FdT did poorly against JxC in the November 2021 legislative elections, marking an end to a decades-long majority for Peronist-led coalitions, although the governing coalition maintained a narrow plurality in both houses. The FdT notably lost ground in Buenos Aires Province, while the left-wing Workers’ Left Front and the far-right Freedom Advances did well nationally.",4,"Argentina has a clear and relatively fair framework for conducting elections. There is universal suffrage: voting is compulsory for people between 18 and 70 years old, and voluntary for people between 16 and 18 or older than 70.However, the system suffers from shortcomings, including the inconsistent enforcement of electoral laws and campaign finance regulations. Additionally, each party must print and distribute its own paper ballots on election day, providing opportunities for abuse and favoring larger parties. Aspects of election management fall under the purview of the executive branch; the National Electoral Chamber (CNE) works in conjunction with the National Electoral Directorate (DNE), a department of the Interior Ministry.",3
armenia,"Constitutional changes in 2015 transformed the country from a semipresidential to a parliamentary republic. The president is chosen by the parliament for a single seven-year term, and most executive power lies with the prime minister, who is chosen by a parliamentary majority. In January 2022, President Armen Sargsyan, who had been elected before the 2018 revolution, resigned. Vahagn Khachaturyan, who was serving as minister of high-tech industry, was elected as president.In June 2021, Nikol Pashinyan’s Civil Contract Party won a majority of seats in snap elections called after Pashinyan resigned as prime minister in April. The party’s electoral victory allowed him to retain his position as prime minister. Though Pashinyan’s win was contested by the opposition, the Constitutional Court upheld the election results, and local and international observers considered the elections to be free and fair, despite some irregularities.",2,"The National Assembly consists of a minimum of 101 members elected for five-year terms under a newly adopted closed-list proportional representation system, simplifying the previous two-tier proportional representation system. Up to four additional seats are reserved for ethnic minority representatives, and further seats can be added to ensure that opposition parties hold at least 30 percent of the seats.In April 2021, Pashinyan resigned as prime minister, triggering snap parliamentary elections that June. Three parties gained seats in the June parliamentary elections, with Pashinyan’s Civil Contract Party winning a stable majority of 71 seats with 53.9 percent of the vote. The new Armenia Alliance, led by former president Robert Kocharyan, gained 29 seats with 21.1 percent of the vote. Another new bloc, the I Have Honor Alliance, founded by former president Serzh Sargsyan (unrelated to Armen Sargsyan), gained 7 seats after receiving 5.2 percent of the vote, though one representative left I Have Honor to become an independent lawmaker in December. Though party alliances are required to meet a 7 percent electoral threshold, the threshold was waived for Sargsyan’s alliance, as Armenian law mandates that legislature must be composed of no fewer than three parties.Local and international observers deemed the elections to be competitive, well-organized, and fairly administered, though there were some irregularities.",2,"Members of the Central Election Commission (CEC) are recommended and then confirmed by the parliament for six-year terms. According to international observers, during the June 2021 elections, the CEC conducted its work in a transparent and efficient manner, meeting all legal deadlines and enjoying a high level of confidence in its capacity to deliver its mandate. In October 2022, Vahagn Hovakimyan, a member of the ruling party, was elected head of CEC, drawing concerns from civil society groups about the independence and neutrality of the CEC.In April 2021, the parliament amended existing electoral laws to reflect recommendations made by the Venice Commission and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) within the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The June snap elections were successfully administered under the reformed system, which eliminated territorial lists, simplifying the existing electoral system. The amendments enjoyed broad support by political forces and civil society; further reforms were also adopted in May 2021.",3
australia,"The Australian government is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy. The leader of the popularly elected majority party or coalition is designated as prime minister, and serves as head of government. Anthony Albanese, leader of the Labor Party, became prime minister after free and fair federal elections in May 2022. His predecessor, Scott Morrison of the Liberal Party, was the first prime minister to serve an uninterrupted three-year term since 2007. The 2010s saw the premiership frequently switch hands following “leadership coups” in which politicians within the major parties contested the party leadership and, in turn, the office of prime minister. This pattern drew criticism for failing to reflect the will of the electorate, and both Labor and the Liberals have reformed their internal rules to make leadership challenges more difficult.A governor-general, appointed on the recommendation of the prime minister, represents the monarch of the United Kingdom (UK) as head of state. The powers of the monarchy are extremely limited. David Hurley was appointed governor-general in 2019.The September 2022 death of Queen Elizabeth II triggered debate about whether Australia should become a republic. Republican sentiment is divided in Australia, with polls in late 2022 showing between 40 and 46 percent of respondents supporting calls for an Australian head of state. Following the Australian Labor Party’s victory in the 2022 election, the Albanese government created a new post, assistant minister for the republic, fueling speculation that it might push for a referendum on the issue.",4,"The bicameral legislative branch consists of a 151-member House of Representatives and 76-member Senate. Lower house members are elected through a ranked-choice ballot, and serve three-year terms. Senators are elected through a ranked-choice ballot and serve staggered six-year terms. The 2022 federal election saw the Labor Party returned to power after almost a decade in opposition after winning 77 seats in the House of Representatives, enough to form a single-party majority. The previous ruling coalition, composed of longtime partners the Liberal Party and the National Party, won less than 40 percent of seats in the lower house, losing 19 seats in the worst electoral defeat for Australian conservative parties in decades. Several senior Liberal Party figures, most notably Deputy Leader Josh Frydenberg, lost seats traditionally held safely by the party. Scott Morrison kept his seat, but was replaced as party leader soon after the election by Peter Dutton.However, the coalition’s resounding defeat did not translate to a landslide victory for the Labor Party, with Independent candidates and the Greens gaining ground. Six lower house seats were claimed by so-called “teal Independents,” named for the color many of them used for their campaign signs, a loose association of mostly female Independent candidates. Many had no background in politics, but campaigned on transparency and climate and environmental issues. Teal candidates notably won some usually safe Liberal seats. Independent candidates who were not associated with the teal movement won four seats.The Greens, a left-wing party traditionally aligned with Labor, won four seats in the lower house, an increase of three from the 2019 elections, while two minor parties, Centre Alliance and Katter’s Australian Party, won one seat each.Forty seats in the Senate were filled in the same contest. Labor and the Liberal-National coalition each won 15 seats; the Greens won 6; and the remaining seats were divided between Independents and minor parties, with one going to the far-right One Nation Party. Turnout for the election stood at 89.8 percent.On Election Day, the Liberal Party drew criticism for sending an SMS message to millions of voters detailing the interception of a boat carrying asylum seekers travelling to Australia. The SMS message urged voters to “keep our borders secure by voting Liberal today.” Asylum seekers, particularly those arriving unlawfully by boat, are a hot-button issue in Australian politics and the text message was widely viewed as a scare campaign. Correspondence released under freedom of information laws after the election revealed that the Morrison Government had pressured immigration officials to prepare and release a statement about the interception while events were still unfolding, and that officials described the request as “astonishing in form and timing.” and ”unprecedented.”",4,"Australian electoral laws and procedures are generally fair and impartial. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)—an independent federal agency—coordinates all federal elections and referendums, draws seat boundaries, and keeps the electoral rolls. Voting is compulsory, and a registered voter’s failure to vote may result in a small fine, which if unpaid can increase and ultimately lead to a criminal conviction.",4
austria,"Executive elections in Austria are generally free and fair. The president is elected for a six-year term and has predominantly ceremonial duties. The president does, however, have the right to dissolve parliament and appoints the chancellor, who also needs the support of the legislature to govern. President Alexander Van der Bellen, former Green Party leader, narrowly prevailed in 2016 against FPÖ candidate Norbert Hofer. The 2016 polls featured a runoff that was repeated twice after the Constitutional Court (VfGH) established that there had been problems with the handling of postal ballots. Van der Bellen was reelected to the presidency in October 2022 after securing an absolute majority of the vote.Following snap elections in 2019, an ÖVP–Green government took office in January 2020, marking the first time the Greens have participated in a national government. Sebastian Kurz of the ÖVP, who led the previous ÖVP–FPÖ coalition, returned as chancellor. Kurz was forced to resign the chancellorship in October 2021 over corruption allegations, and ultimately left politics altogether. After Kurz’s resignation, then foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg was appointed chancellor; Schallenberg resigned several weeks later, in December. In December 2021, ÖVP party officials chose then interior minister Karl Nehammer to become both party leader and chancellor.

The ÖVP was the clear winner with 71 seats, though it did not win a parliamentary majority. The Green Party returned after a two-year absence from parliament, winning 26 seats.

The British monarch was the head of state and was represented by a governor general until 2021, when Barbados became a republic. Former governor general Sandra Mason began serving a four-year term as president after being appointed by the prime minister and voted into the office by Parliament that year.",4,"Members of the 30-seat House of Assembly, the lower house, are directly elected for five-year terms. The upper house, the Senate, comprises 21 members appointed by the president: 12 are chosen by the prime minister, 2 are nominated on the advice of the opposition, and 7 are chosen by the president. Senators serve five-year terms. The BLP won 69 percent of the vote and all 30 lower-house seats in the snap January 2022 elections. The DLP won 27 percent of the vote. While the polls were credible, turnout stood at a record low at 41.7 percent. Some Barbadians were unable to cast ballots because they were in COVID-19 quarantine. A lawsuit over the issue was not allowed to proceed in mid-January for technical reasons. After the elections, Prime Minister Mottley said she would reach out to opposition parties to discuss senatorial appointments.",4,"The independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission oversees elections in Barbados in a professional manner. Its five commissioners are chosen based on expertise by the prime minister and the opposition for a term of five years.In January 2022, Prime Minister Mottley called for a constitutional amendment to allow an 18-year-old nominee to enter the Senate. The government decided not to pursue the matter further in March because it lacked sufficient support for such an amendment.The CRC, which is comprised of legal experts and civil society leaders selected by the attorney general, started work in June 2022 with a broad mandate to develop a constitution, including via public consultation, to be approved by Parliament. The CRC’s formation is widely seen as long overdue, but the CRC has been criticized as opposition members and some minority groups are not represented on it.",4
belarus,"The president is elected for five-year terms. A two-term limit, reintroduced by the 2022 amendments to the constitution, will be imposed after the next presidential election. Alyaksandr Lukashenka was first elected president in 1994, in the country’s only democratic election. The 2020 campaign period was heavily controlled by authorities, who permitted only 15 of 55 applicants to register as candidates. The government arrested two major candidates, Siarhei Tsikhanouski and Viktar Babaryka, and forced another, Valery Tsepkalo, to flee Belarus before voting day. Scores of activists were similarly arrested or fled. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya registered as a presidential candidate after her husband, Siarhei, was arrested. She received the endorsements of Maryia Kalesnikava and Veronika Tsepkalo, respectively representing the Babaryka and Tsepkalo campaigns. The three women, who led the largest opposition rallies in the country since the fall of the Soviet Union, experienced severe pressure from the authorities, and both Tsikhanouskaya and Veronika Tsepkalo went into exile after the election. Authorities failed to send a timely invitation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the elections took place without an independent monitoring mission. The government’s claim that Lukashenka won 80 percent of the vote was widely denounced as fraudulent. A parallel and independent vote count using the mobile phone application Golos, with data from nearly 23 percent of polling stations, revealed that Tsikhanouskaya likely received 13 times more votes than were reported. Protests after the announcement of the results were met with disproportionate force, including the use of live ammunition and mass, arbitrary detentions, among other abuses. By the end of 2020, 33,000 people had been detained and fined.In September 2020, amid ongoing massive protests and growing calls for a repeat election, Lukashenka inaugurated himself in a secret, unannounced ceremony.",0,"Legislative elections in Belarus are tightly restricted. The 110 members of the Chamber of Representatives, the lower house of the National Assembly, are elected by popular vote to four-year terms from single-mandate constituencies. The upper chamber, the Council of the Republic, consists of 64 members serving four-year terms; regional councils elect 56 and the president appoints 8.A parliamentary election was held in November 2019, nearly a year ahead of schedule. Candidates loyal to Lukashenka won every seat in the lower house, while independent candidates won none. OSCE election monitors reported an overall lack of transparency, restrictions on observation of the vote count, and indications of ballot box stuffing.",0,"The legal framework for elections fails to meet democratic standards, and authorities have dismissed OSCE recommendations to improve it. Electoral commission members of all levels are politically aligned with and dependent on the government; out of the 1,989 members of local electoral commissions formed for the 2020 presidential election, only two representatives of independent political parties were allowed to register. Independent observers have no access to ballot-counting processes. A national referendum on constitutional amendments that will further cement Lukashenka’s grip on power was held in February 2022. According to the Central Election Commission (CEC), the amendments passed with the support of 65 percent of voters. The voting process was characterized by numerous flaws, including the exclusion of independent observers. Opposition members were not permitted to campaign, while citizens residing abroad were not allowed to vote. Antigovernment demonstrations on election day resulted in the detention of more than 800 people, many of whom were protesting both the referendum and the war in Ukraine.The constitutional amendments reintroduced a two-term limit for presidents, which will take effect once a newly elected president assumes office and do not apply to Lukashenka’s current term. Lukashenka would thus be able to be reelected as president until 2035. Among other changes, the amendments also introduced a new governing body, the All-Belarus People’s Assembly, which has extensive executive powers. The amended constitution does not specify the election procedure for assembly members.",0
belgium,"The Belgian monarchy is largely ceremonial, although the king retains constitutional authority to mediate the process of government formation. He was particularly active in this role in 2020 as negotiations over a new government stalled. The prime minister, who is the leader of the majority party or coalition, is appointed by the monarch and approved by the legislature. In late September 2020, seven parties forged a parliamentary majority under the leadership of Alexander De Croo of the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats party, who was sworn in as prime minister that October.Belgium’s multilayered subnational administrative units have their own governments with varying degrees of autonomy. In addition to the three main geographic divisions of French-speaking Wallonia in the south, Flemish-speaking Flanders in the north, and the bilingual Brussels capital region, there are overlapping governments for the French community, the Flemish community, and the much smaller German-speaking community.",4,"Belgium’s federal parliament consists of two houses: the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. The 150 members of the lower house are elected directly by proportional representation. The Senate is composed of 50 members selected by community and regional parliaments, and an additional 10 members chosen by the first 50 based on the results of the Chamber of Representatives elections. Members serve five-year terms in both houses, and elections are generally free and fair.In the May 2019 elections, establishment parties lost significant shares of support to parties on the far left and far right of the political spectrum. For example, the right-wing, nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) lost some power, taking 25 seats in the Chamber of Representatives (down 8 seats), but the far-right, separatist Flemish Interest (VB) party won 18 seats, a gain of 15. On the left, the francophone Socialist Party (PS) won 20 seats, down 3 from the previous election, while the Greens—composed of the francophone Ecolo and their Flemish-speaking counterpart Groen—won a combined 21 seats. The leftist Workers’ Party of Belgium (PvdA in Flemish, PTB in French) also made major gains, rising from 2 seats to 12. A total of 12 parties won seats in the lower house. It took until September 2020 to form a new government, a delay that is not historically unusual for Belgium.In 2019, the German-speaking community launched a system of participatory democracy in which citizens are selected by lot to join a Citizens’ Council, which provides input on policy matters. A similar program has been introduced in the local parliaments in the Brussels region, and plans to launch related initiatives in other regions and at the national level were underway as of 2022.",4,"Despite the complexity of the political system, the electoral laws and framework are generally fair and impartially implemented.",4
belize,"The prime minister, usually the leader of the largest party in the parliament, is head of government. Formally, the prime minister is appointed by the governor general, who represents the British monarch as head of state. The legitimacy of the prime minister is largely dependent on the conduct of legislative elections, which are typically credible and well administered. After 17 years in opposition, the People’s United Party (PUP), under the leadership of Johnny Briceño, won a convincing victory in the 2020 elections, defeating the United Democratic Party (UDP).",4,"The 31 members of the House of Representatives are directly elected to five-year terms. The Senate has 12 seats. The ruling party, the opposition, and several civil associations select the senators, who are then appointed by the governor general.In the 2020 legislative polls, the opposition PUP won a landslide victory. Turnout was over 81 percent, the highest since 1998.",4,"Electoral laws are generally fair, although there is some politicization of the Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC). There are large differences in constituency size, and boundaries have not changed since 1984. In February 2022, a redistricting task force was created to make recommendations on how the disparities could be reduced. The redistricting process faced several delays in 2022, leading members of the opposition to express concerns about potential political interference in the process.In October 2022, the parliament passed the People’s Constitution Commission Act, beginning the process of comprehensive constitutional reform. The legislation was enacted in November, and the People’s Constitution Commission (PCC) was officially launched that month. The PCC, which is made up of representatives from Belize’s main political parties and 19 civil society organizations, is tasked with reviewing the existing constitution, holding consultations on constitutional reforms across Belize and among the Belizean diaspora, and issuing a final report on its findings.",4
benin,"The president is elected by popular vote for up to two five-year terms and serves as both the chief of state and head of government. In 2021, Patrice Talon won reelection as president with 86 percent of the vote. The authorities had disqualified, arrested, or forced into exile the major opposition candidates, leaving only two opponents who posed no significant competition. Elected members of progovernment parties had veto power over which candidates qualified for the ballot, and some opposition parties boycotted the election. Peaceful protesters against the unfair and noncompetitive contest were injured, and at least five people were killed after security forces fired tear gas and live ammunition into the air. Official voter turnout was 50 percent, a historic low for the country’s multiparty presidential contests; civil society groups estimate turnout at 26 percent. Observers described election day as “calm” and “orderly.”Constitutional amendments created the largely ceremonial position of vice president in 2019. Mariam Chabi Talata, Talon’s running mate in 2021, became the first to hold the office.",1,"Delegates to the 83-member, unicameral National Assembly serve four-year terms and are elected by proportional representation. The 2019 legislative elections were neither free nor fair, as new electoral rules effectively prevented all opposition parties from participating. Observers canceled poll-monitoring plans for fear of violence, turnout fell to about a quarter of eligible voters amid an opposition boycott, there was an internet shutdown on election day, and security forces violently suppressed protests before and after balloting, resulting in several deaths. Only the two progovernment parties on the ballot won seats. In November 2021, the new National Assembly adopted constitutional amendments, including provisions imposing three-term limits on legislators, expanding the body to 109 seats, and extending terms to five years beginning in 2026 to align them with those of the president. The government ignored a call by the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights (AfCHPR) for these amendments’ repeal before the presidential election.Municipal elections were held in 2020, ignoring an AfCHPR order to suspend them and ensure opposition participation. Sébastien Ajavon, a businessman living in exile after receiving a drug trafficking conviction in 2018, had sued after opposition parties were barred from participating. The Progressive Union and the Republican Bloc won most local council seats, while the Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin (FCBE), the only opposition group to field candidates, won 14 percent of them. In 2021, the AfCHPR ruled in Ajavon’s case that Benin had violated its human rights obligations.",1,"Elections are conducted by the Autonomous National Electoral Commission (CENA). Following the passage of a restrictive electoral law in 2018, the Constitutional Court ruled that parties must obtain a “certificate of conformity” from the Interior Ministry. In 2019, CENA approved only two progovernment parties for the legislative election. CENA also barred most opposition groups from the 2020 local elections. Legislative elections scheduled for 2023 will be run by a restructured CENA largely appointed by Talon and his allies. As of the end of 2022, seven parties—four progovernment, three opposition—were registered to contest the 2023 elections. CENA initially disqualified the main opposition party, the Democrats, in November 2022 for failing to provide required tax information. The party was ultimately allowed to register after appealing the decision to the Constitutional Court, which found in the party’s favor later that month. Due to a 2019 amendment requiring presidential candidates to be endorsed by 10 percent of mayors and members of the National Assembly, the disqualifications of opposition parties in the 2019 and 2020 elections empowered members of Talon’s party to disqualify all but two candidates for the 2021 presidential election.",1

King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck formally succeeded his father in 2008.The monarch nominates the leader of the majority party in the elected National Assembly to serve as prime minister.

Members of both houses serve five-year terms. The king appoints five members of the nonpartisan National Council, and the remaining 20 are popularly elected. The National Assembly is entirely elected. The April 2018 National Council election saw record turnout; some observers ascribed the higher turnout to reforms such as a new postal voting system that were designed to encourage voting and make casting ballots easier. The National Assembly election was held in two rounds in September and October 2018, with the two parties that won the most support in the first round advancing to the second. The DNT, which launched in 2013, won 30 seats. The Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party (DPT) won 17.

bolivia,"Bolivia’s president is both chief of state and head of government, and is directly elected to a five-year term. The presidential election in October 2020 took place after the results of the 2019 election were annulled. Early results of the 2019 presidential election suggested that a runoff between incumbent Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism (MAS) and the main opposition candidate, former president Carlos Mesa of the Comunidad Ciudadana (Citizen Community) party, was likely. Soon after, election officials released an updated vote count showing Morales with an outright victory, prompting mass demonstrations. A report by an Organization of American States (OAS) electoral observation mission criticized the tally that showed Morales with an outright victory, saying it contradicted independent counts—though the credibility of this criticism has since been disputed by some independent analysts. A 2022 report by the US Department of State supported the conclusions of the OAS report.In November 2019, as protests, counterprotests, and accompanying violence intensified in the weeks following the October poll, Morales, vice president Álvaro García Linera, and the heads of the Senate and the lower chamber resigned, after Morales lost the support of the military and police forces. Days later, Jeanine Áñez Chavez, a senior senator and the highest-ranking official in the line of succession who had not yet resigned, was endorsed by the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal (TCP) to assume the presidency on an interim basis. Áñez indicated that she would only serve until a new election could be held, though in January 2020, she announced her candidacy for president in the next election. She eventually withdrew from the race in September 2020.An agreement between the interim government and the parliament, mediated by the United Nations, the European Union (EU), and the Roman Catholic Church, established a new election date and a new Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE). The election was supposed to be held in May 2020; however, it was postponed until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the October 2020 poll showed a clear victory for MAS candidate Luis Arce, who won over 55 percent of the vote, precluding the need for a runoff. Voter turnout was recorded at 84 percent. Multiple independent observer missions deemed the poll credible and fair, and competing parties and civil society stakeholders accepted the results.",4,"The Plurinational Legislative Assembly (ALP) consists of a 130-member Chamber of Deputies and a 36-member Senate. Legislative terms are five years. Due to allegations of irregularities in the 2019 general elections, the results of the vote for legislative representatives were considered invalid, and in November 2019, the ALP unanimously passed a law calling for new legislative elections to be held in October 2020. In those elections, the MAS won 75 of the 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 21 seats in the Senate. The Citizen Community party secured 39 seats in the lower house and 11 seats in the upper house, and the new We Believe (Creemos) alliance won 16 and 4 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, respectively.",4,"The final report of the OAS on the 2019 elections claimed that the elections’ overall results were not verifiable, due to “willful manipulation” abetted by a biased TSE. After Morales’s resignation in November 2019, the parliament agreed on a transparent formula to reconstitute an independent TSE in December of that year.In the 2020 elections, the TSE’s actions were widely considered independent and free from undue political influence. Though the day of the vote was postponed twice due to the coronavirus pandemic, the body nevertheless administered a safe vote with high turnout.For years, Bolivian politics were characterized by MAS efforts to abolish presidential term limits. In 2017, MAS lawmakers overturned the articles in the constitution setting presidential term limits by consulting the TCP, a body the lawmakers themselves had appointed, despite voters rejecting this measure by referendum in 2016. In June 2021, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) found that term limits do not violate rights protected by the American Convention on Human Rights.",2
bosnia-and-herzegovina,"The 1995 Dayton Accords that ended the war in BiH reorganized the state as including two autonomous entities—the Federation of BiH, whose residents are mainly Bosniak and Croat, and the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska (RS)—that operate under a weak central government. The position of head of state is held by a three-member presidency comprising one Bosniak, one Serb, and one Croat; they are each elected to a four-year term, which they serve concurrently.The chair of the Council of Ministers, or prime minister, is nominated by the presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. The chair in turn nominates other ministers for approval by the House.In October 2022, BiH held general elections. Denis Bećirović of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) defeated longtime Bosniak nationalist chief Bakir Izetbegović of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) for the Bosniak seat on the state presidency. Željko Komšić, leader of the multiethnic Democratic Front, defeated Borjana Krišto of the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH) for the Croat seat, but the HDZ BiH claimed his election was “illegitimate” on the grounds that Komšić’s support came in part from Bosniak voters, as in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina voters may choose to vote for either the Bosniak or Croat representative. (Komšić drew overall support from moderate Bosniak and Croat voters, rather than those in the HDZ BiH’s conservative strongholds.) The secessionist Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) from the Serb-dominated RS entity won the Serb seat on the state presidency, although the party’s leader, Milorad Dodik, opted not to seek reelection and instead ran for the presidency of the RS entity. Significant evidence of electoral fraud in RS elections prompted the Central Election Commission (CIK) to call for a recount of the entity’s presidential race. Dodik won the recount and was declared the president in late October, but the discovery of illegally printed ballots as well the large number of invalid ballots raises serious questions about the integrity of the vote and of the overall democratic process in BiH.An election-monitoring mission from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) assessed the polls as competitive but noted deficiencies in electoral framework, general distrust in government, unequal participation by women, concerns about the secrecy of votes, procedural irregularities during vote counting, and “limited and biased media coverage.” The mission noted that deepening ethnic segregation and “corresponding divergent views on the future of the country remain a concern for the functioning of democratic institutions.”",2,"The Parliamentary Assembly, a state-level body, has two chambers. The 15-seat upper house, the House of Peoples, consists of five members from each of the three main ethnic groups, elected by the Federation and RS legislatures for four-year terms. The lower house, the House of Representatives, has 42 popularly elected members serving four-year terms, with 28 seats assigned to representatives from the Federation and 14 to representatives from the RS. While the SDA, HDZ BiH, and SNSD dominated the October 2022 general elections, they faced significant competition from other parties, particularly the SDP. Polling took place concurrently with the presidential poll, and election monitors noted similar irregularities. Turnout was down 3 percent from the previous elections, to just above 50 percent. Less than an hour after polls closed, the High Representative, Christian Schmidt, moved to amend the Federation entity’s election law and constitution. While Schmidt said he intended to streamline government functionality and respect a Bosnian Constitutional Court ruling, he imposed the changes without offering an opportunity to the new entity parliament (in which moderate and reform-minded actors had increased their representation) to exercise its legislative powers to realize the relevant changes. Critics credibly alleged that Schmidt undermined the democratic integrity of BiH institutions; passed changes that appear to disproportionately favor the Croat nationalist HDZ BiH; and failed to adequately address the totality of the outstanding constitutional and electoral cases facing the Bosnian state.",2,"The CIK administers elections with the help of municipal election commissions. Both are subject to significant political party interference. The CIK is a largely ineffectual body, unable to act decisively without political support.Conflicts over fair ethnic representation surround aspects of the constitution and electoral laws. BiH citizens who do not identify as members of the country’s Bosniak, Serb, or Croat “constitutive peoples” remain barred from the presidency and membership in the House of Peoples, despite 2009 and 2016 rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) that the exclusion of members of other ethnic groups violated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).In July 2022, media reports emerged that High Representative Schmidt was going to amend the Federation entity’s election laws. After criticism and protests, Schmidt made only technical amendments. Those interventions, and the more substantial amendments he made in October, were presented primarily as streamlining government functionality in the Federation entity. The decision, however, was widely understood and implicitly acknowledged by the Office of the High Representative (OHR) itself as a way of implementing a Constitutional Court decision in the so-called Ljubić case, regarding participation by the three main ethnic groups in certain political races. The move sidestepped the newly elected parliament and was widely perceived as benefitting the HDZ BiH. Despite his claims, Schmidt’s changes have not led to prompt government formation in either the Federation entity or at the state level. ",1

brazil,"Brazil is a federal republic governed under a presidential system. The president is elected by popular vote for a four-year term and is eligible for reelection to a second consecutive term.In the 2022 race, the candidates appealed to voters concerned with economic difficulties and rising poverty levels. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the PT, who served as president from 2003 to 2011, and incumbent Jair Bolsonaro of the PL were the two leading candidates. Lula campaigned on economic concerns and social policy, while Bolsonaro’s campaign focused attention on evangelical support. The election was decided in a late October runoff, with Lula winning 50.9 percent of the vote and Bolsonaro earning 49.1 percent.The highly polarized campaign was marred by disinformation, aggressive rhetoric on social networks and online messaging services and political violence. Bolsonaro also said the country’s voting system was susceptible to fraud during the contest. As the second round was held, federal highway agents reportedly conducted traffic stops in several states, stopping buses carrying voters to polling stations. Bolsonaro did not explicitly concede after losing the election, initially remaining silent while his supporters blocked major roads and called for new elections and military intervention. In late November, Bolsonaro challenged the results in court, calling for some runoff results to be “invalidated” after the TSE ratified the vote. TSE chief Alexandre de Moraes, who is also a Supreme Court justice, rejected the case, saying the campaign acted in bad faith. In late December, a man was arrested for attempting to detonate a bomb near Brasília’s airport, telling police he was inspired by Bolsonaro’s rhetoric.

Bolsonaro again claimed that the country’s ballot system was vulnerable to fraud ahead of the 2022 elections, though no evidence has ever been found. The Defense Ministry inspected several hundred voting machines in October; while it found no irregularities, it did not publish its report until November. The report did not explicitly declare whether potential fraud was possible.In October 2022, the TSE gave de Moraes the unilateral authority to order the removal of online content that did not comply with previous TSE rulings, as part of an effort to combat disinformation.

However, alleged instances of voter intimidation and vote-buying by various groups, including by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) party, were reported; such irregularities are persistent in economically and socially vulnerable communities. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) election observation mission also reported the “massive” misuse of government resources by the incumbent Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) during the April 2021 elections.After the fall of the Petkov government in June 2022 and the dissolution of parliament in early August, President Radev called early elections for October 2, 2022. Election monitors found the polls generally free and fair, though OSCE observers noted that the president and the government he appointed played “a prominent part” in the electoral campaign by issuing several statements criticizing Petkov’s government.",4,"The Central Election Commission (CEC) administers Bulgaria’s elections and generally works professionally and impartially, though some flaws have been reported in past elections. In recent years, changes to the electoral framework have been introduced just ahead of elections with little opportunity for debate or public comment, some of which have had negative effects for electoral administration. In late 2022, the caretaker government moved rapidly to amend the electoral code to reintroduce paper ballots, prompting protests among citizens who argued that a shift away from digital voting machines could facilitate fraud.The OSCE, in its assessment of the October 2022 elections, noted that “several longstanding concerns” about the electoral process persisted, including “inconsistencies and ambiguous provisions” that negatively affected election administration and media coverage of the campaign.",3
burkina-faso,"Two separate military coups in 2022 restored military rule after nearly eight years of political reforms that had yielded democratic gains. In January, Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba led a military coup that ousted the democratically elected president, Roch Marc Christian Kaboré. Captain Ibrahim Traoré led the second coup in September, dismissing the transitional government set up by Damiba in March, suspending the constitution, and placing power in the military junta he had formed and led. Less than two weeks later, in October, the Traoré junta organized a national forum, during which Traoré was formally recognized as president. The forum also drafted a transitional charter which provided him with the authority to name a transitional government and legislate by decree until the naming of legislators.Traoré named Appollinaire Joachim Kyelem de Tambela as his prime minister to serve as head of a 23-member transitional government, which was created in late October.",0,"The two coups dissolved both the elected parliament and the subsequent transitional bodies. In November 2022, the Traoré-led junta and its national forum established a 71-member transitional legislature through the transitional charter. Twenty members of the legislature were chosen by Traoré. The rest were made up of 16 members from the security and defense forces; 13 civil society leaders who were not affiliated with a political movement; 12 members from political parties (4 from the former majority party, 4 from the former opposition, 2 from the unaffiliated opposition, and 2 from other parties); and 10 other members from civil society. The 20 members appointed by Traoré and the 16 from the security and defense forces make up a one-seat majority at 36 members. The charter cannot be revised without Traoré’s support and a two-thirds majority vote from the transitional legislature.

Ndayishimiye won 71.5 percent of the vote, while Agathon Rwasa of the National Congress for Liberty (CNL) received 25.2 percent, and Gaston Sindimwo of the Union for National Progress (UPRONA) received 1.7 percent. The contest was marred by a wide-ranging campaign of repression, which the UN Commission of Inquiry (CoI) on Burundi said included the intelligence services, police, and the Imbonerakure, the ruling party’s youth wing. International observers were barred from the polls. The CNL claimed that the results were fraudulent, though the Constitutional Court upheld them in June. Ndayishimiye was to take office that August but was inaugurated that June, after Nkurunziza died in office.The president appoints a vice president, who must be approved separately by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament. Prosper Bazombanza was named vice president in June 2020, while former public security minister Alain-Guillaume Bunyoni was named prime minister. In September 2022, President Ndayishimiye accused Bunyoni of planning a coup and removed him from office. Ndayishimiye then appointed former security minister Gervais Ndirakobuca as prime minister.

Rejected candidates were unable to appeal, and the government ignored an African Court of Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR) ruling to allow former prime minister Guillaume Soro and former president Laurent Gbagbo to run. Several leading opposition parties, including those of Soro and Gbagbo, refused to participate in the polls and called for boycotts and protests. The government banned public demonstrations throughout the election period, and those that occurred were met with violence. The campaign period itself was marred by instances of violence between progovernment and antigovernment supporters, resulting in dozens of deaths.The opposition boycotted the election outright, while many would-be voters were prevented from casting ballots due to security concerns. Ouattara won 94 percent of the vote on a turnout of 54 percent according to the government. These numbers were contested by independent observers from the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA), which reported that only 54 percent of polling stations opened and only 41 percent of voter cards were distributed before the polls. The EISA also voiced concerns over the comprehensiveness of electoral-roll data, noting that the roll included a large number of deceased individuals; claimed the election commission lacked transparency; and said the commission heavily favored the RHDP in administering the election.The prime minister is the head of government, is appointed by the president, and is responsible for designating a cabinet which is also approved by the president. Patrick Achi was appointed in 2021 following the death of former prime minister Hamed Bakayoko. Achi and his cabinet resigned in April 2022; Achi was reappointed that month to preside over a smaller group of ministers.",2,"The bicameral parliament consists of a 255-seat lower house, the National Assembly, and a 99-seat Senate, which was envisaged by the 2016 constitution and seated in 2018. National Assembly members are directly elected to five-year terms. Some 66 senators are indirectly elected by the National Assembly and members of various local councils, while the president appoints the other 33; all 99 serve five-year terms.A transparent, credible, and peaceful lower-house election was held in March 2021. Candidates from several opposition parties and coalitions, including most of those that had boycotted the October 2020 presidential elections, took part. However, the Soro-led Generations and People in Solidarity (GPS) party did not participate in either the presidential or the parliamentary elections. The RHDP won an absolute majority, taking 139 seats but suffering a net loss compared to its 167-seat contingent in the last parliament. An opposition coalition of the Democratic Party of Côte d’Ivoire–African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA) and the pro-Gbagbo Together for Democracy and Solidarity (EDS) won 80. Ten seats went to other party lists and groups, while 22 were won by independents. Despite the increased opposition participation and peaceful conduct of the polls, turnout remained low at 37.8 percent.",2,"In 2016, the ACHPR ruled that the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) was biased in favor of the government and ordered amendments to the electoral law. President Ouattara conceded to the CEI’s reorganization, increasing the number of civil society members in the CEI from four to six by parliamentary amendment in 2019. Civil society criticized the reforms, warning that the government would still exert influence due to its continued nominating powers, and changes that could make the body more independent were only partially implemented. Ruling party members were largely left to run the CEI due to staff changes, allegations of irregularities in appointment and other procedures, and opposition boycotts that affected district-level staffing.In April 2020, the government amended the electoral code by emergency executive ordinance—enabled via COVID-19 emergency measures—without consulting candidates. The updated electoral roll was opaque and regionally unbalanced; the CEI refused to report detailed data or submit to an independent audit. That July, the ACHPR ruled that Côte d’Ivoire must take steps to further reform the CEI, including the nominating process, to reduce potential government influence over nominations.The post-2016 changes have improved electoral competition, though the Ivorian electoral framework still contains weaknesses and dissatisfaction over recent reforms has persisted. Opposition groups have more recently participated in the CEI’s central commission after reforms allowed political parties with significant parliamentary representation to receive seats. Opposition candidates were also able to participate in the 2021 parliamentary elections without facing arbitrary rejection by electoral administration bodies.",2

cuba,"Under the 2019 constitution, the president and vice president of the republic are chosen to serve up to two five-year terms by the National Assembly. The prime minister and the Council of Ministers are designated by the National Assembly upon the president’s recommendation. In practice, these processes ratify candidates who have been preselected by the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC).Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez was elected president of the republic under the new constitutional system in a nearly unanimous National Assembly vote in October 2019. That December, he named Manuel Marrero Cruz prime minister. National Assembly president Juan Esteban Lazo Hernández became president of the Council of State, Cuba’s top executive office under the old constitution, in October 2019, succeeding Díaz-Canel.Raúl Castro Ruz, who preceded Díaz-Canel as president of the Council of State, continued to wield considerable power as PCC first secretary. However, Castro retired from that post during the April 2021 party congress and was succeeded by Díaz-Canel. Castro maintains significant influence despite his retirement.",0,"The unicameral National Assembly is directly elected to serve five-year terms, but a PCC-controlled commission designates all candidates, presenting voters with a single candidate for each seat. Those who receive more than 50 percent of the valid votes cast are deemed elected. The National Assembly in turn selects members of the Council of State, a body that exercises legislative power between the assembly’s two brief annual sessions. In the 2018 National Assembly elections, all 605 of the approved candidates were deemed elected. Elections for municipal assemblies held in November 2022 were marked by historically low voter turnout. The elections reportedly featured only one opposition candidate out of the more than 26,000 nominated, leading opposition groups to call for a boycott of the polls.",0,"The only Cuban elections that offer a choice of more than one candidate per office are those for municipal assemblies, but no campaigning is allowed. This did not change under the electoral law unanimously approved in 2019 following ratification of the new constitution, which retained the system of PCC-controlled electoral and candidacy commissions. However, the new law eliminated provincial assemblies, calling instead for municipal assemblies to approve provincial governors proposed by the president, and cut the number of National Assembly delegates to 474 as of the 2023 elections.",0
cyprus,"The president, who serves as both head of state and head of government, is elected by popular vote for up to two five-year terms. President Nicos Anastasiades of the center-right Democratic Rally (DISY) party won a second term with 56 percent of the vote in a 2018 runoff against Stavros Malas, who was backed by the left-wing Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL). The two had outpolled seven other candidates in the first round. International observers found that the overall election process adhered to democratic principles.The next presidential election was set for February 2023, and Anastasiades said he would not seek a third term, quieting a debate on whether a 2019 constitutional amendment imposing the two-term limit should apply retroactively.",4,"The unicameral House of Representatives has 80 seats filled through proportional representation in six multimember electoral districts. Members serve five-year terms. In practice, only 56 seats are occupied, as the 24 seats reserved for the Turkish Cypriot community have been left unfilled since Turkish Cypriot representatives withdrew from the chamber in 1964.In the 2021 legislative elections, which were held in accordance with international standards, DISY led the voting with 17 seats, down one from 2016, followed by AKEL with 15, also a one-seat decline. The centrist Democratic Party (DIKO) received nine seats, the far-right National Popular Front (ELAM) received four, the Movement for Social Democracy–Citizens’ Alliance (EDEK-SYPOL) also took four seats, and the Green Party (KOSP) secured three seats. The liberal centrist Democratic Alignment (DIPA) won parliamentary representation for the first time, receiving four seats.Also in 2021, the parliament voted to postpone that year’s municipal elections until the 2024 implementation of structural reforms that would, among other changes, reduce the number of municipalities. The incumbent municipal councils would remain in place while the reforms were pending.",4,"Electoral laws are generally fair. Voters may only cast ballots at their locality of residence, not in other parts of Cyprus, and from abroad under certain conditions.

The number of seats won by Isamaa and the Social Democrats dropped to 12 and 10, respectively.",4,"The legal framework for conducting elections is clear and fairly administered.

eswatini,"The king is the chief executive authority and is empowered to appoint and dismiss the prime minister and members of the cabinet. Mswati III took the throne in 1986, four years after the death of his father, King Sobhuza II. The prime minister is ostensibly the head of government but has little practical power. Cleopas Sipho Dlamini was appointed prime minister in July 2021, succeeding acting prime minister Themba Masuku, who temporarily held the position after former prime minister Ambrose Mandvulo Dlamini died of COVID-19 in 2020. Traditional chiefs govern their respective localities and typically report directly to the king. While some chiefs inherit their positions according to custom, others are appointed through royal interventions, as allowed by the constitution.",0,"The 73-member House of Assembly, the lower chamber of the bicameral Parliament, includes 59 members elected by popular vote within the tinkhundla system, which allows local chiefs to vet candidates and influence outcomes in practice; the king appoints 10 members. If female representation does not exceed 30 percent of the lower house, an additional four women may be elected by the body; parliamentarians did so in 2018. The king appoints 20 members of the 30-seat Senate, the upper chamber, with the remainder selected by the House of Assembly. All members of Parliament serve five-year terms. After the 2018 parliamentary elections, the king appointed six members of the royal family to the House of Assembly and eight to the Senate. The elections, which were tightly controlled and featured a slate of candidates almost entirely loyal to the king, did not offer voters a genuine choice.",0,"The Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC) is not considered impartial. It is financially and administratively dependent on the executive, and its members are appointed by the king on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), whose members are also royal appointees.

ethiopia,"The president is the head of state and is indirectly elected to a six-year term by both chambers of Parliament. The prime minister is head of government and is selected by the largest party in Parliament after elections, or in the case of a resignation. Following general elections in June and September 2021, Prime Minister Abiy’s Prosperity Party formed a new cabinet that included three opposition party members. In October, Abiy was sworn in for a new five-year mandate. Despite their landslide victory, the results were contested by political actors who were excluded or who did not participate in the process due to perceived unfairness.",1,"The bicameral Parliament includes the 153-seat House of Federation, whose members are elected by state assemblies to five-year terms, and the House of People’s Representatives, with 547 members directly elected to five-year terms. The June and September 2021 parliamentary and regional elections were seen as an opportunity for the country to break from its past of undemocratic elections. Changes in electoral laws and reform of the NEBE improved the body’s operations and encouraged far more opposition parties to participate than ever before. A total of 46 political parties participated in the elections, fielding 9,505 candidates. An estimated 37 million people registered to vote, and some 90 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. Final results from the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) confirmed a majority for the Prosperity Party, which won over 410 of 436 constituencies contested. Polls were indefinitely postponed in Tigray.Despite improvements, the elections were fraught with insecurity, registration problems, and other challenges that limited widespread acceptance of the outcomes as free and fair. Numerous political parties raised concerns about the closure of their offices by security agents, harassment, imprisonment, and killings of their members. In this context, key opposition groups boycotted the election, resulting in many uncontested seats. While more competitive than previous elections, the 2021 polls still fell short of conferring broad-based legitimacy to the elected government among significant political factions in the country.",1,"Several reforms to the electoral system and its oversight have taken shape under Prime Minister Abiy. Parliament unanimously passed the 2019 Ethiopian Election, Political Parties Registration, and Election Ethics law. The new legal framework reduced restrictions that had limited the participation of opposition groups and failed to recognize voting rights of marginalized sections of the population, such as international displaced persons (IDPs) and prisoners.Challenges that arose during the 2021 polls tested the impartiality and credibility of the NEBE and the broader electoral framework, including regarding the participation of imprisoned political candidates. One party, the Balderas for True Democracy, sought legal recourse to ensure imprisoned candidates were registered and succeeded when the Federal High Court directed the NEBE to allow the jailed candidates to participate. Electoral authorities initially resisted the court order, saying ballots had already been printed, but ultimately reprinted ballots to include the Balderas candidates. Similarly, several Oromo political parties filed their case to the court after being denied accreditation by the NEBE and the court ruled for them, though they did not participate in the election due to the lengthy court proceedings.The lack of a complete census, which was scheduled to be completed in 2017 but was repeatedly delayed due to security concerns, remains a major impediment to the demarcation of constituencies that ensure fair representation based on accurate population estimates. With the exception of the newly established Sidama regional state, the distribution of electoral constituencies has not changed from the original distribution established in 1995.",2
fiji,"The prime minister is the head of government. The party that wins the most seats in parliamentary elections selects the prime minister, who is then appointed by the president. In December 2022 parliamentary elections, the ruling FijiFirst Party and a coalition of two opposition parties, the PAP and the National Federation Party (NFP), each won 26 seats. The balance, 3 seats in the 55-member parliament, was won by the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA). After some equivocation, SODELPA decided to join the opposition coalition to form a government, the first that would not be led by Frank Bainimarama since he had taken power in a 2006 coup. Sitiveni Rabuka, head of the PAP, was elected by a secret ballot of members of parliament days later, 28 votes to 27. In an interim press statement before the conclusion of the count, the Multinational Observer Group reported that they “did not observe any significant irregularities or issues during pre-polling, postal voting or Election Day voting.” Opposition leaders had raised allegations of irregularities after a glitch in the official elections office app forced a pause in vote counting.The president is elected by Parliament for a three-year term and holds a largely ceremonial role. In October 2021, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere was elected president, replacing former president George Konrote.",3,"Parliament is Fiji’s unicameral legislative body, with 55 members elected to serve four-year terms. International observers of the 2018 and 2022 parliamentary elections found polling largely credible, although civil society participation was limited. The country uses an open list proportional representation system with a single, nationwide constituency; candidates are represented only by numbers on ballot papers.Municipal elections have not been held since 2005. Municipal councils were dissolved in 2009 and have since been run by government-appointed administrators.",2,"The legal framework for Fijian elections is considered fair. However, the structure of the electoral administration has raised concerns about potential political interference. Until December 2022, FijiFirst’s secretary general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, served as minister of elections as well as attorney general. A July 2021 decision by the Supervisor of Elections, Mohammed Saneem, removed opposition parliamentarian Niko Nawaikula from the voter registry on the grounds that he had not registered under his birth name. Nawaikula was forced to vacate his seat, but was reinstated in August by Fiji’s chief justice, who criticized Saneem for overextending his authority. Following Nawaikula’s reinstatement, the FijiFirst majority in Parliament passed an amendment to the Electoral Act in September 2021 requiring citizens to use the name “specified on the applicant’s birth certificate” on the voter registry. The opposition has expressed concern that the rule will disproportionately affect women voters whose birth names differ from their marital names. In December 2021, seven women brought a case before the High Court alleging discrimination against women occasioned by the amendment. The government that came to power in December 2022 promised to reverse this requirement.Other 2021 and 2022 amendments to the electoral law increase the powers of the Supervisor of Elections (SoE) significantly. The Law Council of Australia warned that the 2022 amendment gives the SoE ""extraordinarily broad information gathering powers without adequate safeguards or oversight mechanisms.”",2
finland,"The president, whose role is mainly ceremonial, is directly elected for up to two six-year terms.

The election was considered broadly free and fair.The prime minister, the head of government, is selected by Finland’s freely elected parliament. Following parliamentary elections in April 2019, Antti Rinne of the Social Democratic Party became prime minister in June.

The right-wing Finns Party placed second with 39 seats. The new government formed in June 2019 comprised the Social Democratic Party, the Center Party with 31 seats, the Green League with 20 seats, the Left Alliance with 16 seats, and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland with 9 seats.

gabon,"The president is elected by popular vote for seven-year terms. Presidential term limits were abolished in 2003. The August 2016 presidential election pitted incumbent Ali Bongo Ondimba of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) against Jean Ping of the opposition Union of Forces for Change (UFC). The electoral commission declared Bongo the winner with 49.8 percent of the vote. In Haut-Ogooué Province, a Bongo family stronghold, the commission claimed a turnout rate of 99.9 percent, with 95 percent for Bongo, even though turnout in the rest of Gabon was 54 percent. Both Ping and observers from the European Union called for a recount.Meanwhile, violent protests erupted, and security forces stormed Ping’s headquarters. Although the government claimed the death toll from the unrest was under 10 people, journalists and opposition leaders estimated that more than 50 had died; hundreds were arrested.The Constitutional Court, headed by a longtime Bongo family ally, rebuffed an observation mission from the African Union during the recount. Following the recount, the president was credited with 50.7 percent of the vote, which Ping rejected.Bongo suffered a stroke in 2018 and was not seen publicly for nearly a year.

Bongo appointed his share of senators in February 2021, days after the PDG claimed 45 of the body’s elected seats.National Assembly elections were originally due in 2016 but were repeatedly postponed. The incumbent lower house was finally dissolved in 2018, leaving the Senate as the only legislative body for most of that year. The PDG claimed 98 seats in the October 2018 National Assembly elections, which were boycotted by opposition parties due to the government’s failure to create an independent electoral commission. PDG allies won roughly 10 more seats, and no other party took more than 11. The elections were marked by credible allegations of fraud and repression.",0,"Gabon’s electoral laws and framework do not ensure credible elections. The electoral commission, the Interior Ministry, and the Constitutional Court all play important roles in managing elections, and all are loyal to Bongo. In 2018, Parliament gave its final approval to constitutional amendments that were developed without meaningful input from opposition parties or civil society. Those amendments introduced a runoff system for presidential elections if no candidate secures a first-round majority. Lawmakers rejected the imposition of presidential term limits. Under the 2020 constitutional amendments, the Senate’s size was reduced and the president was allowed to appoint 15 of its members. The amendments were regarded as a means of consolidating PDG control.The mandate of the members of the Gabonese Election Center (CGE), a body that organizes elections, was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Constitutional Court extending those mandates in June 2020. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and political parties later argued that the CGE was functioning illegally, however.

In December 2021, Adama Barrow won a second term with about 53 percent of the vote in a field of six candidates. Ousainou Darboe of the United Democratic Party (UDP) placed second with 28 percent. Domestic and international observers found the results to be credible. However, some irregularities were reported, and a number of deficiencies in the legal framework affected the campaign environment.

georgia,"The prime minister serves as head of government and the president serves as head of state. Under constitutional changes approved in 2017, the president elected in 2018 is to serve a six-year term, after which a 300-member electoral college comprising national lawmakers and regional and local officials will choose presidents.In 2018, Salome Zourabichvili, a former foreign minister supported by the Georgian Dream (GD) party, won about 60 percent of the vote in the second round of the presidential election, defeating Grigol Vashadze, a former foreign minister running for the opposition United National Movement (UNM). While the electoral environment was largely peaceful, significant preelectoral issues and voter intimidation on election day marred the quality of the runoff. Abuse of administrative resources and limited instances of vote buying and ballot-box stuffing were reported. GD activists created an intimidating atmosphere outside many voting stations. Just days before the runoff, a charitable foundation controlled by former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, then the GD chairman, promised to write off the debts of about one in six eligible voters. In 2022, the International Society for Fair Elections And Democracy (ISFED) and the Georgian branch of Transparency International (TI), citing documents provided by the former deputy director of the State Security Service of Georgia, accused GD of illegal offering pardons and improperly pressuring state employees to the degree that it may have influenced the outcome of the 2018 presidential election and the 2020 parliamentary elections.The president formally appoints the prime minister, whom Parliament nominates.

All members serve four-year terms.In the October 2020 parliamentary elections and November runoffs, GD won 90 seats, including all 30 single-member district seats. The UNM-led coalition won 36 seats, all via proportional representation, and 7 smaller groups won the remaining seats. Opposition parties boycotted the runoff, and voter turnout for that election round stood at 26 percent, the lowest recorded since independence. Opposition members who were elected declined to take their seats until an agreement between the government and opposition was brokered with the support of European Council (EC) president Charles Michel in April 2021. GD withdrew from the agreement in July 2021, however. By the end of 2022 most politicians had taken their seats. Election observers including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) considered the October 2020 vote competitive but noted numerous shortcomings, including ruling-party dominance in election commissions; voting stations crowded by party-affiliated observer groups, mostly linked to GD; campaign-finance rules that disadvantaged new and small parties; and highly polarized and nonanalytic media coverage. Additional claims of electoral malpractice benefitting the GD in the 2020 elections emerged in 2022 via a leak of documents from the former deputy director of the State Security Service.",2,"The country’s electoral laws are generally fair, and the bodies that implement them have typically done so impartially. However, GD’s dominance in precinct-level commissions has complicated complaints procedures, and short timelines for filing complaints impair election quality.New candidates for the Central Election Commission (CEC) were presented to parliament in August 2022, but at year’s end lawmakers had failed to vote on their candidacy, in violation of legally defined timeframes.",3

Scholz, of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), leads a coalition government composed of three parties: the SPD, the Green Party, and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP).",4,"The parliament includes a lower house (Bundestag), and an upper house, the 69-seat Federal Council (Bundesrat), which represents the country’s 16 federal states. The Bundestag is elected at least every four years through a mixture of proportional representation and single-member districts. The 2021 elections were competitive and deemed free and fair by local and international election monitors.In the 2021 elections, the SPD won 206 seats, gaining a narrow majority over the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). The CDU–CSU won 196 seats—a nearly 9 percent decline from the 2017 elections, and the party’s worst result since 1949. The Greens won a record 118 seats, and the FDP won 92; following the elections, both parties entered a coalition government with the SPD. The right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) took 83 seats, and the far-left party the Left, widely viewed as a successor to the East German communists, took 39. One representative from the Danish minority party South Schleswig Voters’ Committee (SSW) also entered the Bundestag.In Germany’s federal system, state governments have authority over matters such as education, policing, taxation, and spending. State governments appoint Bundesrat members, and in this manner can influence national policies.",4,"Germany’s electoral laws and framework are fair and impartial. German voters cast two ballots—one for a candidate in their constituency and another for a party, with the latter vote determining the seat share a party receives in the Bundestag. If a party wins more seats in the first vote than are permitted by results of the second, it gets to keep these “overhang seats”—yet to avoid distorting the results of the second vote, all other parties receive “balance seats.” With 736 lower-house members, Germany has the world’s second-largest national parliament, after China. To curtail the increasing size of the Bundestag, its members voted to adopt a two-step electoral reform in October 2020. The first step took effect ahead of the 2021 elections and includes a requirement that one party must gain more than three overhang seats for balance seats to be allocated to the other parties. The second step will reduce the number of constituencies, lowering the number of candidates able to win overhang seats in future elections.",4

African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) observers called the contest well-organized and generally peaceful, though EU monitors criticized a lack of campaign finance regulation and a misuse of state resources. Mahama rejected the results, alleging fraud, and issued a legal challenge.

In general, electoral laws are enacted through broad consultations with parties and the legislature and are implemented fairly by the EC. While AU electoral observers lauded the registration process and the EC’s overall performance during the 2020 elections, the EC agreed to enact reforms, including the introduction of continuous voter registration. In August 2022, the EC announced that voters will be required to present a National Identification Card (GhanaCard) to register to vote in the upcoming 2024 elections, in order to prevent ineligible people from being able to vote.

The junta that seized power in September 2021 suspended the constitution and the Independent National Electoral Commission. The transitional charter does not specify when new elections will be held. In the wake of the coup, Guinea’s ambassador to the United Nations stated that the junta would revise the voter roll ahead of elections. A decree from the interim president transferred responsibility for managing elections and referendums to the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization. In October 2022, the government agreed to limit the transition period to two years beginning in January 2023. The CNT has yet to start deliberating on a new electoral framework or to decide whether to maintain the previous framework.",0
guinea-bissau,"The president is elected through a two-round voting system for up to two consecutive terms of five years. The prime minister is appointed by the president “in accordance with the election results” after consulting with the parliamentary parties, and the government must be dissolved if the parliament rejects its proposed budget. Umaro Sissoco Embaló of the Movement for Democratic Alternation (Madem G15) party and a coalition of opposition parties, won the December 2019 presidential election’s runoff with 53.6 percent of the vote, defeating Domingos Simões Pereira of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde (PAIGC), who won 46.4 percent of the vote. According to the National Election Commission (CNE), voter turnout was 72.7 percent. The African Union’s (AU) election observation mission found that the administration of the runoff vote was free and transparent, despite challenges with the first round of voting. International bodies such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) acknowledged Embaló’s victory in April 2020. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected an appeal by Pereira that September.In February 2022, a group of armed men opened fire on the government palace, where the president was holding a cabinet meeting. The president went unharmed by the assailants, and remained in power following the incident, which has been labeled an attempted coup. Embaló has called the attack an assassination attempt, and claimed it was planned by drug traffickers. Several people arrested in connection with the attack remained awaiting trial at year’s end.",2,"Members of the 102-seat National People’s Assembly are elected by popular vote for four-year terms.

An interim government was appointed in June; the PAIGC, which could not reach an agreement with Embaló on taking part in a national unity executive, was excluded from the transitional government. New parliamentary elections were initially planned for December, but were later postponed until June 2023.",3,"There are some problems with the country’s electoral laws and framework, including weak controls on campaign spending, vote buying, and a lack of legal provisions for domestic poll observers.

European Union (EU) observers said the campaign was competitive and generally free, although polarization, unregulated campaign finance, and a lack of transparency characterized the preelectoral period. The EU observers said the poll’s integrity was “seriously compromised” by the manipulation of results by senior Guyana Elections Commission (GECOM) officials. The eventual allocation of seats was based on a recount approved by Caribbean Community observers.",3,"Although observers characterized the 2020 polls as generally free, EU observers described GECOM as dysfunctional, polarized, opaque, and derelict in its duty to stop its officials from interfering with the results.

haiti,"In Haiti’s semipresidential system, the president is directly elected for a five-year term. The prime minister is appointed by the president and confirmed by Parliament. Jovenel Moïse of the Haitian Tèt Kale Party (PHTK), the handpicked successor of then president Michel Martelly, won the 2015 presidential election, but the results were nullified due to extensive fraud. Moïse went on to win a repeat election in 2016, taking 55.6 percent of the vote. The events surrounding the repeat election later resulted in a political and legal dispute over whether Moïse’s term expired in February 2021, five years after the end of Martelly’s term, or February 2022, five years after Moïse was inaugurated.Moïse frequently replaced the prime minister during his tenure, but after the terms of most lawmakers expired in early 2020, his appointees were unable to obtain parliamentary approval in keeping with the constitution. After Prime Minister Claude Joseph submitted his resignation in early July 2021, Moïse appointed Ariel Henry as Joseph’s successor through a decree published in the official state newspaper Le Moniteur.Henry had not yet been installed when, days later, Moïse was assassinated at his residence. The assassination set off a dispute among local political, civic, and economic actors as to who should head the executive branch, but key diplomatic representatives in the country—known as the Core Group—called on Henry to lead the government, and Joseph stepped down. That September, Henry dismissed the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) and postponed already-overdue general elections. Although his role as head of government is contested due to his suspected involvement in Moïse’s assassination, Henry rules with support from the international community; the UN Security Council accepted Henry’s decision to postpone elections and dismiss the CEP in 2021. Polls may take place in 2023 under an agreement reached between Henry and civil society actors in December 2022.",1,"The directly elected, bicameral Parliament is composed of a Senate, with 30 members who serve six-year terms, and a Chamber of Deputies, with 119 members who serve four-year terms. The 2015 legislative elections were plagued by disorder, fraud, and violence; runoff polls held in 2016 were marred by fraud and low turnout. The PHTK emerged as the single largest party in both chambers, followed by Vérité (Truth).Parliament was dissolved in 2020 after parliamentary and local elections were cancelled in late 2019. The 10 senators who still had mandates supported Senate president Joseph Lambert’s short-lived bid to serve as acting president after Moïse’s assassination. The remaining senators’ mandates will expire in January 2023. Local government officials also operate without a mandate, with mayors being reappointed or leaving office in 2020.",0,"The CEP was established in the late 1980s as a temporary body but remains responsible for managing the electoral process. Despite constitutional safeguards against executive dominance of the CEP, the executive has asserted significant control in practice. In 2020, Moïse appointed a new CEP by presidential decree in a move that human rights observers called unconstitutional. Plans to hold a constitutional referendum and elections in 2021 were scuttled that September; Henry dismissed the CEP and pledged to assemble a new council with broader legitimacy. A new CEP was not formed in 2022, however.In 2021, political and civil society leaders produced the Montana Accord, under which a transitional government would preside over new polls. The accord did not win the immediate support of the PHTK and other stakeholders, however. In late December 2022, Henry signed on to a document with a different group of civil society and business actors. That agreement envisioned a 14-month transition period, 2023 polls, and the 2024 installation of a democratically elected government. A copy of that agreement was not published in Le Moniteur by year’s end.",2

The leading candidate need only win a plurality; there is no runoff.Following severe irregularities in the 2017 presidential election, the National Congress created two new electoral bodies in 2019: the Electoral Court of Justice (TJE) and National Electoral Council (CNE).In November 2021—and in the first presidential contest administered by the TJE and CNE—Xiomara Castro of Libre was elected with 51.1 percent of the vote, ending 12 years of PN executive control. Castro defeated then Tegucigalpa mayor Nasry Asfura of the PN. European Union election monitors lauded that year’s electoral reforms, which allowed for increased transparency and confidence, but noted that severe problems remained.

The Christian Democratic Party and the Anticorruption Party (PAC) each won 1.

hungary,"The National Assembly elects both the president and the prime minister, meaning the democratic legitimacy of these votes rests largely on the fairness of parliamentary elections. The president’s duties are mainly ceremonial, but they may influence appointments and return legislation for further consideration before signing it into law. The president is limited to a maximum of two terms.The April 2022 parliamentary elections were deemed severely flawed by observer missions, which noted that the rules were administered to advantage the Fidesz-KDNP ruling coalition. Fidesz elected Katalin Novák, a former minister and parliamentarian, as the first woman to be president of Hungary.The prime minister holds most executive power. Viktor Orbán has been prime minister since 2010, winning reelection for a third time in the flawed 2022 elections.",2,"Voters elect representatives every four years to a 199-seat, unicameral National Assembly under a mixed system of proportional and direct representation (106 from single-member districts and 93 from compensatory party lists). The Fidesz-KDNP coalition won the April 2022 parliamentary elections with 54.13 percent of the vote, securing a fourth consecutive term and a two-thirds majority with 135 seats. The coalition of opposition parties, United for Hungary, took 57 seats, and the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazánk) won 6 seats.An election observation mission performed by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) found that the elections were well organized and professionally managed, but they failed to provide a level playing field and equality of opportunities among candidates. Significant media bias towards ruling parties and the misuse of state resources hindered voters’ ability to make informed choices. Public media allowed only five minutes for the opposition coalition, formed by six parties, to present its program. The OSCE/ODIHR report emphasized the lack of effective legal remedy against irregularities and possible electoral fraud, as electoral authorities ruled mostly in favor of the Fidesz-KDNP, and noted several legal changes passed in recent years that may have impacted the election’s outcome. For example, November 2021 electoral reforms enabled voters to register in districts they do not live, paving the way for possible voter tourism. Electoral authorities denied investigation into partially burned ballots found in Romania by referring to their lack of extraterritorial jurisdiction.Human Rights Watch (HRW) found that the government misused personal data in several ways to disseminate Fidesz campaign messages. Warning of foreign intervention, the government also invited government-friendly election observers to legitimize the polls. Civil society organizations (CSOs) documented a series of attempts at electoral fraud, and independent media revealed evidence that postal ballots in Romania and Serbia were potentially tampered with by Fidesz allies. ",2,"The electoral framework that was established by the Fidesz-KDNP majority has been amended regularly based on the political interest of the ruling coalition, and since 2010 Fidesz has redrawn constituency boundaries in its favor.Electoral authorities are not independent. Members of the National Election Commission (NVB) are nominated by the president and confirmed to nine-year terms by the parliament. There is no formal parliamentary debate or public consultation process to inform the selection of NVB members, and observers have raised concerns about the body’s impartiality. However, because of the OSCE mission and more than 27,000 volunteers mobilized by civil society organizations, there was likely no fraud on election day in April 2022.In recent years, Orbán’s government has been largely successful in superseding impartiality requirements. Voters living outside Hungary are not guaranteed the ability to vote, and national minority voters have long faced systemic challenges in exercising their right to vote.",3
iceland,"The president serves as a largely ceremonial chief of state, is directly elected to a four-year term, and is not subject to term limits. President Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson was reelected in June 2020 with 92.2 percent of the vote. The prime minister is the head of government. The leader of the ruling party or coalition usually becomes prime minister; the legitimacy of the prime minister rests primarily on the conduct of the parliamentary polls. The current prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir of the Left-Green Movement (LGM), first took office in 2017.

After several weeks of negotiations, the parties agreed to renew their coalition. The elections were generally considered free and fair, but were marked by procedural irregularities. In the country’s northwest electoral district, extremely close results led to a recount the day after the election, resulting in five candidates—whose electoral victories had been announced earlier that day—losing their seats to other candidates from the same parties. The legality of the recount came into question after flaws in the district’s vote counting process were discovered, including the officials’ failure to seal the ballots following the initial count. Parliament confirmed the validity of the recount in November.Municipal elections were held in May 2022 and saw a voter turnout of 63 percent nationwide.",4,"The constitution, the election law of 2000, and related legislation establish a clear and detailed framework for conducting elections.

Narendra Modi was sworn in for a second term as prime minister after the BJP’s victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The president, who plays a largely symbolic role, is chosen for a five-year term by state and national lawmakers.

In March, the BJP retained control of the state assemblies in Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh, while the AAP won in Punjab. In December, the INC won in Himachal Pradesh, defeating the BJP. The BJP maintained control of Gujarat that same month.

iran,"The supreme leader, who has no fixed term, is the highest authority in the country. He is the commander in chief of the armed forces and appoints the head of the judiciary, the heads of state broadcast media, and the Expediency Council—a body tasked with mediating disputes between the Guardian Council and the parliament. He also appoints six members of the Guardian Council; the other six are jurists nominated by the head of the judiciary and confirmed by the parliament, all for six-year terms. The supreme leader is appointed by the Assembly of Experts, which monitors his work. However, in practice his decisions appear to go unchallenged by the assembly, whose proceedings are kept confidential. The current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, succeeded Islamic Republic founder Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. The president, the second-highest-ranking official in the Islamic Republic, appoints a cabinet that must be confirmed by the parliament. He is elected by popular vote for up to two consecutive four-year terms. Ebrahim Raisi, then head of the judiciary, won the presidency in June 2021 with 62 percent of the vote in a heavily manipulated contest. The Guardian Council had rejected most of the nearly 600 aspiring candidates—including 40 women—in May 2021, approving only seven applicants. Among those rejected were outgoing first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri, a reformist, and former parliament speaker Ali Larijani, a conservative. Three approved candidates dropped out several days before the poll.The election was also affected by official pressure on the media, with journalists told to refrain from issuing reports that were critical of the balloting or Raisi. Voter turnout, at just 48.8 percent, was the lowest for a presidential election in the Islamic Republic’s history.",0,"Members of the 290-seat parliament are elected to four-year terms. Elections for the body were held in 2020, with most seats going to hard-liners and conservatives loyal to the supreme leader. Ahead of the vote, the Guardian Council disqualified more than 9,000 of the 16,000 people who had registered to run, including large numbers of reformist and moderate candidates. Voter turnout, the lowest for parliamentary elections in the history of the Islamic Republic at 42.6 percent, was likely depressed by factors including the mass disqualifications and the announcement of the first COVID-19 cases just two days before the balloting. The outbreak was believed to have begun weeks earlier, raising suspicions that the authorities delayed disclosing it for political reasons; Khamenei denounced foreign “propaganda” for supposedly exaggerating the health threat to frighten voters.Elections for the Assembly of Experts, a group of 86 clerics chosen by popular vote to serve eight-year terms, were last held in 2016. Only 20 percent of the would-be candidates were approved to run, a record low. A majority of the new assembly ultimately chose hard-line cleric Ahmad Jannati, head of the Guardian Council, as the body’s chairman. Jannati was reelected to the Assembly of Experts’ chairmanship in 2021.

The Guardian Council, controlled by hard-line conservatives and ultimately by the supreme leader, vets all candidates for the parliament, the presidency, and the Assembly of Experts. The council typically rejects candidates who are not considered insiders or deemed fully loyal to the clerical establishment, as well as women seeking to run in the presidential election. As a result, Iranian voters are given a strictly limited choice of candidates.",1
iraq,"After national elections, the Council of Representatives (CoR) chooses the largely ceremonial president, traditionally Kurdish, who in turn appoints a prime minister, traditionally Shia, nominated by the largest bloc in the parliament. The prime minister, who holds most executive power and forms the government, serves up to two four-year terms. In October 2022, after a year-long political paralysis, Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani and his government, supported by the pro-Iran Coordination Framework, were approved by the parliament. Earlier that month, the KDP–aligned candidate, Abdul Latif Rashid, was elected as president.The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), composed of Iraq’s northernmost provinces, is ostensibly led by a president with extensive executive powers, but former long-term KRG president, Masoud Barzani, maintains significant political influence. In 2019, Nechirvan Barzani, Masoud’s brother, was elected president by the Iraqi Kurdish parliament after the position had been vacant for nearly two years. Masrour Barzani, Masoud’s son, was appointed and sworn in as prime minister the same month. Both Barzanis, the current president and prime minister, are members of the KDP.",2,"The 329 members of the CoR are elected every four years from multimember open lists in each province. The October 2021 parliamentary elections were generally viewed as credible by international observers, despite documented cases of voter and candidate intimidation, bribing of voters, journalists being prevented from covering the voting, arrests of activists calling for an election boycott, and the lowest voter turnout since the end of the Saddam Hussein regime. In June 2022, following the resignation of the 73 Sadrist parliamentarians at the order of al-Sadr, the CoR swore in 64 new parliamentarians, leaving nine seats vacant. The new parliamentarians were the runners-up in their districts in the 2021 elections and gave the pro-Iranian bloc, the Coordination Framework, 40 more seats, for a total of 130. The opposition parties affiliated with the 2019 protest movement, Imtidad and Ishraqat Kanoon, gained 7 and 1 seats respectively.In August 2022, protests in Baghdad led by Sadrists in response to the 10-month political crisis turned into violent clashes with pro-Iran militias that resulted in the deaths of 22 people. Thereafter, al-Sadr called for his supporters to disperse, which paved the way for the formation of a government in October.In Iraqi Kurdistan, the 111-seat Kurdish parliament is elected through closed party-list proportional representation in a single district, with members serving four-year terms. Since the 2018 elections, the governing KDP has maintained a plurality of seats, followed by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Gorran movement. The elections were plagued by fraud allegations and other irregularities, and Gorran and other smaller parties rejected the results. Political disputes between the KDP and PUK concerning the formation of the electoral committee led to the cancelation of the October 2022 Kurdish parliamentary elections; no subsequent date had been set as of year-end.",3,"The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) is responsible for managing elections. The IHEC generally enjoys the confidence of the international community and, according to some polls, the Iraqi public.

israel,"A largely ceremonial president is elected by the Knesset (parliament) for one seven-year term. In June 2021, Isaac Herzog, formerly the head of the Labor Party, was elected to replace outgoing president Reuven Rivlin. The prime minister must have the support of a majority in the Knesset. In 2014, in a bid to create more stable governing coalitions, the electoral threshold for parties to win representation was raised from 2 percent to 3.25 percent, and the no-confidence procedure was revised so that opponents hoping to oust a sitting government must simultaneously vote in a new one. Despite this change, there are still many small parties in the political system, making it difficult to form majorities.After the March 2021 elections, parties from across the political spectrum formed a new coalition government, ending the premiership of Likud’s Benjamin Netanyahu. According to the coalition agreement, Naftali Bennett of the right-wing Yamina Party would serve as prime minister for about two years, after which Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid would replace him until the next elections. In June 2022, Bennett and Lapid announced that their governing coalition had collapsed and the Knesset would be dissolved; Lapid was appointed interim prime minister until a new government could be formed following snap elections in November. Netanyahu returned as prime minster in December as head of the most right-wing government in Israeli history after successfully forming a new governing coalition.

The right-wing nationalist bloc headed by Netanyahu was able to secure a plurality of seats following the elections: Netanyahu’s Likud took 32 seats, while the far-right Religious Zionist party took 14 seats, and ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism took 11 and 7 seats, respectively. Yesh Atid took 24 seats, the centrist National Unity won 12, Israel is our Home won 6, the Islamist Ra’am and the Arab-led Joint List won 5 seats each, and the center-left Labor Party won 4.

italy,"Parliament and regional representatives elect the president, whose role is largely ceremonial but sometimes politically influential, for a seven-year term. The legitimacy of the presidential vote rests largely on the fairness of legislative elections. Sergio Mattarella, a former constitutional judge, was reelected president with strong backing in January 2022 after support failed to coalesce around a successor in the seven previous rounds of voting.The president appoints the prime minister, who serves as head of government and is often, but not always, the leader of the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, Italy’s lower house. The prime minister proposes a Council of Ministers that requires confirmation by parliament.In July 2022, the national unity government formed in January 2021 and led by Draghi—the third government formed following the 2018 elections—collapsed after three of Draghi’s main coalition partners boycotted a confidence vote he had called. Draghi resigned following the boycotted vote, and Mattarella dissolved parliament and called for snap national elections, which were held in September. Georgia Meloni of the far-right Brothers of Italy party was sworn in as prime minister in October, after her right-wing alliance took control of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies in the September elections. The coalition government includes Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right Forward Italy (Forza Italia) in addition to the Brothers of Italy.",4,"The bicameral parliament consists of the 400-member Chamber of Deputies and the 200-member Senate. The September 2022 snap elections were the first that incorporated a drastic reduction in the number of parliamentary seats—down from 630 in the Chamber of Deputies and 315 in the Senate—that voters had approved in a 2020 referendum. Members of both houses are popularly elected for five-year terms, though the president can appoint five additional senators, and former presidents are also entitled to Senate seats.The September 2022 elections were considered free and fair by international observers. The right-wing coalition led by Meloni won the largest share of the vote for both houses.",4,"While Italy’s electoral framework and campaign finance regulations are complex, the elections they enable have consistently been deemed fair and credible.The current electoral law, adopted by parliament in 2017, introduced a mixed system in both houses, with 36 percent of seats allocated using the first-past-the-post method, and 64 percent using a proportional, party-list method. The law encouraged coalition governments, as demonstrated by the 2018 and 2022 election results. In the 2022 elections, 18-year-old voters were able to take part in the election of senators as well as members of the Chamber of Deputies for the first time, in accord with a 2021 constitutional amendment reducing the legal voting age for Senate elections, which had previously been 25.",4

Japan’s emperor serves as head of state in a ceremonial capacity.In September 2021, following the resignation of Yoshihide Suga, the LDP chose Fumio Kishida as its new leader, and the parliament voted to confirm him as prime minister a few days later. Kishida won a fresh mandate from lawmakers in November of that year, following the October parliamentary elections.",4,"The parliament, or Diet, has two chambers. The more powerful lower house, the House of Representatives, has 465 members elected to maximum four-year terms through a mixture of single-member districts and proportional representation. The upper house, the House of Councillors, has 248 members serving fixed six-year terms, with half elected every three years using a mixture of nationwide proportional representation and prefecture-based voting. The prime minister and his cabinet can dissolve the lower house, but not the upper house. The lower house can also pass a no-confidence resolution that forces the cabinet to either resign or dissolve the lower house.Legislative elections in Japan are free and fair. In the October 2021 lower house elections, the LDP won 259 seats, and its coalition partner, Komeito, took 32. Some independents later joined the LDP, adding to its majority. The largest opposition group, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), won 96 seats, and smaller parties and independents captured the remainder.In the July 2022 upper house elections, the LDP and Komeito won 76 seats out of the 125 contested, giving them a majority of 146 seats in the chamber.

Campaigning is heavily regulated, which typically benefits incumbents, although the rules are applied equally to all candidates.Malapportionment in favor of the rural districts from which the LDP draws significant support has been a persistent problem, despite a series of reforms to reduce the disparity with urban districts. Three members were added to the upper house in 2022 as part of the reform effort. After courts ruled that the level of malapportionment in the 2021 lower house elections had been “in a state of unconstitutionality,” the Diet adopted legislation in November 2022 to revise boundaries for as many as 140 districts, with the aim of keeping the disparity between the most and least populated districts below a two-to-one ratio.",4

The lower house, the 130-seat House of Representatives, is elected for four-year terms. Its members win office through races in 23 multimember districts, with 15 seats reserved for the leading women candidates who failed to capture district seats. Twelve seats are reserved for religious and ethnic minorities.The royal court announced its intention to trigger an election in a July 2020 statement, and Abdullah II dissolved the parliament in late September. However, uncertainty over the early-November polling date amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic prompted some candidates to delay campaign efforts. International observers, who regularly monitor parliamentary elections, were largely absent.Independents, many of whom were tribal figures and businesspeople considered loyal to the monarchy, won most seats. The main opposition group, the Islamic Action Front (IAF), the Islah Alliance, and the Muslim Center Party each won 5 seats. Voter turnout stood at 30 percent. Vote buying became more common during the 2020 contest, partially due to the dire economic situation caused by the pandemic.Elections for mayors, local and municipal councils, and 12 new governorate councils were held in March 2022. Voter turnout was just under 30 percent and the IAF boycotted the polls. The elections were dominated by local tribal politics; only 74 candidates formally announced affiliations to political parties. Al-Hayat Centre for Civil Society Development, a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), reported that a heavy security presence throughout the kingdom on election day compromised the secrecy of ballots. Violence broke out at 10 municipalities after the polling centers closed.",1,"Elections are administered by the Independent Election Commission (IEC), which generally receives positive reviews from international monitors in terms of technical management, though irregularities continue to be reported. However, IEC members are appointed by royal decree.The 2016 electoral-law reform introduced multiple-vote proportional representation for parliamentary elections, replacing a single nontransferable vote system that favored progovernment businesspeople and tribal elites over opposition-oriented political parties. The new law also redrew district lines to mitigate acute malapportionment that has long placed urban voters at a severe disadvantage. However even after these changes, rural and tribal voters making up the regime’s support base, remain heavily overrepresented.The legal framework for elections is unstable. Major changes are often introduced weeks before polling day, hindering campaign efforts. Candidate registration is reportedly easier in some progovernment areas. A new national electoral law passed in April 2022 lowered the eligibility age for candidates to 25 years old and increased the required proportion of women on party lists.",1
kazakhstan,"According to the constitution, the president, who holds most executive power, is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. Former president Nazarbaev maintained special constitutional powers through his status as Kazakhstan’s “first president,” which exempted him from term limits and made him chairman of the Security Council for life. In January 2022, following widespread violence alleged to have been instigated by supporters of Nazarbaev, President Toqaev removed Nazarbaev’s constitutional privileges and position. In June, a successful nationwide referendum removed the law giving Nazarbaev special status.President Toqaev was reelected in November 2022, in a snap vote before the end of his term, taking 81.3 percent of the vote according to the election commission. He faced five other candidates, none of whom were considered serious contenders. The OSCE election observation mission found that the election was neither free nor fair and was “not fully consistent with international standards and OSCE commitments for democratic elections.” Critics also claimed Toqaev was using the same election manipulation tactics as his predecessor.",0,"The upper house of the bicameral Parliament is the Senate. Under new constitutional rules passed in the June 2022 referendum, which expanded the Senate to 54 seats, 44 senators are chosen by the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan and 10 are appointed by the president. The senators, who are officially nonpartisan, serve six-year terms, with half of the elected members up for reelection every three years. The lower house, the Majilis, under the new constitutional rules features 98 members, 30 percent of which are elected according to a majoritarian system and the rest elected by proportional representation on party lists. Members serve five-year terms.Recent legislative elections have not met democratic standards. Irregularities including ballot-box stuffing, group and proxy voting, and manipulation of voter lists have been reported, and the ruling party benefits from a blurred distinction between the party and the state. Parliamentary elections held in January 2021 largely replicated the results of the previous election in 2016, with President Toqaev’s party, Amanat, taking 76 of the 98 elected seats. Though official data showed Amanat winning 71.09 percent of the popular vote, a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) reported that they party had actually only won 48.30 percent of the vote. Aq Jol and the Communist People’s Party, which are both considered loyal to the government, secured 12 and 10 seats, respectively. The only genuine opposition party, the National Social Democratic Party (OSDP), boycotted the elections.",0,"Kazakhstan’s legal framework is not sufficient to ensure free and fair elections, and safeguards that do exist are not properly enforced. Electoral laws make it difficult for opposition parties to obtain parliamentary representation. Parties must clear a 5 percent vote threshold to enter the Majilis and are barred from forming electoral blocs, preventing them from pooling votes and campaign resources. Presidential candidates must also pass a Kazakh language test with unclear evaluation criteria, have at least five years of experience of public service, and submit their medical records.

kenya,"The president and deputy president, who can serve up to two five-year terms, are directly elected by majority vote, and are required to win 25 percent of the votes in at least half of Kenya’s 47 counties.Despite weeks of polls predicting a win for longtime opposition leader Raila Odinga, who had been endorsed by incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta, then deputy president William Ruto was elected president in August 2022 with 50.49 percent of the vote, narrowly avoiding a runoff. Though the results were supported by parallel vote tabulation, Odinga and his supporters filed a petition with the Supreme Court shortly after the election seeking to nullify the results, alleging that foreigners had obtained unauthorized access to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC)’s digital system, and results forms had been altered. In September, the Supreme Court rejected the petitioners’ claims and unanimously upheld the election results. The election was widely seen as Kenya’s most transparent and technologically advanced to date. The IEBC employed biometric voter identification kits, and uploaded results forms to a public online portal, with more than 90 percent uploaded within a day of the election. Both candidates urged their supporters to remain peaceful and committed to respecting the outcome of the court challenge.Nevertheless, there were reports of irregularities and instances of intimidation and violence, including the abduction and murder of an election official. Youth in some areas reported being hired to disrupt rival campaigns. Youth voter registration lagged behind previous years, and some polling stations reported problems with biometric voter identification kits and incorrect usage of the backup manual register.",3,"The bicameral Parliament consists of the 349-seat National Assembly and the 67-seat Senate.

Both houses have speakers who are ex-officio members.In the August 2022 elections, Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza coalition secured a one-seat advantage in the Senate, while Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja coalition won a one-seat lead in the National Assembly. Voters elected a historic 29 women to Parliament; however, this still fell short of constitutionally-mandated two-thirds gender balance, which requires that no more than two-thirds of an elected body be of the same gender. Some irregularities were reported, including printing mistakes that rendered a number of ballots invalid, resulting in the IEBC having to delay voting for eight positions, including the gubernatorial race in Mombasa.",3,"The IEBC is mandated with conducting free and fair elections and operates under a robust electoral framework. However, the August 2022 election exposed continued rifts and politicization within the IEBC. Days after the election, as the IEBC chairperson prepared to announce the results, fighting briefly erupted at the announcement location, and four of the seven commissioners—who were appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2021—held a separate press conference stating they could not uphold the forthcoming results, claiming opacity in the tabulation process. After calm was restored, the chairperson declared Ruto the winner, raising questions about whether the chairperson can act independently of the majority of the commission.In September, the Supreme Court affirmed that the power to verify and tally presidential election results is vested in the IEBC itself and not the chairperson. Nevertheless, the court found that the IEBC had carried out its constitutional responsibilities to verify, tally, and announce the results of the election, and upheld Ruto’s victory.",2

Following snap elections in February 2021, the Vetëvendosje party won a landslide victory with just over 50 percent of the vote. That March, the Assembly elected Vetëvendosje’s Albin Kurti as prime minister. Kurti had previously served as prime minister between February and June 2020. He won the premiership despite having not run in elections himself; he was barred from doing so by a January 2021 Supreme Court ruling that declared him ineligible to run for parliament because he had been convicted of a crime less than three years previously.The president is elected by the Assembly for a five-year term by a two-thirds majority, or simple majority if after two rounds no candidate has received a two-thirds majority.

The Serb List won 10 seats; other minority parties filled the remaining 10 seats. The election was considered competitive by local and international observers. However, a European Union (EU) election monitoring mission noted a general lack of competition in the Kosovo Serb areas, including, in the race for seats reserved for nonmajority communities, apparently credible allegations that the dominant Kosovo Serb party orchestrated the electoral victories of two recently registered ethnic minority parties.

The parliament, which must approve the choice of heir by majority vote, did so unanimously. The emir delegated many of his powers to Sheikh Meshaal in late 2021, and the crown prince continued to exercise them during 2022.The emir chooses the prime minister and appoints cabinet ministers on the prime minister’s recommendation. At least one minister must be an elected member of parliament. All prime ministers and most senior ministers have been members of the ruling family. Prime Minister Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah, first appointed in 2019, resigned along with his cabinet in April 2022 in advance of a no-confidence vote from the parliament. As the crown prince prepared to form a new cabinet, lawmakers mounted sit-ins to demand early elections, which were ultimately announced in June and held in September. In July, the crown prince named Sheikh Ahmad Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the emir’s eldest son, as prime minister. After a series of disagreements with lawmakers, a new cabinet was appointed in October, featuring two women and two elected members, and it remained in place at year’s end.",0,"The 50-member National Assembly is popularly elected on a formally nonpartisan basis, as political parties are illegal.

This has occurred several times since 2011, usually after lawmakers clashed with senior ministers from the ruling family.Elections were held in September 2022, more than two years ahead of schedule, with a reported voter turnout of about 50 percent. Opposition candidates won a total of 28 seats, and 20 incumbents, including three former ministers, lost their seats. Two candidates won seats while in detention on charges related to their participation in technically illegal tribal primary elections. Shiite candidates took nine seats, while Sunni Islamists, including figures associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafist movement, took at least eight.

kyrgyzstan,"The constitution, ratified in May 2021, returned Kyrgyzstan to a superpresidential system, in which the president is the chief national authority. The president is directly elected and can serve up to two five-year terms. The head of government, the chairman of the cabinet of ministers, is appointed by the president, and effectively serves as the president’s chief of staff. Major protests over the administration of the October 2020 parliamentary elections took place in Bishkek the day after the polls were held and turned violent; demonstrators had clashed with police, forcibly freed prisoners held by the State Committee for National Security (GKNB), and set fire to the building housing the parliament and the president’s office.Within two weeks, then president Sooronbay Jeenbekov accepted the parliament’s nomination of Sadyr Japarov of the Mekenchil (Patriotic) party—who days before had been freed from GKNB custody while serving a prison sentence for kidnapping—as prime minister. Jeenbekov resigned the following day as Japarov supporters, who had in previous days attacked attendees at other political rallies, threatened to march on his residence.Parliament speaker Kanat Isayev was next in the line of succession but declined to assume the presidency, after Japarov supporters called for Isayev’s resignation and arrest. The parliament formally made Japarov acting president the day after he had publicly declared himself acting in both executive positions. He served until November 2020, when he resigned to qualify for an early presidential election scheduled for January 2021.Snap presidential elections were held as planned in January 2021; Japarov was elected to the presidency with 79.2 percent of the vote. The election was marked by historically low voter turnout at 39.2 percent and the massive misuse of administrative resources. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) limited observation mission reported that the elections were not competitive, but had been dominated by Japarov, who had benefited from significant advantages, including “disproportionate financial means” and the use of state resources.",0,"The unicameral parliament consisted of 120 deputies elected by party list in a single national constituency to serve five-year terms before the ratification of the new constitution in May 2021. Constitutional changes and an electoral law signed in August 2021 cut the number of seats to 90, with 54 elected by party list and 36 representing single-member districts.The Central Commission for Elections and Referenda (CEC) originally reported that four parties exceeded the threshold to secure seats in the October 2020 parliamentary elections, three of them affiliated with former president Jeenbekov. Opposition parties refused to accept the results, accusing the victors of vote buying and intimidation; vote-buying evidence was disseminated on social media. Journalists and civil society also accused the victors of misusing administrative resources. The CEC annulled the results two days after the vote was held, selecting a December date for a rerun; in late October, parliamentarians decided to delay the poll indefinitely. Although the sixth session of the parliament was elected in 2015 and their mandate expired in 2020, parliamentarians voted to extend their own mandates after the October election results were annulled, and the deputies continued to serve through December 2021 with no electoral mandate. In November 2021, over a year after the 2020 parliamentary election results had been annulled, new polls were held; voter turnout was recorded at 34 percent. Initial results published by the CEC showed several parties clearing the 5 percent threshold required to enter parliament; these results were later withdrawn, and nearly 10 percent of the ballots cast were discarded as spoiled. CEC officials cited technical errors to explain the changes in the vote count, which resulted in the exclusion of four opposition parties from the parliament. The parties that entered the new parliament were Ata-Jurt Kyrgyzstan with 15 seats, followed by Ishenim with 12; Yntymak, 9; Alyans, 7; Butun Kyrgyzstan, 6; and Yiman Nuru with 5.",1,"Though international observers have deemed Kyrgyzstani electoral laws to be “generally adequate,” such laws are often selectively enforced.

The Sunni-led Future Movement, which had long headed a rival bloc of Muslim and Christian factions, boycotted the elections, contributing to a number of shifts in the makeup of the new assembly. The Lebanese Forces party, a Christian ally of the Future Movement, made significant gains at the expense of the Aoun-backed Free Patriotic Movement, and a group of independent candidates associated with the country’s 2019 reformist protest movement captured 13 seats. The parliament narrowly reelected Nabih Berri of the Hezbollah-allied Amal Movement as its speaker, a post in which he had served since 1992.While the elections were conducted peacefully and were free and fair in many respects, vote buying was rampant, observers from the Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections reported numerous procedural irregularities, and the electoral framework retained fundamental structural flaws associated with the sectarian political system. Turnout was 49 percent overall and nearly 60 percent among voters from the Lebanese diaspora.Municipal elections were also due in May 2022, but in March the parliament approved a government proposal to postpone the balloting by a year due to lack of material and human resources.",2,"Lebanon does not have an independent electoral commission; instead, the Interior Ministry oversees elections. Parliamentary seats are divided among major religious communities under a constitutional formula that does not reflect their current demographic weight. While seat allocations have been adjusted through political agreements to resolve major impasses over the years, there has been no official census in Lebanon since the 1930s, prior to independence. The electoral framework is inclusive and supports pluralism, but it is the product of bargaining among established leaders and tends to entrench the existing sectarian and communalist political system.The 2017 electoral law introduced proportional representation and preferential voting, and improved opportunities for diaspora voting. However, the rules for redistricting and seat allocation still favored incumbent parties. The law sharply raised registration fees for candidates as well as spending caps for campaigns, while allowing private organizations and foundations to promote coalitions and candidates, effectively increasing the advantages of wealthier groups and individuals. As under past electoral laws, members of the military and citizens who had been naturalized for less than 10 years could not participate.",2
lesotho,"Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. King Letsie III serves as the ceremonial head of state. The prime minister is head of government. The head of the majority party or coalition automatically becomes prime minister following elections.General elections held in October 2022 were won by the newly established RFP. The RFP’s founder and leader, businessman Sam Matekane, took office as prime minister later that month, forming a three-party coalition with the Alliance of Democrats (AD) and the Movement for Economic Change (MEC).The elections were hailed as peaceful, fair, and safe by various international observer missions. No security breaches and outcome-altering incidents were reported, though observers raised concerns about the accuracy of the voter roll and noted an uneven playing field amongst parties and candidates due to a lack of campaign finance regulations.",4,"The lower house of Parliament, the National Assembly, has 120 seats; 80 are filled through first-past-the-post constituency votes, and the remaining 40 through proportional representation (PR). The Senate—the upper house of Parliament—consists of 22 principal chiefs who wield considerable authority in rural areas and whose membership is hereditary, along with 11 other members appointed by the king and acting on the advice of the Council of State. Members of both chambers serve five-year terms.In October 2022, the newly established RFP won 56 of 120 seats in the National Assembly, becoming the largest party in Parliament. The Democratic Congress (DC) won 29 seats while eight seats were won by the All Basotho Convention (ABC), the ruling party prior to the elections. The RFP formed a coalition government with the AD and the MEC, which combined had won nine seats. The 2022 general elections were hailed as credible and peaceful by various international observer missions and local observers.",4,"The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has been commended for its independence and its administration of credible and fair elections, particularly in 2022, when it faced capacity and resource constraints. However, the IEC did incorrectly allocate four parliamentary seats following the 2022 polls, though the overall result of the election was not impacted by the error. It is unclear whether the IEC was able to successfully correct the allocation by year-end. Because more than 50 political parties contested the 2022 elections, the IEC struggled to enforce campaign regulations and provide adequate oversight of public funds disbursed to parties during the campaign. The 2022 elections occurred without the enactment of much anticipated political and electoral reforms, which former prime minister Moeketsi Majoro attempted to push through by declaring a state of emergency. The High Court nullified the reforms before the election in September.",3
liberia,"Liberia’s president is directly elected and can serve up to two six-year terms. Since the end of the civil wars in 2003, Liberia has had three peaceful presidential elections. The most recent election, held in 2017, which brought current President George Weah of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) to power after he won a run-off against Unity Party (UP) candidate Joseph Boakai, was assessed by domestic and international observers as generally peaceful and credible, though difficulties in its administration included long queues at polling places and challenges related to voter identification.",3,"Liberia has a bicameral legislature composed of a 30-member Senate and a 73-member House of Representatives; senators are elected to nine-year terms, and representatives to six-year terms. Lower-house elections were held concurrently with the first round of the presidential election in 2017. The CDC won 21 seats, while the UP won 20. The People’s Unification Party (PUP), which was allied to the ruling CDC, won 5 seats, and the LP won 3. The remaining 24 seats were won by independents and other parties. Despite administrative problems, observers considered the elections generally peaceful and well administered, with only minor incidents of violence recorded. Fifteen Senate seats were contested in December 2020. Polling day was largely peaceful, but the campaign period was marred by incidents of fraud and violence. Voter turnout was 34.9 percent. A by-election in Lofa County for a Senate seat in June 2022 was largely free, fair, and transparent despite some tensions between party supporters during the vote counting process.",3,"While the independence of the National Elections Commission (NEC) is mandated by law, its capacity is limited, and it has struggled to enforce regulations. The National Code of Conduct Act is not consistently followed by officials. The NEC managed a December 2020 constitutional referendum, held concurrently with the Senate elections, which included amendments to shorten the terms of the president, the vice president, and lower-house legislators from six years to five; to shorten senators’ terms from nine years to seven; and to end a ban on dual citizenship. In April 2021, four months after ballots were cast, the NEC confirmed that none of the amendments received the required two-thirds of votes to become law. Critics noted flaws in the process that brought the referendum to the ballot, including a lack of openness by political leadership to include proposals that were important to the public and a lack of voter awareness about the issues. Both houses of the legislature discussed and approved amendments to the New Elections Laws (1986) during 2022. The changes would increase fees for candidates looking to participate and could increase government control over electoral jurisprudence. The amendments were sent to the president, and whether he signed them into law is unclear.",2
libya,"In 2020, after years of division between rival administrations based in Tripoli and Tobruk, the United Nations organized an inclusive Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), with representatives from various political factions and civil society. The forum elected Dbeibah as prime minister of the new GNU in February 2021. Members of a three-member Presidential Council were also chosen. In March of that year, the GNU won the approval of the HoR, the Tobruk-based legislature associated with militia commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF) coalition. Despite allegations of vote buying, the legitimacy of the LPDF process, the GNU, and its mandate were internationally recognized.The GNU was tasked with overseeing direct popular elections set for December 2021. However, voting was postponed after the High National Election Commission (HNEC) announced its inability to carry out its mandate. The HoR subsequently announced that it no longer recognized the GNU.In February 2022, the HoR leadership appointed Fathi Bashagha as prime minister of the new GNS, and his cabinet was reportedly approved by a majority of the lawmakers present on March 1. He secured the post without opposition after his only registered challenger allegedly withdrew under unclear circumstances. The GNU led by Dbeibah remained in Tripoli, resisting the GNS’s attempts to displace it, and continued to enjoy the backing of the United Nations and key members of the international community through the end of 2022.",0,"Under an earlier attempt at national reconciliation, the 2015 Libyan Political Agreement (LPA), the unicameral, 200-seat HoR was called upon to remain in place as the interim legislature. The agreement also created the High Council of State (HCS), a secondary consultative body composed of some members of the rival General National Congress (GNC); the Tripoli-based GNC had originally been elected in 2012 and rejected the outcome of the 2014 elections that established the HoR. However, the HoR never formally approved the LPA’s provisions or recognized the Tripoli-based government it established. The 2014 HoR elections were marked by violence, drew the participation of only about 15 percent of the electorate, and were ruled unconstitutional by the Libyan Supreme Court. The HoR’s original mandate formally expired in 2015; while it unilaterally extended its tenure, it has rarely achieved a quorum in practice. After Haftar launched a military offensive against Tripoli in 2019, the HoR became further divided, with members opposed to the campaign meeting in Tripoli and other members continuing to meet in Tobruk. There were attempts to reunify the body in the context of the LPDF process in late 2020, but the dispute remained unresolved.",0,"Despite some legal developments since the fall of the Qadhafi regime, Libya lacks a functioning electoral framework in practice. An August 2011 constitutional declaration, issued by an unelected National Transitional Council, continues to serve as the key governing document for the transitional period. A Constitutional Drafting Assembly (CDA) that was elected in 2014 voted to approve a draft constitution in 2017. In the fall of 2018, the HoR approved a law containing a framework for a constitutional referendum, along with several accompanying amendments to the 2011 constitutional declaration. It then submitted the former, the Referendum Law, to the HNEC, but there was speculation that the new law and amendments would face legal challenges.According to the LPDF transition roadmap, both the HoR and HCS are required to design and agree on an electoral framework for presidential and parliamentary elections. Despite this stipulation, the two bodies issued separate, conflicting electoral laws. The law promulgated by HoR speaker Aguila Saleh, which established rules for a December 2021 presidential election and postponed final plans for parliamentary elections, was accepted by UN envoys. It was criticized by some HoR members for being adopted in violation of parliamentary voting procedures, and for relying on the 2011 constitutional declaration rather than arranging for a referendum on a new constitution.Two days before the December 2021 presidential election date, the HNEC announced that the vote had been postponed by one month, citing inadequacies in the electoral law. Disagreements over the establishment of an electoral framework and a flawed process for determining candidates’ eligibility persisted through the end of the year. Rather than responding to the HNEC’s requests to correct the election process, the HoR passed a motion in January 2022 to establish its own constitutional drafting body and delay elections by at least 14 months.",0

In its 2019 election observer report, the African Union concluded that elections “were peacefully and professionally conducted,” but listed recommendations including reforming political party and candidate finance law, enacting laws designed to increase the number of woman candidates, increasing the participation of civil society in elections, and updating procedures for ballot counting.  As of 2022 these changes have not been instituted.The MSM government indefinitely suspended municipal elections scheduled for June 2021 through the Local Government (Amendment) Act 2021. In April 2022, Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth postponed municipal elections again, this time until June 2023. Jugnauth cited COVID-19 health concerns, despite the simultaneous easing of most COVID-19 restrictions.",4,"Of the National Assembly’s 70 members, 62 are directly elected in 21 constituencies. The MSM’s Morisian Alliance won 42 seats in the November 2019 National Assembly elections. In its January 2022 report, Afrobarometer reported that 59 percent of Mauritians said that the last elections were free and fair but had problems, including 44 percent who felt that votes were not accurately counted or not fairly reflected in the results.Rodrigues, an autonomous territory of Mauritius, held elections in March 2022. The Rodrigues People's Organisation (OPR) party was unseated in favor of an “Alliances of Alliances” coalition. Some commentators viewed the election as a shift towards coalition politics and more fragmented political parties.",4,"The Electoral Supervisory Commission is broadly viewed as impartially supervising the electoral process. There is no law on the financing of electoral campaigns. As of 2022, long-running discussions on electoral reform and party financing laws have not led to concrete action.",3
mexico,"The president is elected to a six-year term and cannot be reelected. Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the left-leaning National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) won the 2018 poll with a commanding 53 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Ricardo Anaya—the candidate of the National Action Party (PAN) as well as of the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) and Citizens’ Movement (MC)—took 22 percent. The results of the 2018 poll represented a stark repudiation of outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which took just 16 percent of the vote. The 2018 election campaign was marked by violence and threats against candidates for state and local offices; at least 145 people died because of election-related violence. Accusations of illicit campaign activities remained frequent at the state and municipal level.A 2019 constitutional amendment enables citizens to initiate a recall referendum halfway through the president’s term. López Obrador considers the recall an opportunity to reinforce his political authority, and in December 2021 both the Supreme Court and the Federal Electoral Tribunal (TEPJF) ordered the National Electoral Institute (INE) to move forward with planning the referendum for April 2022, despite the INE’s claim that the state had budgeted insufficient resources to undertake the balloting. The country’s first-ever recall referendum was ultimately held as planned in April 2022, and saw López Obrador win approximately 90 percent of the vote. The referendum garnered a turnout of roughly 17 percent, significantly less than the 40 percent needed to validate the results. Opposition leaders discouraged their supporters from participating in the referendum, which they condemned as a propaganda exercise and a distraction from the country’s real problems.",3,"Senators are elected for six-year terms through a mix of direct voting and proportional representation, with at least two parties represented in each state’s delegation. In the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the bicameral Congress, 300 members are elected through direct representation and 200 through proportional representation, each for three-year terms. Under a reform that took effect for legislators elected in 2018, senators are eligible to serve up to two six-year terms, and deputies are permitted to serve up to four three-year terms.Since 2018, the MORENA–led coalition has commanded a majority in the 128-member Senate with 70 seats, compared to 24 for the PAN and 15 for the PRI. In the 2021 Chamber of Deputies balloting, MORENA won 198 seats; combined with its allies in the Workers’ Party (PT) and the Green Party (PVEM), the governing coalition maintained a majority with 278 seats, but lost the supermajority that had allowed it to pursue constitutional changes. The PAN led the opposition, winning 114 seats, while its electoral coalition partners in the PRI and PRD won 70 and 15 seats, respectively. MORENA candidates won 11 of the 15 gubernatorial races held in 2021, as well as 4 of the 6 governorships up for election in 2022. Accusations of illicit campaign activities are frequent at the state and federal level, and violations reported in 2021 included misuse of public funds, vote buying, and widespread flouting of campaign finance laws. Allegations of illicit campaign financing persisted ahead of local elections held in June 2022.",3,"The INE supervises elections and enforces political party laws, including strict regulations on campaign financing and the content of political advertising, although control is uneven in practice. While the 2018 and 2021 elections were both generally considered free and fair, the INE and the TEPJF struggled to comprehensively address problems including misuse of public funds, vote buying, and nontransparent campaign financing. Throughout 2021, the INE and the TEPJF were subjected to frequent verbal attacks by López Obrador and MORENA supporters. However, the administration of the 2021 balloting was considered successful.In April 2022, President López Obrador presented a constitutional reform plan that, if adopted, would significantly alter the Mexican electoral system. Among other things, the proposal included provisions that would eliminate all state-level electoral institutes and transfer their responsibilities to the INE and TEPJF; remove the INE’s constitutional mandate to administer the electoral registry; and amend the appointment procedures for INE and TEPJF officials, removing staggered terms. Rights groups expressed concern that the reforms would substantially weaken the independence of the electoral authorities. Congress rejected the proposed reforms in December. However, López Obrador then presented another electoral reform plan that would not involve amending the constitution; the new reform plan, known as “Plan B,” remained awaiting approval at year’s end.",3
micronesia,"The president is both chief of state and head of government and receives assistance from the vice president. Both offices are indirectly elected for four-year terms by members of Congress, with candidates from among the legislature’s four at-large, directly elected state representatives, known as senators. In March 2019, David Panuelo, the senator representing the state of Pohnpei, was chosen as president, defeating incumbent Peter Christian. Vice President Yosiwo George passed away in August 2022. The following month, Congress elected then senator Aren B.

Another 10 members serve two-year terms in single-member districts allocated by population. Each state also has its own elected legislature. All 10 single-member incumbents in Congress won reelection in the March 2021 midterm elections. After Kosrae senator Aren B.

moldova,"The president is elected by direct popular vote for up to two consecutive four-year terms. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the votes in the first round, the two leading candidates compete in a second round. Former prime minister Maia Sandu of the Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) defeated incumbent president Igor Dodon in the two-round November 2020 contest. Sandu won 57.7 percent in the second round, while Dodon won 42.3 percent. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers called the election competitive but reported that electoral authorities did not investigate allegations of first-round irregularities.A prime minister nominated by the president and confirmed by Parliament holds most executive authority. Natalia Gavrilița of the PAS was confirmed as prime minister in August 2021, a month after snap parliamentary polls.",4,"Voters elect members of the 101-seat unicameral Parliament to serve four-year terms. Under the current electoral system, all lawmakers are elected through proportional representation from closed party lists or as independents.In April 2021, the Constitutional Court found sufficient grounds to allow Sandu to dissolve the incumbent Parliament following the December 2020 resignation of former prime minister Ion Chicu. The PAS won 63 seats in the July 2021 snap polls. The Electoral Bloc of Communists and Socialists, which included the Socialist Party (PSRM) and the Communist Party, won 32. The Euroskeptic and pro-Russian Șor Party won 6. OSCE observers considered the elections well administered, competitive, and largely respectful of fundamental freedoms, but noted the negative impact that media bias, a lack of effective campaign finance oversight, inadequate legal frameworks for electoral dispute resolution, and weak judicial independence had on impartiality and trust in the electoral process.",3,"The July 2021 parliamentary elections marked a return to an electoral system based on proportional representation. The polls were affected by fewer irregularities compared with the February 2019 parliamentary elections, which had been administered using a mixed system featuring both single-member constituencies and seats allocated proportionally by party list.OSCE observers found the legal framework governing the 2021 elections to be in line with international good practice; they also commended the implementation of key revisions, including lower thresholds for party registration and stronger gender quotas for candidate lists, in line with previous recommendations.Both lower-level electoral commissions and the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) performed well in the July 2021 elections. OSCE observers reported that the election administration was generally considered trustworthy. However, key decisions made by the CEC appeared to follow partisan lines, including decisions regarding the number of polling stations to be established abroad and for voters residing in Transnistria, as well as on voter transportation.While confidence in electoral administration improved in 2021, the CEC has faced allegations of improper conduct, including the exclusion of the opposition from the CEC leadership selection process and irregular interference in local elections.Moldovan authorities drafted a new electoral code in 2022, intending to finalize it before the local elections due in October 2023. While the PAS majority in Parliament supported the draft in its July 2022 first reading, the opposition criticized some of its provisions, including the envisioned selection process for CEC members. In an October report, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe (CoE) offered several recommendations, including changes to the envisioned dismissal process for CEC members. The local assembly in the Gagauzia region threatened to boycott any elections held under the draft code, which it said would effectively limit the region’s autonomy. The electoral code, which was revised before final passage, was ultimately adopted in December.",3

The 2018 elections were considered credible by international observers. The new political movement Priorité Monaco, led by veteran politician Stéphane Valeri and defectors from the more established Horizon Monaco, won 58 percent of the vote and 21 seats. Horizon Monaco itself took 26 percent and 2 seats, while the Union Monégasque took 16 percent and 1 seat. After the elections, Valeri became president of the National Council, which is regarded as the most powerful elected office in Monaco.

However, in a 2018 report, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) argued that the campaign finance system could be further strengthened.Municipal authorities, led by the mayor of Monaco, form an Electoral Committee that administers elections with support from the Interior Ministry, and observers consider their conduct to be credible. However, technical meetings in preparation for elections are not open to the public, limiting the committee’s transparency.",4
mongolia,"Under 2019 amendments to the 1992 constitution, the president is head of state and is directly elected for a single six-year term. Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh of the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) resigned as prime minister in January 2021, but was nominated by the MPP to run for the same office in the June elections. The candidate for the Democratic Party, Sodnomzundui Erdene, was nominated following a controversial ruling by the Constitutional Court that barred President Khaltmaa Battulga from running again—because the single-term limit on the office was instituted during his presidency, the party argued he should be able to run again. Khaltmaa Battulga subsequently attempted to dissolve the MPP by decree, alleging the party was no longer independent and had become an arm of the military, but neither the Supreme Court nor Parliament adhered to the order.The election campaign for the presidency occurred with some COVID-19 restrictions in place that may have prevented some voters from participating, particularly those who live in Ulaanbaatar but are registered to vote elsewhere. Voter turnout in the June election reached 59.35 percent, only slightly lower from the 2017 election. Khürelsükh won the presidency with 67.69 percent of the vote and the greatest margin of victory in any presidential election since 1990. Sodnomzundui Erdene only received 5.99 percent of the vote while the opposition National Labor Party (HUN) candidate Enkhbat Dangaasuren received 20.31 percent. There were no significant irregularities reported during the election by an observer mission from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai was confirmed by Parliament to replace Khürelsükh as prime minister in January 2021.",4,"Members of the 76-seat parliament, the State Great Hural, are elected for four-year terms. All members were elected to multimember constituencies in the June 2020 elections, with 48 elected via simple-majority voting and 28 via proportional representation. The MPP won 62 seats while the DP won 11. The Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party, the National Labor Party (HUN), and an independent each won 1 seat. Turnout stood at 73.7 percent. An OSCE electoral observation mission was in Mongolia for the election.",4,"Electoral laws are generally fair, though they are often changed shortly before elections and tend to favor the two largest parties.While the General Election Commission (GEC) is sometimes regarded with suspicion over political influence, no major complaints arose from its management of the June 2021 elections.In July 2022, the MPP and the upstart HUN discussed increasing the number of seats in Parliament and switching to a mixed proportional and first-past-the-post electoral system. The MPP suggested the changes to address the challenges of governing with a supermajority in Parliament that discourages members from following the party line. However, in August the Constitutional Court rejected the 2019 amendment that limited parliamentary membership in the cabinet, which killed the momentum for electoral system party finance reform.",3
montenegro,"The president is chief of state and is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. In April 2018, Milo Đukanović of the DPS, who has served as either prime minister or president for most of the last three decades, was elected president with 53.9 percent of the vote. Independent candidate Mladen Bojanić finished second with 33.4 percent. Though Đukanović refused to participate in public debates and some irregularities such as misuse of public resources were reported, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring mission stated that the polling was generally credible and that fundamental rights were respected. It also noted that Đukanović and the DPS enjoyed significant institutional advantages that reduced the poll’s competitiveness.The president nominates the prime minister, who requires legislative approval. Following the parliamentary elections in August 2020, Đukanović nominated Zdravko Krivokapić, leader of the strongest bloc in the postelection coalition, for the position. Krivokapić’s government was approved that December. Politics were in gridlock at the close of 2022, after two governments collapsed following no-confidence votes and lawmakers’ were then unable to form a new government or call snap elections. Krivokapić’s government was toppled in a no-confidence vote in February, initiated by deputy prime minister Dritan Abazović of the United Reform Action (URA) party. In April, a new government led by Abazović was approved, but it collapsed in August after the parliament approved another no-confidence motion initiated by the DPS; it was the shortest-serving government in the country’s history. A month later, the multiparty alliance that had wrested power from the DPS in the 2020 parliamentary elections proposed Miodrag Lekić as prime minister; Đukanović rejected the proposal, saying one of the parties in the alliance had not formally signed off on the nomination, and called for snap elections. His proposition was in turn rejected by the parliament.To resolve the impasse, the parliament adopted controversial legislation that restricts presidential powers by enabling a majority of lawmakers to propose a prime minister-designate if the president refuses to do so. The amendments were deemed unconstitutional by local NGOs, severely criticized by the EU and by US officials, and prompted a wave of protests. The deadlock can only be resolved by the Constitutional Court, which lacked a quorum as of September 2022; a majority of 48 lawmakers—a number requiring broad consensus across parties—is required to elect new judges.",3,"Members of the unicameral, 81-seat parliament—the Skupština—are directly elected for four-year terms.While the DPS once again posted the strongest performance by a single party in the 2020 parliamentary election, taking 30 seats, it failed to secure a majority with its traditional coalition partners. With a narrow 41-seat majority, a new alliance consisting of three coalitions—the Future of Montenegro (27 seats), Peace is Our Nation (10), and In Black and White (4)—gained power. Turnout was high, at 76.64 percent.The OSCE and the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations (ENEMO) noted that the polls took place in an atmosphere of high polarization over issues including church affiliation and national identity. The election administration in some ways violated provisions of the constitution, including because the early election date was never harmonized with other legal obligations; pandemic-related restrictions on movement and assembly impeded campaign activities; and several lawmakers were arrested or charged with various offenses without their parliamentary immunity first being waived. The line between the ruling parties and the state was again blurred during the campaign, as the DPS and its coalition partners gained undue advantage through the widespread misuse of state resources. Nevertheless, the polls were widely considered an improvement from previous years’ contests, with monitors and other analysts concluding that they were conducted in a more secure, orderly, and transparent manner and featured robust participation from across society.In May 2022, the Abazović-led government passed amendments that delayed local elections in 14 municipalities until October, in the interest of holding the year’s remaining local elections on the same day. The Center for Democratic Transition, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), requested a review on grounds that the move violated national laws, as well as international standards for the organization of regularly scheduled elections. The Constitutional Court annulled the amendments in late July.",3,"The conduct of elections in Montenegro is facilitated by a comprehensive legal and administrative framework, but opposition parties have long claimed that this framework is seriously flawed. In March 2021, a new Committee on Comprehensive Electoral Reform, comprised of all parliamentary parties, was formed and began to reform and improve the legal framework to ensure free and fair elections, taking into consideration recommendations of the OSCE and the European Commission (EC). The Democratic Montenegro (DM) party “froze” its membership in the committee in May 2022 over the adoption of amendments that postponed elections in 14 municipalities, and amid claims that opposition perspectives were being ignored. The committee’s mandate ended in June, having made no progress on electoral reform.The Constitutional Court declared the legislative amendments regarding delaying municipal elections unconstitutional in July. In August, the new parliamentary majority amended separate legislation regulating the territorial organization of the country to grant independent municipality status to the Zeta region, which up to that point had been part of the capital. The move, which reduced the number of voters in Podgorica, changed electoral district boundaries in the midst of the electoral process and took place in the absence of meaningful consultation with the constituency.",2
morocco,"Constitutional reforms in 2011 require the king to appoint the prime minister from the party that wins the most seats in parliamentary elections. However, the reforms preserved nearly all of the king’s existing powers: the monarch can disband the legislature, rule by decree, and dismiss or appoint cabinet members.The then ruling Party of Justice and Development (PJD) was trounced in September 2021 elections, and the National Rally of Independents (RNI) and the Istiqlal Party, both closely aligned with the palace, were the primary victors. The king appointed Aziz Akhannouch of the RNI as prime minister. Akhannouch’s oil-and-gas fortune is reportedly worth $2 billion as of mid-2022, making him the second-richest person in Morocco after the king, whose wealth is estimated at $5.7 billion. In keeping with royal prerogative, after the election, the king announced the new 24-member cabinet, with key positions going to technocrats loyal to the palace.",1,"The lower house of Parliament, the Chamber of Representatives, has 395 directly elected members who serve five-year terms. Of these, 305 are elected from 92 multimember constituencies. The remaining 90 are elected from a single nationwide constituency, with 60 seats reserved for women and 30 for people under the age of 40. Members of the 120-seat upper house, the Chamber of Counselors, are chosen by an electoral college—made up of professional, labor, and business organizations as well as local and regional officials—to serve six-year terms.In the September 2021 parliamentary and municipal elections, the PJD won only 13 seats, down from 125. The RNI and the Istiqlal Party, both closely aligned with the palace, took 102 and 81 seats respectively; the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) won 87. Voter turnout was low at 50.4 percent, but was nevertheless an improvement over the 43 percent turnout seen in the 2016 elections, most likely because parliamentary elections were held simultaneously with local and municipal elections. The PJD blamed its poor performance on fraud and irregularities, but offered little evidence. A more plausible explanation is that the party had delivered poorly on past electoral promises—though follow-through is difficult in a political system dominated by the monarchy. The PJD was also blamed for the December 2020 normalization of relations with Israel, a policy that remains unpopular with many Moroccans. The 2021 election results effectively solidified the power of the monarchy, since pro-palace parties and technocrats dominate the new government and are unlikely to challenge the king.",2,"The constitutional and legal framework allows for competitive legislative elections, but the transparency of the process is not guaranteed. Elections are overseen by the Interior Ministry, with some participation by the Justice Ministry, rather than an independent electoral body. Approximately three million Moroccans live abroad, and electoral laws make it exceedingly difficult for citizens outside of Morocco to cast their ballots. Changes in the electoral law made in March 2021 made it less likely for one party to win decisively.",2
mozambique,"The president, who appoints the prime minister, is elected by popular vote for up to two five-year terms. President Filipe Nyusi of the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) won the presidential contest in 2019 with 73 percent of the vote. Additionally, because FRELIMO won the most votes in all provinces, it received the right to select all 10 of the country’s provincial governors. Turnout was reported at just over 50 percent.The campaign was marred by violence, much of which targeted opposition members or their supporters, and several politicians and activists were killed. Anastácio Matavel, a respected independent election observer, was killed that October; several members of an elite police unit were convicted of Matavel’s murder in 2020, though questions remain about the motivation behind the crime. Further violence was reported at dozens of polling stations on election day, as were instances of harassment of poll workers, notably those appointed by the opposition, with police taking part in the intimidation. Additionally, there were credible reports of ballot-box stuffing; interference with the registration of election observers; serious voting-register inaccuracies; and tabulation irregularities. As in past elections, FRELIMO enjoyed a strong advantage due to its use of state resources to fund campaign activities and secure media coverage.Opposition parties denounced the election as fraudulent. Civil society organizations and international observers characterized the polls as not free, unfair, nontransparent, and the worst since the introduction of multiparty democracy in 1994. They also argued that the ruling party had captured the electoral machinery through the National Elections Commission’s (CNE) appointment process. International observers from the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), the European Union (EU), and the US embassy expressed concern about the reports of irregularities and election-related violence, but ultimately recognized the outcome.",1,"Members of the 250-seat unicameral Assembly of the Republic are elected to five-year terms. The 2019 legislative elections were held concurrently with the presidential election. FRELIMO took 184 seats, up from 144 previously. The Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) won 60 seats, down from 89 previously, and the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) took 6 seats, down from 17 previously.The legislative polls were marred by the same violence, irregularities, and fraud allegations as the presidential election. International observers objected to their conduct but accepted the results; opposition parties rejected the elections; and a coalition of civil society groups called them patently flawed. In May 2022, President Nyusi suggested postponing the election of district assemblies, which are scheduled to take place in 2024. The proposed postponement of the elections has been met with sharp criticism by the opposition; RENAMO leaders have repeatedly insisted that the elections must be held as planned. In December, Nyusi announced that a team would be established to determine the feasibility of holding the elections as originally scheduled.",1,"Elections are administered by the CNE and a support body, the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration (STAE). While the CNE’s members hail from FRELIMO, RENAMO, the MDM, and civil society, FRELIMO effectively controls the selection process. Domestic and international observers have long argued that this structure has led to the politicization of the body and deeply undermines stakeholder confidence in its operations. The CNE’s administration of the 2019 elections drew sharp domestic and international criticism. Among other significant issues, large discrepancies emerged between the CNE’s voter rolls and records kept by the National Institute of Statistics, notably in Gaza Province, a FRELIMO stronghold. CNE records showed more than 300,000 more registered voters in Gaza than voting-age adults counted in the 2017 census. In April 2022, the European Union Election Follow-up Mission (EU EFM) published its final report on the 2019 elections. The EU EFM noted that there had been little to no progress made in implementing any of the 20 recommendations issued by the election observation mission in 2019. The report also noted that the implementation of the majority of the recommendations “is dependent on the initiative and political will of the executive and the legislature,” both of which are under FRELIMO control.",1
myanmar,"The constitutional order created in 2008 by the military was overturned by a February 2021 coup, which installed a military junta led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, head of the armed forces. President Win Myint and State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, de facto leader of the NLD, have remained in detention since the early hours of the coup and have both been convicted on far-reaching and spurious charges ranging from incitement against the military to violating pandemic restrictions, among others. By December 2022, Suu Kyi had been sentenced to 33 years in prison on a total of 19 different charges, designed to keep her detained indefinitely. Suu Kyi had previously been held by the former military junta under house arrest during three separate periods for a total of 15 years for her prodemocracy views.",0,"The bicameral Assembly of the Union consists of the 440-seat lower House of Representatives and the 224-seat upper House of Nationalities. Representatives serve five-year terms. A quarter of the seats in both houses are reserved for the military and are filled through appointment by the head of the armed forces. The remainder are filled through direct elections in a first-past-the-post system.Though the 2020 parliamentary elections were recognized as credible, they featured significant flaws, including the exclusion of many Muslim candidates and the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya; the cancelation by the Union Election Commission (UEC) of voting in conflict-affected districts; limited access of opposition parties to state-run media during the campaign period; and pandemic-related restrictions on in-person campaigning. The NLD won a convincing majority, but the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) refused to accept the election results, alleging widespread fraud.In February 2021, hours before the new representatives were to be seated, the military seized control of the government, imposing a state of emergency, dissolving the parliament, and detaining or placing under house arrest hundreds of elected officials. The military’s plans for future elections remain in doubt.",0,"Various features of the electoral framework undermined the democratic nature of recent elections before the 2021 coup. These include the military’s role in presidential nominations and appointments to both chambers of parliament, the UEC’s lack of independence, as well as rigid citizenship laws and excessive residency requirements that prevented large numbers of people from voting or standing for office. After seizing power in February 2021, military leadership justified their rejection of the 2020 elections by citing the USDP’s fraud allegations, flaws in electoral administration, and the NLD’s “failure” to address alleged voter list discrepancies. The military regime also dissolved the UEC before reinstating the body with all new members, later charging a number of former UEC commissioners with electoral fraud. In October 2021, the reconstituted UEC announced plans to replace the current first-past-the-post system with a proportional representation system prior to the country’s next elections, a move that was endorsed by Min Aung Hlaing in January 2022. Opposition parties claim the plan is an attempt to keep the military in power. Though the military regime previously pledged to hold new elections in August 2023, in an August 2022 speech extending the country’s state of emergency, Min Aung Hlaing said that elections can only be held when Myanmar is “stable and peaceful,” raising further doubts over the military’s commitments to swiftly hold elections.",0

In 2019, Hage Geingob of the South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO) was reelected with 56.3 percent of the vote. While international observers deemed polls peaceful and results credible, concerns were raised about electronic voting machines’ lack of a verifiable paper trail, long waiting times, and delays in the counting and release of results.",4,"The National Council, the upper chamber of the bicameral parliament, has 42 seats, with members appointed by regional councils for six-year terms. The lower house, the National Assembly, has 96 seats filled by popular election for five-year terms using party-list proportional representation.SWAPO won a lower-house majority of 63 seats (65.5 percent of the vote) in the 2019 elections. The Popular Democratic Movement (PDM) won 16 seats, while the Landless People’s Movement (LPM) won 4. International observers considered the polls competitive and credible, though concerns were raised about several aspects of the electoral process.SWAPO also won a majority of votes cast in the regional elections in November 2020. In December 2020, the Electoral Court accepted a motion from the Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN) to reject some results due to some irregularities flagged by the opposition All People’s Party (APP) and ordered a recount in September 2021 for the Ndonga Linena constituency. The SWAPO candidate won the recount. In October 2021, President Geingob encouraged party supporters to retaliate against the ECN for permitting the rejection of the initial results.",4,"The electoral framework is robust and generally well implemented. The 2019 polls were declared free and fair by international election observers, although they raised concerns over other aspects of the electoral process. Controversy around the use of electronic machines dominated the 2019 elections, with some party leaders expressing doubt about the results for want of a verifiable paper trail. The use of electronic voting machines without paper trails was ruled invalid in February 2020, and the ECN confirmed in June 2022 that the next elections will use paper ballots. In July 2020, the High Court ruled that the ECN acted unconstitutionally when it removed names from a PDM candidate list, and the ECN and PDM lost the case on appeal in May 2022.In March 2022, the ECN stated it aimed to increase its operational independence during the launch of its five-year strategic plan for 2022–27. In April, opposition parties objected to the appointment of Gerson Sindano to the ECN on procedural grounds and because of his well-known political affiliation to the ruling SWAPO party.",3

nepal,"The president is head of state and elected to up to two five-year terms by a parliamentary electoral college and state assemblies. The prime minister is elected by parliament. The legitimacy of executive office holders is largely determined by the conduct of legislative and provincial elections.Sher Bahadur Deuba was sworn in as prime minister in July 2021. He was appointed following a Supreme Court decision that reinstated parliament for the second time that year—former prime minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli dissolved the body in December 2020 and May 2021, causing a constitutional crisis. There has been no significant threat to the executive since that crisis. The 2022 elections resulted in Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal-–Maoist Center (CPN-MC), becoming prime minister at the head of a coalition that includes the Communist Party of Nepal–Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) and the new Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), among others.The current president, Bidhya Bhandari, was reelected in March 2018.",3,"Members of the 275-seat House of Representatives are elected to five-year terms; 165 are directly elected, while 110 are elected by proportional representation.

In late 2020 and May 2021, former prime minister Oli dissolved parliament in a bid to retain power. In July 2021, the Supreme Court restored the National Assembly and its legitimately elected representatives remained in power. Elections were successfully held in November 2022 to replace both the national legislature and provincial assemblies. A coalition government was formed in late December.",4,"The legal framework for elections is sound and facilitates the conduct of credible polls.

nicaragua,"Nicaragua’s constitution provides for a directly elected president, and elections are held every five years. Constitutional reforms in 2014 eliminated term limits and required the winner of the presidential ballot to secure a simple plurality of votes. Daniel Ortega was first elected in in 2006. In December 2020, the National Assembly, which is controlled by Ortega’s FSLN, passed the Law in Defense of the Rights of the People to Independence, Sovereignty and Self-Determination for Peace, also known as the Sovereignty Law. The law provides authorities a broad framework to arbitrarily detain, investigate, and ban individuals from running for or holding public office. The Ortega regime has used this law to arrest opposition candidates and government critics.In November 2021, the government announced that Ortega had been reelected, allegedly taking 75 percent of the votes and defeating Constitutionalist Liberal Party candidate Walter Espinoza. Authorities claimed voter turnout was 65 percent, but a local citizen-run election watchdog recorded that turnout was closer to 18.5 percent. The Organization of American States (OAS) stated that the poll could not meet the criteria for free and fair elections. Ortega was inaugurated to a fourth consecutive term in January 2022.",0,"The constitution provides a 92-seat unicameral National Assembly, with members chosen through proportional representation. Two seats are reserved for the previous president and the runner-up in the most recent election.

The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) annulled the legal status of the Democratic Restoration Party, Citizens for Liberty (CxL), and other rivals. Political parties that remained presented no meaningful challenge to the FSLN. The government announced that the FSLN had won 74 percent of the vote and was assigned 75 legislative seats. Election monitoring missions were not allowed to observe the vote.In July 2022, regime-aligned armed groups and the national police took control of five mayoralties that had been held by the CxL. In the November local elections, the FSLN faced no meaningful opposition when it won control of all 153 municipalities.",0,"The CSE and judiciary generally serve the interests of the FSLN and have played a crucial role in strengthening Ortega and the FSLN’s power.

The CSE also employed the Sovereignty Law to ban opposition candidates from running in that November’s legislative elections and from ever holding public office.",0
niger,"The president is directly elected to up to two five-year terms. The first round of elections, held in December 2020, was marked by isolated reports of attempted vote buying and the disqualification of a major opposition candidate, but was largely peaceful.Mohamed Bazoum, a former interior minister and the candidate of the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS–Tarayya), won 55.7 percent of the vote in the February 2021 runoff. His opponent, former president Mahamane Ousmane (1993–96), won 44.3 percent. The Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) reported a turnout of 62.9 percent. Domestic and international observers deemed the electoral process satisfactory despite irregularities. While Ousmane contested the results, alleging fraud, the Constitutional Court validated Bazoum’s victory that March. Bazoum was sworn in in April to replace term-limited incumbent Mahamadou Issoufou, marking the first transfer of power between elected presidents in Nigerien history.The postelectoral period was affected by insecurity. Protests were held in Niamey and several other towns after the second-round results were announced, with events in the capital becoming violent. The government reported that two people were killed during the protests on February 25. Internet access was restricted for 10 days beginning on February 24. The government also claimed to foil a coup attempt in late March, days before Bazoum’s inauguration.",3,"There are 171 seats in the unicameral National Assembly, 158 of which are directly elected from 8 multimember constituencies; 8 which are reserved for minority representatives, who are elected directly from special single-seat constituencies; and 5 that are reserved for Nigeriens living abroad.Nigeriens abroad were unable to participate in the late December 2020 parliamentary elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but voters within Niger voted to fill the 166 domestic seats concurrently with the first round of the presidential contest. Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) observers called the elections relatively free and fair, and lauded the participation of young and female voters. The PNDS–Tarayya won 80 seats, the Nigerien Democratic Movement for an African Federation (MODEN/FA Lumana) won 19, and the Patriotic Movement for the Republic and the National Movement for the Development of Society each won 13. The new parliament took its seats in March 2021.In October 2022, the CENI began the process of biometric enrollment for Nigeriens living abroad in preparation for elections to the 5 diaspora seats in the parliament. The program involved deploying equipment and training staff for enrollment operations in 15 countries selected for large Nigerian expatriate populations and consular infrastructure, with expected outreach to over 100,000 eligible voters.",3,"The electoral code offers a framework for fair elections. However, the opposition, pointing to reports of widespread irregularities in recent elections, among other issues, has cast doubt over the impartiality of the CENI and the Constitutional Court, which together approve candidate lists and validate election results. In 2017, the government and the opposition disagreed over the appointment of a new commission to organize the 2020 elections; the government unilaterally appointed the new commission after the opposition boycotted the process.While 41 candidates registered to participate in the 2020 presidential elections, 11 were disqualified by the Constitutional Court that November (most of whom had failed to pay the registration fee). MODEN/FA Lumana leader Hama Amadou was disqualified over a 2017 human-trafficking conviction which he called bogus.In January 2022, the government recognized Tahirou Seydou, president of Amadou’s MODEN/FA Lumana—the most-represented opposition party in the parliament—as the head of opposition. Niger’s constitution guarantees certain rights to the head of opposition. In May 2022, the government adopted an ordinance enhancing the status of the head of opposition, adding to its mandate and allocating more resources to the office.In September 2022, majority and opposition leaders met to resume political dialogue in the CNDP, a platform that brings together the majority, the opposition, and nonaffiliated parties to discuss political disputes, including those related to the organization of elections. Opposition parties had boycotted the CNDP for two years due to disagreements related to the 2020 general elections.",2

President Buhari repeatedly vetoed the bill during this period, citing inconsistencies with existing law. The National Assembly passed an Electoral Act Amendment Bill in November 2021. Buhari declined to sign it in December, objecting to its provisions for party primary contests. Buhari ultimately assented to the bill in February 2022, signing the new Electoral Act, 2022, into law.

In April, Khan dissolved the parliament to avoid a no-confidence vote, but the Supreme Court ruled his effort unconstitutional and ordered the parliament to return. Khan was ousted later that month, becoming the first premier in the country’s history to lose their post in such a fashion. Shehbaz Sharif of the PML-N succeeded him, backed by a new coalition.The president, who plays a more symbolic role, is elected for up to two five-year terms by an electoral college comprising the two chambers of the parliament and the provincial assemblies.

Parties and candidates linked to active Islamist militant groups, including Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) and Allah-o-akbar Tehreek, also participated in the polls. Voter turnout was 52 percent. Polling was orderly, but the elections were affected by reporting delays. Media restrictions and judicial rulings affected the PML-N. In April 2022, after the PTI-led government fell, a coalition comprising the PML-N, the PPP, and the JUI-F took office.By-elections for eight National Assembly seats were held in October 2022, a consequence of the power struggle that forced Imran Khan out of power. A large number of PTI lawmakers offered their resignations after Khan lost the premiership, of which 11 were accepted by the speaker.

Violence was particularly acute in the Highlands Region, but hijacking of ballot boxes also occurred in the Kabwum and Markham Districts of Morobe Province. Tribal fighting in the town of Mendi led to the outcome in that Southern Highlands Province seat being decided without a count of all the ballot boxes.

Also during the election period, the return of writs was repeatedly extended owing to delays in the counting process, and the Electoral Commission ultimately decided to declare MPs elected even in districts where ballot boxes were hijacking and burned, instead of finding that such elections had “failed.”",1
paraguay,"The president is directly elected to no more than one five-year term. The conservative Colorado Party has held the presidency for all but 5 of the past 75 years.Mario Abdo Benítez of the Colorado Party won the presidency in the 2018 election.  Efraín Alegre, then representing the opposition Alianza Ganar coalition, took 43 percent. International observers described the election as largely fair, although allegations were made of fraud, vote-buying, and a media blackout affecting other candidates.Party primaries in December 2022 proceeded normally, despite the destruction of some 7,700 electronic voting machines—roughly a third of the nation’s total—in a September fire at the national electoral agency. Santiago Peña, backed by former president Cartes, will lead the Colorado Party into the presidential election scheduled for April 2023.

In the 2018 legislative elections, the Colorado Party won a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, but no party won a Senate majority.

peru,"The president is chief of state and head of government. Presidents are directly elected to a five-year term and may serve nonconsecutive terms. Prior to 2021, the last president to be seated through a national election was Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2016. Kuczynski resigned in March 2018 as lawmakers prepared to hold an impeachment vote against him over corruption allegations. Vice President Martín Vizcarra was quickly sworn in to replace him, in accordance with legal procedures. Vizcarra repeatedly clashed with legislators, and used his authority to dissolve Congress in September 2019 following a vote of no confidence in his government. Vizcarra was ousted in November 2020 after congressional opponents invoked the constitution’s controversial “moral incapacity” clause; many outside observers characterized the removal as an abuse of a vague constitutional clause.Vizcarra was replaced by Manuel Merino, from the center-right Acción Popular party, who selected a conservative cabinet and signaled an aggressive policy agenda. An initial wave of protests in Lima were met with violent police repression, which provoked even larger protests across the country. After less than a week and the resignation of several cabinet members, Merino was forced to resign.After Merino’s resignation, Francisco Sagasti, who had been elected as president of Congress just days earlier, acceded to the presidency with a mandate of seeking unity and shepherding the country to general elections in April 2021.Elections were held as planned in April 2021, followed by a second-round vote in June. The preliminary results of the runoff showed Pedro Castillo of the leftist Peru Libre party winning 50.13 percent of the vote, defeating Keiko Fujimori, who received 49.87 percent of the vote. The election, which saw a voter turnout of over 70 percent, was deemed free and fair by both local and international election monitors. However, Fujimori challenged the initial results, accusing Castillo of vote tampering, prompting electoral authorities to delay releasing the official results of the election. The National Board of Elections (JNE) ultimately dismissed Fujimori’s claims of electoral fraud, and officially declared Castillo’s victory in July.In December 2022, hours before Congress planned to hold a vote on impeaching Castillo on charges of “moral incapacity,” Castillo attempted to illegally dissolve Congress and seize power in a so-called autogolpe (self-coup). Members of his government and the military immediately denounced Castillo’s actions, and he was removed from office that day after Congress voted to impeach him. Police arrested Castillo hours later on charges of sedition and conspiracy “for violating the constitutional order.” Castillo remained in prison at year’s end.After Castillo was ousted, Congress appointed then vice president Dina Boluarte to the presidency according to legal guidelines. Boluarte took office within hours of Castillo’s removal, becoming both Peru’s first woman president and the country’s sixth president in less than five years.",3,"Members of the 130-member unicameral Congress are elected for five-year terms; reelection is not permitted. Congressional balloting employs an open-list, region-based system of proportional representation, with a 5 percent vote hurdle for a party to enter the legislature.Ten parties entered Congress following the 2021 general elections, which were deemed competitive and peaceful by international observers. Castillo’s Peru Libre won 37 seats, becoming the largest party represented in Congress, followed by Keiko Fujimori’s previously dominant, right-wing FP party, which took 24. No party won a majority of seats.In December 2022, then president Castillo illegally attempted to dissolve Congress, announcing that he would rule by decree until new legislative elections could be held. In response, members of Congress refused to leave congressional grounds and moved to impeach Castillo, voting “overwhelmingly” to remove the president.

philippines,"The president is both head of state and head of government and is directly elected to a single six-year term. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. won the May 2022 presidential election with a 58 percent vote share in the Philippines’ plurality-rule electoral system. Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo, a progressive candidate and a prodemocracy activist, finished second with 28 percent.The vice president is directly elected on a separate ticket and may serve up to two successive six-year terms. Sara Duterte, the running mate of Marcos and daughter of outgoing president Rodrigo Duterte, won with 61 percent of the vote. She defeated Senator Francis Pangilinan, Robredo’s running mate. While elections in the Philippines are free from overt restrictions on voting, the campaign landscape was skewed by rampant disinformation on social media; the phenomenon involves public relations firms and a highly organized, lucrative infrastructure. Twitter removed a coordinated network of accounts promoting Marcos in December 2021, while fact-checkers identified widespread networks spreading false or misleading content and negative messages about Robredo. Vote buying and selling remains rampant.",3,"The 24 members of the Senate are elected on a nationwide ballot and serve six-year terms, with half of the seats up for election every three years. The 299 members of the House of Representatives serve three-year terms, with 241 elected in single-member constituencies and the remainder elected through party-list voting. May 2022 elections returned a supermajority for Marcos, Jr.’s UniTeam alliance in both houses.Legislative elections feature the same relatively free campaign environment as presidential elections, as well as the same problems with rampant disinformation and vote buying. Candidates who challenge incumbents risk serious intimidation, including death threats.",3,"The Commission on Elections (Comelec) performs both election management and adjudication functions, and has working relationships with a number of civil society groups. Members are appointed by the president, confirmed by a congressional working group, and serve nonrenewable seven-year terms. Election monitors have noted that in practice this process has few safeguards against partisan appointments, and that the president may anyway circumvent legislative scrutiny by appointing Comelec members when Congress is not in session.Comelec’s performance in recent years has been satisfactory, though it has been criticized for technical glitches and procurement issues. Commission leaders have at times responded to criticism of Comelec’s operations with vitriol, including, in 2022, threats to jail critics. The Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) described Comelec’s administration of the 2022 elections as “highly capable,” but noted problems such as a slow response to and poor contingency plans for significant technical issues that occurred on election day. Postelection protests took place in several cities at which participants criticized what they saw the authority’s sloppy performance.",3
poland,"The president is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. The president’s appointment of a prime minister must be confirmed by the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament. While the prime minister holds most executive power, the president also has some influence, particularly over defense and foreign policy matters. Andrzej Duda, the PiS candidate, was reelected in July 2020, winning 51 percent of the vote in the second round. Turnout was 68.1 percent, the second highest since 1989.The election was originally scheduled for that May. In April, amid political conflict over whether to hold the polls during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government drafted plans to hold the vote as scheduled but with mail-in ballots, transferring the election’s administration to the post office instead of the constitutionally legitimate National Electoral Commission (PKW). The government ultimately backtracked, and the first round was called in June.Observers noted that the government had failed to meet its constitutional obligations by abandoning the originally scheduled vote without any formal procedure. In September 2020, an administrative court ruled that the prime minister had broken the law in attempting to transfer the election’s administration to the post office. In 2021, the Supreme Audit Office (NIK) blamed high-ranking officials for seeking to organize the mail-in vote without a legal basis and at considerable cost. The government has repeatedly defended the legality of its actions.Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers concluded that the election was competitive and well-organized, but was tarnished by “hostility” and “biased coverage by the public broadcaster,” which PiS had effectively transformed into a government mouthpiece. The observers noted the insufficiency of regulations governing public officials’ campaign activities, with Duda receiving an “undue advantage” from campaigning by high-ranking officials including Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Observers also raised concerns over the persistent use of homophobic rhetoric by Duda, his team, and PiS’s media allies.Prime Minister Morawiecki was appointed in 2017 with the approval of PiS’s parliamentary majority. He remained in his post at the end of 2022.",3,"Members of the bicameral Parliament are elected for four-year terms. The 460-seat Sejm is elected by proportional representation and holds most legislative authority. The 100 members of the Senate, the upper house, are elected in single-member constituencies. The Senate can delay and amend legislation but has few other powers.In the October 2019 parliamentary elections, PiS won a second term with 43.6 percent of the vote, retaining its 235 lower-house seats. This majority initially allowed PiS to continue governing without formal coalition partners, though two smaller parties, United Poland and Agreement, were included within its electoral lists and parliamentary caucus. In August 2021, Jarosław Gowin, the leader of Agreement, left the ruling camp with a number of lawmakers. The coalition continued to pass legislation by making deals with smaller parties and individual parliamentarians.The centrist Civic Platform (PO) party won 134 seats. Four other parties or coalitions passed the threshold to enter the Sejm, including left-wing and far-right parties that had been absent during the previous term. PiS narrowly lost control of the Senate in 2019, with an opposition coalition taking 51 seats and PiS winning 48.OSCE observers concluded that the 2019 elections were generally conducted in a “professional and transparent” manner. However, they expressed concern that judicial reforms had left a “lack of trust in prosecutors and courts to handle election-related complaints independently.” They also noted that “nationalist and homophobic rhetoric gave rise to a sense of threat,” which they echoed in their report on the 2020 presidential election.In December 2021, a research team at the University of Toronto reported that a mobile phone belonging to a Polish opposition politician, then the head of the PO campaign team, had been hacked with Pegasus spyware ahead of the polls. Text messages stolen from his phone were used in negative reports about him on PiS-controlled public television broadcasts during the campaign. Phones of an opposition-linked lawyer and a prosecutor critical of PiS’s judicial reforms were also hacked. In a November 2022 report, the European Parliament said Warsaw’s use of Pegasus may have affected elections to that body as well as national elections.",4,"Poland’s electoral framework and its implementation have generally ensured free and fair elections, though 2017–18 legal changes have increased the potential for political influence over the PKW, which manages elections, oversees party finances, and can withhold state subsidies. Previously, all nine PKW members were nominated by courts. Seven members are now chosen by Parliament. As the largest parliamentary grouping, PiS was allowed to nominate a maximum of three members at the beginning of the current parliamentary term. PiS could also exert influence over the member picked by the Constitutional Tribunal (TK), which is currently led by PiS-installed judges. The PKW was also affected by PiS’s attempt to order the postal service to administer a mail-in voting process in 2020 without passing proper legislation.The Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs, a Supreme Court chamber whose members are appointed by the politicized National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), can validate or reject election and referendum results. The chamber’s substantial power, along with its vulnerability to politicization, further threatens the integrity of electoral oversight.In November 2022, Parliament passed and President Duda signed a law extending the term of local governments to April 2024, ostensibly so that local elections do not interfere with parliamentary elections due in 2023. Observers warned that the law would impact the functioning of local government and was passed to protect PiS’s electoral prospects.",3

Constitutional amendments approved in 2020 allow Putin, but not future presidents, to run for an additional two consecutive terms, potentially extending his rule to 2036.As with past elections, Putin’s 2018 reelection campaign benefited from advantages including preferential media treatment, numerous abuses of incumbency, and procedural irregularities during the vote count. His most influential rival, Aleksey Navalny, was disqualified before the campaign began due to a politically motivated criminal conviction, creating what the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) called “a lack of genuine competition.” The funding sources for Putin’s campaign were notably opaque.",0,"The Federal Assembly consists of the 450-seat State Duma and an upper chamber, the Federation Council.

However, the Office of the Electoral Commissioner announced an extra seat for the HRPP on the grounds that the five women elected constituted 9.8 percent of the 51 members, short of the required 10 percent. This would give each side 26 seats. Citing the supposed tie, the head of state called for fresh elections.Both the electoral commissioner’s interpretation of the gender quota and the head of state’s effort to call snap elections were struck down by the Supreme Court in May 2021. The new parliament was ordered to sit that month to select a new government. With the incumbent leadership still refusing to concede, the outgoing speaker prevailed upon the parliamentary clerk to lock the doors of the legislature, prompting FAST lawmakers to gather outside the building and participate in Mata‘afa’s impromptu swearing-in ceremony, which was eventually upheld by the courts in July 2021. FAST made further gains in November 2021 by-elections, solidifying its governing majority.

In May 2022, the Supreme Court ruled a third woman elected under that quota, bringing the total number of women in Parliament to seven (four of whom were elected by ordinary means). However, this last ruling was reversed on appeal in November, reducing the number of women in Parliament to six. Independent candidate Fo‘isala Lilo Tu‘u Ioane won a June 2022 by-election and subsequently joined the ruling FAST. At the end of 2022, due to internal party defections, FAST held 31 of the 53 seats.",3,"The constitutional and legal framework for elections is largely democratic and fairly implemented. However, only matai (family heads who hold honorific customary titles) are allowed to stand as candidates. There are currently at least 60,000 matai titles recognized by the Land and Titles Court, though individuals often hold multiple titles. Only about 2 percent of matai titleholders are women. Candidates are also subject to residency and traditional village service requirements. All adult citizens over 21 years of age have the right to vote, which had previously been limited to matai before 1990.Legislation adopted in September 2021 allowed absentee voting within Samoa, meaning voters in the imminent by-elections would not have to travel to their home constituencies to cast ballots.",3

The election was marred by irregularities, including allegations of first-round vote-counting errors. The Constitutional Court, meanwhile, issued multiple rulings in response to third-place candidate Delfim Nevès’s request before ultimately denying it. The second round was not affected by fraud allegations, and both domestic and international observers ultimately assessed the elections as largely free and fair.The prime minister, who holds most day-to-day executive authority, is appointed by the president based on the results of legislative elections.

A coalition of the Movement of Independent Citizens/Socialist Party and the Party of National Unity won 5, while the Basta Movement won 2. Turnout stood at 65.4 percent. The vote was marred by allegations of irregularities, including vote buying. Demonstrators blocked access to polling stations near a hospital in São Tomé to protest a lack of drinking water. The National Electoral Commission (CEN) took over a day to report provisional results and delegated the reporting of final results to the Constitutional Court; ADI supporters protested at CEN headquarters in response to the delay, burning tires. European Union (EU) observers called the polls themselves as “peaceful and orderly” but criticized the absence of campaign spending limits and “difficult enforcement of the ban on foreign funding.”Local and regional elections, including for Príncipe’s regional assembly, were concurrently held with the parliamentary elections.

saudi-arabia,"Saudi Arabia’s king is chosen by his predecessor from among male descendants of the country’s founder, though the choice must be approved by a council of senior princes, the Allegiance Council. The king rules for life. King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud appointed his son, Mohammed bin Salman, as crown prince in 2017, displacing the prince’s older cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, who was stripped of all official positions. Bin Nayef was detained along with a sibling of King Salman in 2020 on charges of treason over an alleged plot to overthrow both the king and the crown prince.The cabinet, which is appointed by the king, passes legislation that becomes law once ratified by royal decree. King Salman doubled as prime minister until September 2022, when Mohammed bin Salman, who had been deputy prime minister and minister of defense, was appointed to the premiership. The move was expected to provide the crown prince with sovereign immunity from a US lawsuit related to his role in the 2018 murder of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Turkey. Mohammed bin Salman’s younger brother Khalid bin Salman, who had been the deputy defense minister, became defense minister.",0,"The king appoints the 150 members of the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council), who serve in an advisory capacity and wield no legislative authority, for four-year terms.

In the 2015 elections, two-thirds of the seats on the 284 councils were open to voting, while the rest were filled through appointment by the minister of municipal and rural affairs. Women were allowed to vote and run as candidates for the first time, and a small number won seats. Elections due in 2019 were postponed indefinitely without any clear official explanation.",0,"The electoral framework lacks constitutional protections, and the 2015 municipal elections were subject to onerous restrictions. The kingdom’s rules on gender segregation were applied to campaigns, meaning no candidates could produce posters showing their faces or meet in person with voters of the opposite sex. Candidates were also barred from giving media interviews, leading many to campaign via social media. Several candidates were disqualified for unclear reasons, though some were reinstated after appeals. Ultimately, a small fraction of the citizen population participated in the elections, reflecting doubts about the effectiveness of the advisory councils.",0
senegal,"The president is chief of state and head of government, and is directly elected to a maximum of two consecutive terms. In 2016, the presidential term was reduced via referendum from seven years to five, effective after the end of President Macky Sall’s first term in 2019.In the February 2019 presidential election, Sall, of the Alliance for the Republic (APR), defeated four challengers including former prime minister Idrissa Seck of the Rewmi Party and Ousmane Sonko of the Patriots of Senegal for Ethics, Work, and Fraternity (PASTEF) party.While international observers declared the election credible, it was marred by the exclusion of two prominent opposition politicians, Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade, who might have seriously challenged President Sall. In January 2019, just weeks before the polls, the Constitutional Council ruled they were both ineligible to run for president because they had been convicted in separate, politically fraught corruption cases.In September 2022, following the National Assembly elections, President Sall appointed Amadou Ba as prime minister. Ba became the first to hold the role since it was reinstated by constitutional changes in 2021, after having been abolished in May 2019. Further constitutional changes adopted in December 2021 reintroduced the accountability of the government to the National Assembly—a provision that had also been removed in 2019—and restored the president’s power to dissolve the legislative body.",3,"Members of Senegal’s 165-seat National Assembly are elected to five-year terms, with 112 elected in single-member districts, and 53 by proportional representation. In the July 2022 election, the ruling United in Hope (BBY) coalition won 82 seats, a decrease from the previous 125. Liberate the People, a new coalition led by Ousmane Sonko, won 56, and former president Abdoulaye Wade’s coalition Wallu Sénégal (Save Senegal) came in third with 24 seats, an improvement from the previous 19. Three smaller coalitions each won a single seat.Both BBY and Liberate the People initially claimed victory immediately following the July election, with Liberate the People joining forces with Wallu Sénégal in an effort to control the assembly. However, although BBY lost the absolute majority it had previously enjoyed, it successfully formed the narrowest possible majority coalition with the support of the representative from one of the single-seat coalitions.International observers described the parliamentary elections as peaceful, transparent, and successfully administered, despite significant procedural errors and logistical challenges. They noted the exclusion of opposition candidates as a particular concern in the election lead-up. The first-choice candidates list put forth by Liberate the People was rejected in June on technical grounds. The Constitutional Council upheld the decision, effectively excluding opposition leaders including Sonko from standing as candidates.The July 2022 elections were the first under an electoral code change that increased the number of single-member districts from 105 to 112 and decreased the number of seats elected under a national-level proportional system from 60 to 53.Local elections were held in January 2022 after having been repeatedly delayed since 2019. The delays created logistical problems that negatively impacted voter registration and the number of first-time voters. Opposition candidates won in key cities.",3,"The National Autonomous Electoral Commission (CENA) administers elections. Although the CENA is nominally independent, its members are appointed by the president. The opposition criticized the government for making important changes ahead of the 2017 legislative balloting, including the introduction of a new biometric voting system, without engaging in dialogue or building political consensus.  An electoral law passed in 2018 requires all aspiring presidential candidates to collect signatures from at least 0.8 percent of the overall electorate before their names could appear on the ballot, and all groups presenting National Assembly lists to obtain signatures from 0.5 percent of voters in at least seven regions. Of the 27 candidates who submitted the required signatures prior to the 2019 presidential election, only 5 were approved by the Constitutional Council. That June, a European Union (EU) election observation mission said the controversial requirement could pose “serious political and organizational problems” in upcoming local elections. In April 2021, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice found that the provision violated the right to free participation in elections and ordered Senegal to “remove all obstacles” within six months. Despite the ECOWAS ruling and further domestic legal challenges, the government proceeded with the electoral sponsorship requirement for the July 2022 elections.In May 2019, opposition parties and the Sall administration entered a national dialogue aimed at resolving voter-roll concerns and reviewing the overarching voting process, but major disagreements persisted.",3
serbia,"The president is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. Incumbent president Aleksandar Vučić won reelection to a second term in April 2022 with 58.6 percent of the vote in a field of eight candidates.The campaign was characterized by media bias and allegations of misuse of public resources. President Vučić’s media engagement as both head of state and SNS leader afforded him unparalleled public exposure, and lacked clear differentiation between his roles. Altogether, Vučić received 74 percent of the media time designated for all presidential candidates.The prime minister is elected by the parliament. Since 2017, Ana Brnabić, a former local government minister, has served in the role. Brnabić was reelected prime minister in October 2022, following a six-month delay in forming a government after the April elections.",2,"The National Assembly is a unicameral, 250-seat legislature whose deputies are elected to four-year terms under a system of proportional representation with a single nationwide constituency. Regular parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held in 2024; however, in February 2022, President Vučić dissolved the parliament and called for early parliamentary elections to take place in April alongside the planned presidential and local elections.Though the 2022 parliamentary elections were characterized by significant polarization between the ruling government and the opposition, all political parties participated in the polls, including the opposition parties that boycotted the 2020 parliamentary election. Seven electoral lists crossed the three percent electoral threshold to enter the parliament, increasing the body’s pluralism following the 2020 boycott. Four ethnic minority lists, which did not have to surpass the parliamentary threshold to attain representation, also entered the parliament. The incumbent SNS-led coalition won 44.3 percent of vote, taking 120 seats but losing its majority. After six months of negotiations, the SNS formed a government with its long-standing coalition partner, the SPS, in October. Voter turnout was 58.6 percent, the largest turnout since the 2008 elections. Local elections were also held in 13 locations in April; SNS-led coalitions won the most votes in all 13 municipalities. Observers reported numerous irregularities during the campaign and on election day. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) noted in its final election observation report released in August that a “number of shortcomings resulted in an uneven playing field, favoring the incumbents.” During the campaign, essential freedoms were generally respected, but the effect of disproportionately high media access afforded to progovernment parties; pressure on public sector employees and minority and socio-economically at-risk residents, particularly the Romany population, to support the incumbents; notable campaign finance inconsistencies; and the abuse of administrative resources resulted in an unequal electoral environment for candidates, and provided undue advantages to the SNS. Parallel voter lists were used to track voters during the poll; vote buying was also reported.",2,"Electoral laws largely correspond to international standards, but aspects of the electoral process are poorly regulated, and implementation of existing rules is flawed in some respects. In its report on the 2022 elections, the ODIHR noted persistent concerns over the lack of autonomy and efficacy of the Regulatory Body for Electronic Media (REM), administrative resource misuse and voter coercion, campaign finance transparency, and voter list availability. In 2021, members of the European Parliament started mediating interparty talks on election conditions between the government and the opposition, resulting in presidential and parliamentary electoral framework changes adopted in February 2022. Among other things, the amendments include provisions for increasing opposition representation in election commissions; expanding the dispute resolution period; and modifying campaign media coverage regulations. While generally well-received, the changes were widely assessed to have been limited and adopted too close to the April elections to be effective. Electoral management—and in particular the work of independent state institutions, namely the REM and the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA)—is often nontransparent; laws, mechanisms, and regulations regarding campaign finance, compliance with related financial restrictions, candidates’ use of their own funds, and the public hearing of electoral challenges are either opaque or lacking.",2

In late 2019, Faure was endorsed by the PL, renamed United Seychelles (US), to contest the October 2020 presidential election. Faure lost to Seychelles Democratic Alliance (LDS) candidate Wavel Ramkalawan.

The APC sued over the proposed shift in late November, though no ruling was issued by year’s end.The APC also criticized the ECSL’s September-to-October 2022 voting registration exercise and the November verification process, saying that its supporters were being disenfranchised. Local stakeholders, meanwhile, reported that the verification process was marred by administrative difficulties. Some 257,000 voters were removed from the roll because entries were purportedly duplicated; the APC criticized their removal as opaque in nature and called for an audit in December. ",3
singapore,"The government is led by a prime minister and cabinet formed by the party that controls Parliament. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of the PAP has been in power since 2004. While polling-day procedures are generally free of irregularities, numerous structural factors that favor the PAP impede viable electoral competition.The president, whose role is largely ceremonial, is elected by popular vote for six-year terms, and a special committee is empowered to vet candidates. None of Singapore’s three main ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays, and Indians or others) may be excluded from the presidency for more than five consecutive terms, and presidential candidates from the private sector, as opposed to senior officials with at least three years of service, must have experience leading a company with at least S$500 million (US$359 million) in shareholder equity.

The Parliament elected that July consequently included 14 members from single-member constituencies and 79 members from Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). The top-polling party in each GRC wins all of its four to five seats, which has historically bolstered the PAP’s majority. As many as nine additional, nonpartisan members can be appointed by the president, and a maximum of another 12 can come from a national compensatory list meant to ensure a minimum of opposition representation. Members serve five-year terms, with the exception of appointed members, who serve for two and a half years.In the 2020 elections, the PAP secured 61.2 percent of the popular vote and 83 of the 93 directly elected seats. The largest opposition group, the Workers’ Party, won 10 seats and received 2 compensatory seats to achieve the minimum of 12 for the opposition.Elections are largely free of fraud or other irregularities but are unfair due to the advantages enjoyed by the PAP, including a progovernment media sector, the GRC system, high financial barriers to electoral candidacy, and legal restrictions on free speech.",2,"Singapore lacks an independent election commission; the country’s Elections Department (ELD) is a government body attached to the Prime Minister’s Office. The secretary to the prime minister is the head of the EBRC, which reviews and redraws constituency boundaries. In the past, the PAP-controlled boundaries process has ensured an advantage for the party. The electoral districts for the 2020 elections were announced in mid-March, just four months before the polls were held.

solomon-islands,"The prime minister, who serves as the head of government, is elected by the National Parliament. Irregularities are frequent in the run-up to prime ministerial elections, known as “second elections.” Leading contenders usually separate into camps in Honiara’s major hotels and seek the support of other members of Parliament with promises of cash or ministerial portfolios. Following the 2019 elections, Manasseh Sogavare won a fourth nonconsecutive term as prime minister. Solomon Islands Democratic Party (SIDP) leader Matthew Wale attempted to stop Sogavare’s selection, saying that he had relaunched the Ownership, Unity, and Responsibility Party (OUR Party) too late, failing to meet the requirement that prime ministerial candidates maintain party membership. The High Court ruled Sogavare’s election lawful. The National Parliament selects a governor general to represent the British monarch as head of state for five-year terms.

However, the Constitutional Court upheld a court challenge by the opposition requiring the elections to be held by the originally scheduled date. The DA also initiated an unsuccessful court challenge to prevent the ANC from fielding candidates after the deadline, which they claimed was only allowed because of bias within the IEC.In 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled that electoral laws preventing individuals from contesting legislative elections without belonging to a political party were unconstitutional.

The SAF detained civilian prime minister Abdulla Hamdok and several other government ministers and advisors. On November 11, 2021, al-Burhan reconstituted the Sovereign Council, with himself as chair, including old members, new members, and Juba Peace Agreement (JPA) signatories in the body. On November 21, Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister after signing an agreement with al-Burhan that provided for the release of political detainees, a new technocratic government, and the restructuring of the Empowerment Removal Committee (ERC). However, it also retains the Sovereign Council’s “oversight” role in government and excluded the civilian political coalition called the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) from participating in the Sovereign Council.

tanzania,"The president is elected by direct popular vote for up to two five-year terms. In the event of the president’s death, the vice president assumes the post and completes their predecessor’s term. Samia Suluhu Hassan, vice president since 2015, became chief executive in March 2021 after President John Magufuli died. In September 2021, she announced her plans to run in 2025.The late president won the October 2020 presidential election with 84.5 percent of the vote in a contest that was markedly less free and fair than the 2015 election. The 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud and vote-rigging, threats of violence against opposition figures, the use of force by police against opposition demonstrators, the suspension of media outlets and social media, the obstruction and dispersal of opposition candidate Tundu Lissu’s rallies, and other irregularities. International and local observers were denied accreditation, as were many international media outlets. Turnout stood at 50 percent. Opposition parties rejected the results and called for protests but organizers were arrested and a widespread protest movement never emerged. Lissu fled to Belgium in November 2020 with assistance from several European governments and the United States.The semiautonomous region of Zanzibar elects its own president, who serves no more than two five-year terms. The 2020 Zanzibar presidential poll, held concurrently with the October general elections, was also marred in controversy.

The ACT-Wazalendo rejected the results. Before the polls opened, the regime mobilized the army to Zanzibar; Hamad was detained by police and remained in custody during the election period. The army and police were accused of firing into a crowd days before the election, killing several people; members of the crowd were reportedly attempting to stop the delivery of ballots suspected to be fraudulent. Reports of further detentions, killings, and torture emerged after the election. The ACT-Wazalendo agreed to form a unity government in Zanzibar that November, with Hamad becoming vice president. The development prompted co-optation accusations.",1,"Legislative authority lies with a unicameral, 393-seat National Assembly (the Bunge) whose members serve five-year terms.

The attorney general holds an ex officio seat. Unlike the 2015 poll, the 2020 legislative election was marred by extensive fraud and intimidation allegations. Widespread interference in nomination processes, both bureaucratic and physical, led to around 30 opposition candidates being kept off the ballot. Numerous legislative and local government candidates were detained during the campaign period, including high-profile Chadema lawmakers. On election day, opposition politicians complained of election interference and fraud; 97 percent of the directly elected seats went to the CCM, which substantially increased its majority. The opposition was granted a small number of women’s special seats in line with their share of the vote. Chadema refused to take those seats but a group of 19 female Chadema legislators defected, were seated in the legislature, and were then formally expelled from the party. Several women took their seats upon being released from police custody, prompting speculation of coercion. Members of Zanzibar’s 85-seat House of Representatives serve five-year terms and are installed through a mix of direct elections and appointments. The 2015 legislative elections were annulled along with the concurrent Zanzibari presidential vote, and an opposition boycott of the 2016 rerun left the CCM with full control of the regional legislature.

The Tanzanian president appoints NEC members. Magufuli’s appointment of a former CCM candidate as NEC director in 2019 was criticized by the Chadema and ACT-Wazalendo leaders. The NEC was criticized for poor administration of voter-registration processes ahead of the 2020 elections, and it oversaw the rejection of dozens of legislative and local candidates on technicalities. The NEC also ordered the temporary suspension of Lissu’s presidential campaign, saying Lissu had used incendiary language. Opposition parties accused the NEC of complicity in widespread ballot stuffing and use of “ghost voters” to benefit the CCM. The NEC did not release the full results of local government or legislative elections in 2020.Opposition parties and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have called for constitutional reform, saying the current constitution favors the ruling CCM. While the Hassan administration initially resisted those calls, a CCM official went on to say that the party “insists” on a new constitution in a June 2022 statement. In its October report, a government-appointed task force supported the formation of an independent electoral body but noted public disagreements over constitutional reform.The Zanzibari president appoints most ZEC members, though the opposition nominates two of the seven members. Some observers criticized then president Ali Mohamed Shein’s 2018 appointees, calling them CCM partisans.

thailand,"Thailand is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who serves as head of state. Although the monarchy has limited formal power, the king has significant influence over Thai politics and specifically over the military.The constitution, which was developed by a committee appointed by the military’s National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), was approved in a tightly controlled 2016 referendum. According to the charter, the prime minister is selected by a majority vote of the combined 500-seat elected House of Representatives and the 250-seat Senate, whose members are entirely appointed by the military.The promilitary Palang Pracharat Party (PPP), which won only 115 lower-house seats in the 2019 elections, nominated incumbent prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to retain his position. In 2014, as army chief, Prayuth had staged a coup against the democratically elected government and declared himself prime minister. Prayuth retained his post in 2019 through the support of a promilitary bloc in the lower house and votes from 249 military-appointed senators. Prayuth was suspended as prime minister in August 2022 while the Constitutional Court considered a petition brought by the opposition Pheu Thai Party (PTP); the PTP argued that by declaring himself prime minister in 2014, Prayuth had exceeded the constitutionally stipulated eight-year term limit. In late September 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled that Prayuth’s term began in 2017 when Thailand promulgated its current constitution, allowing him to return to office.",0,"Under the military-drafted constitution, the bicameral National Assembly consists of the 250-seat Senate, whose members are appointed to five-year terms by the military, and the 500-seat House of Representatives. In 2019, after five years of postponements, a House of Representatives election was contested by 77 political parties, most of which fell into promilitary or antimilitary camps. The campaign period was marred by political repression, media censorship, unequal media access, and a lack of independent and impartial oversight from the Election Commission of Thailand (ECT). The results were tainted by irregularities, with ballots “lost” and initial vote tallies changed. Additionally, the formula for distributing party seats was altered after the election to redistribute seats won by opposition parties to military-aligned parties. This electoral manipulation granted promilitary parties a supermajority in the lower house.The Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL), an international election monitoring body, was permitted to observe the election; two domestic organizations, P-Net and We Watch, were also granted permission. All three experienced severely restricted access to the polls and voting procedures. Under a 2021 constitutional amendment, 400 lower-house members will be directly elected to four-year terms in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote in future elections. Another 100 members will be elected in one nationwide constituency via party-list proportional representation. This “two-ballot” system favors larger parties more capable of crossing the voting threshold to win party-list seats. In 2020, Thailand held its first provincial elections since the 2014 coup. Candidates associated with locally dominant groups fared well, while those linked to the reform movement made few gains. Municipal elections and subdistrict contests were held in 2021. ANFREL called the subdistrict elections smooth but noted the occurrence of vote buying.",1,"The military-drafted 2017 constitution was designed to weaken political parties and elected officials while strengthening unelected institutions. All 250 senators were appointed by the military in 2019. The prime minister is selected through a combined vote of both houses, granting the unelected Senate a powerful role in the selection process. The current unelected Senate’s five-year term will end in 2024, a full year after the next House of Representatives is elected. This design grants the military significant political power to form the next government even if it loses the popular vote in the 2023 election by a wide margin.The 2019 elections were overseen by the ECT, whose members were appointed by the military. Throughout the electoral process, the ECT was criticized for its lack of independence and willingness to intervene on behalf of the military and promilitary parties. For instance, the ECT’s postelection change of the seat distribution formula reassigned seats won by the opposition to military-aligned parties, which subsequently voted with the PPP and the Senate to retain Prayuth as prime minister.",0

Turnout stood at 77.3 percent in the first round and 75.2 percent in the second. Ramos-Horta was supported by Xanana Gusmão of the CNRT.The leader of the majority party or coalition in Parliament becomes prime minister and serves as head of government. In June 2018, former independence fighter and former president José Maria Vasconcelos, popularly known as Taur Matan Ruak, was sworn in as prime minister. He remained in that post when Fretilin, the People’s Liberation Party (PLP), and the Party for the Enhancement of Timorese National Unity (KHUNTO) formed a governing coalition in May 2020.",4,"Members of the 65-seat, unicameral Parliament are directly elected and serve five-year terms. Following a minority government’s failure to pass a budget, the president dissolved Parliament in January 2018. Polls were held that May. The sitting opposition parties—the CNRT, KHUNTO, and the PLP—formed the Change for Progress Alliance (AMP) coalition and won an outright majority of 34 seats. Fretilin won 23, the Democratic Party won 5, and the Democratic Development Front won 3. European Union (EU) observers called elections “transparent, well-managed and credible.” Polls were generally peaceful and orderly, despite a few violent incidents during the campaign period.A new governing coalition of the PLP, KHUNTO, and Fretilin was formed in May 2020, three months after Parliament failed to approve a budget. The CNRT triggered that failure by abstaining but was ultimately unable to muster a new coalition of its own.",4,EU observers present for the 2022 presidential election noted that the National Election Commission (CNE) benefited from legal changes introduced after the last parliamentary election. The observers also reported that local stakeholders viewed the CNE and the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration as professional and independent.Provisions governing elections are found across several pieces of legislation. EU observers reported that some of these laws “are not organised coherently” and that some of the framework is ambiguous in practice.,3
togo,"The president, who serves as head of state and holds most executive power, is elected for five-year terms. The president appoints the prime minister, who serves as head of government. Term limits were eliminated in 2002, then restored through a constitutional amendment in 2019; they did not apply retroactively, meaning Faure Gnassingbé could seek two additional terms. A second-round runoff can be held if no candidate wins a first-round majority. Gnassingbé—initially installed as president by the military in 2005 after his father’s death—secured a fourth term in 2020, ostensibly with 71 percent of the vote. Permits for domestic civil society groups to observe the polls were denied or revoked and representatives of the US-based National Democratic Institute were expelled before the election. A small number of observers from the African Union (AU) and ECOWAS were granted entry and produced largely uncritical reports. The runner-up, former prime minister Agbeyome Kodjo of the opposition Patriotic Movement for Democracy and Development, was credited with 19 percent of the vote. He and other opposition members alleged that the election was stolen, accusing the government of using fake polling stations and stuffing ballot boxes. Kodjo and others were arrested for asserting that he was the legitimate president; he was later released and is currently living in exile. In March 2022, the ECOWAS Court of Justice ruled that Kodjo’s arrest and detention was arbitrary and illegal.",1,"The constitution calls for a bicameral legislature, but the Senate has never been established. Members of the 91-seat National Assembly, which exercises all legislative powers, are elected for five-year terms through proportional representation in multimember districts. In the 2018 elections, the main opposition parties led a boycott, citing several unmet demands regarding constitutional and electoral reform. Gnassingbé’s Union for the Republic (UNIR) won 59 seats. The Union of Forces for Change (UFC), which led the opposition before aligning itself with the government in 2010, won 7. AU and ECOWAS observers said the elections had been held “properly” in a “calm environment,” though opposition protests had been violently suppressed ahead of polling day and turnout was low in opposition-leaning areas. The UNIR won over 60 percent of council seats contested in 2019, in what were the first local polls since 1987. Regional elections scheduled for 2021 were postponed. In March 2022, the National Assembly passed a law establishing territorial authorities in preparation for 2023 elections. Elected regional councilors and municipal officials will elect two-thirds of the Senate; the president will appoint the remainder.",2,"Elections are organized and supervised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), whose membership by law should be balanced with appointments by the ruling party and the opposition. However, only 2 of the 19 members were from the opposition for the 2020 election. Among other irregularities on election day, opposition members were reportedly denied access to some polling places to monitor the vote, and the CENI refused to publish detailed results for each precinct. The Constitutional Court, responsible for verifying election results, is stacked with close allies of Gnassingbé.Prominent civil society groups and major opposition parties have called for a reliable electoral register, fairly apportioned legislative districts, a reorganized CENI, a more independent Constitutional Court, and the announcement of precinct-based election results.",1
tonga,"Though the monarch is no longer the chief executive authority, he retains significant powers, including the ability to veto legislation and dissolve the parliament.

tunisia,"The 2014 constitution laid out a semipresidential system in which a popularly elected president served as head of state and exercised circumscribed powers, while the majority party in the parliament selected a prime minister, who served as head of government. The president was directly elected for up to two five-year terms.The last presidential election held under the 2014 constitution took place in October 2019, following the death of President Beji Caid Essebsi that July. Kaïs Saïed, an independent candidate and former constitutional law professor, won a runoff against businessman and media owner Nabil Karoui with 73 percent of the vote. Local observers concluded that the election was generally competitive and credible, but raised some concerns about Karoui’s inability to campaign while in prison.Claiming emergency authority under Article 80 of the 2014 constitution, President Saïed took the unilateral decision to dismiss Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi in July 2021, and in October 2021 he installed a new government headed by Prime Minister Najla Bouden without parliamentary approval. Bouden remained prime minister during 2022. Under the new constitution adopted in July 2022, the prime minister and cabinet are appointed and dismissed by the president and responsible to him rather than to the parliament. The presidential term limit remained in place.",3,"Tunisia’s 2014 constitution established a unicameral parliament, the 217-seat Assembly of the Representatives of the People (ARP); 199 members were directly elected in domestic multimember constituencies, while 18 represented multimember constituencies abroad via a party-list system. All members served five-year terms.The last legislative elections under the old constitution took place in October 2019. International and national observers declared the balloting to be generally competitive and credible. The Islamist party Ennahda placed first with 52 seats, Karoui’s Qalb Tounes (Heart of Tunisia) party took 38 seats, the progressive Democratic Current took 22, and Al-Karama (Dignity) Coalition took 21. The remaining seats were won by 11 other parties and 17 independent candidates.In July 2021, President Saïed unilaterally suspended the parliament and revoked lawmakers’ legal immunity, and several members later faced house arrest or detention and trials in military courts. Saïed formally dissolved the body in March 2022, after a majority of legislators met online and attempted to reverse several of the president’s emergency measures. In the fall of 2022, Saïed announced legislative elections scheduled to begin in late December under a new constitution and electoral law. The new parliament would have 161 members elected in single-member constituencies, including 10 representing Tunisians living abroad. Due in large part to onerous candidacy restrictions and a boycott led by major opposition parties, turnout in the first round of voting was extremely low at just 11 percent. Only 1,058 candidates campaigned for office—a steep drop-off from prior legislative elections. Ten constituencies attracted only one approved candidate, and seven of the seats for expatriate voters had no candidates at all. Following the first round of voting, just 21 candidates were declared as winners, and a second round was scheduled to take place in January 2023. As of December 28, at least 57 appeals of the initial results had been submitted to the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE). The new constitution envisioned the creation of a second legislative chamber, the indirectly elected National Council of Regions and Districts, but this body had yet to be formed at the end of 2022.",1,"From the 2011 revolution through the last elections under the 2014 constitution in 2019, the ISIE’s supervision of parliamentary and presidential balloting was well regarded by Tunisian and international observers, and the authority itself was seen as politically independent. In May 2022, Saïed replaced the ISIE’s executive committee, and the newly appointed body was tasked with organizing the referendum on his draft constitution in July. Watchdog groups including I Watch and Mourakiboun criticized the ISIE’s handling of the referendum, citing computational errors and a lack of transparency regarding the release of station-level results. The referendum was also marred by a low turnout of some 31 percent and complaints that opponents of the new charter were unable to campaign freely. The new constitution left the ISIE open to greater presidential interference in its composition, as it removed a clause from the 2014 constitution that stipulated the process by which ISIE members must be appointed, meaning the process could be set through ordinary legislation or presidential decrees. Saïed issued a new electoral law by decree in September 2022, setting the stage for the parliamentary elections that began in December. In addition to replacing the proportional-representation system with voting in single-member districts, the law imposed new requirements on candidates. For example, each potential candidate must collect 400 signatures of registered voters who do not endorse any other candidate. The decree also eliminated public funding for campaigns, removed a ceiling on private fundraising, barred anyone ever charged with a legal violation from candidacy, and revoked prior laws promoting gender parity and youth representation on electoral lists. Finally, the decree ramped up punishments for vaguely defined “electoral crimes,” including receiving illegal donations or “intentionally exploiting another candidate’s honor or familial or geographic affiliation.”",2
turkey,"In 2018, Turkey instituted a presidential system of government that makes the president the chief national authority and grants the office sweeping executive powers. The president is directly elected for up to two five-year terms but is eligible to run for a third term in the event of early elections. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan served as prime minister from 2003 to 2014, and as president since then. Because Erdoğan’s first term ended early due to the 2017 referendum, he is eligible to run for a third term in 2023, which, if secured, would last until 2028.Turkey’s 2018 general elections were held under a state of emergency that had been in place since a 2016 coup attempt. Erdoğan, who leads the AKP, won the presidential race with 52.6 percent of the vote in the first round. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) criticized the election, reporting that electoral regulators often deferred to the ruling AKP, that state-run media favored the AKP in its coverage, and that Erdoğan repeatedly accused legitimate political opponents of supporting terrorism during the campaign.",2,"The unicameral Grand National Assembly has 600 seats.

The opposition Nation’s Alliance, led by the CHP and including the İyi Party (IP) and two smaller parties, won 34 percent of the vote and took 189 seats. The pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP) won 11 percent of the vote, gaining 67 seats.The OSCE described the 2018 elections as marred by the AKP’s misuse of state resources to gain an electoral advantage and noted that the opposition claimed that last-minute changes to electoral laws and failure to follow standard procedures for the selection of polling locations benefitted the ruling party. Reports of irregularities such as proxy voting were prevalent in the southeast, the HDP’s stronghold.",2,"The judges of the Supreme Electoral Council (YSK), who oversee all voting procedures, are appointed by AKP-dominated judicial bodies and often defer to the AKP in their decisions. A new electoral law passed in March 2022 lowered the parliamentary entry threshold from 10 percent to 7 percent and changed the way parliamentary seats are distributed among party alliances. Opposition parties criticized the threshold changes as an attempt by the AKP to scuttle a broad opposition alliance, saying the lower threshold was designed to encourage smaller parties to break from a unified opposition bloc. The new law modified procedures for the selection of judges who oversee elections and control vote-counting process. Previously, the top-ranking judge in a district would select the judges responsible for any challenges to the vote count; the new law prescribes that those judges be selected in a draw, making it more likely that AKP-aligned judges appointed in recent years would oversee the processes. The law also exempted the president from rules that ban ministers from using state resources for their campaigns.",1

Turnout stood at 59 percent.The campaign period, which began in late 2020, was marred by repression and violence, though polling day itself was calm besides a military presence in Kampala. Wine, who had been arrested several times in 2020, was placed under house arrest after casting his ballot, though the High Court of Kampala ordered his release later in January 2021. Leading up to the election, authorities selectively used COVID-19 restrictions to violently disperse opposition rallies and arrest journalists, while NRM events were allowed to proceed; police killed over 50 people. During the election, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) ordered a five-day internet blackout. Internet access was largely restored by February 2021. Politically-motivated disappearances and reports of torture of opposition supporters in detention increased in the months after the election.Few observers monitored the vote, and both foreign and domestic accreditation requests to observe the elections were denied. Wine accused the government of stuffing ballot boxes and filed a legal challenge that he later withdrew.

The Poroshenko bloc, which had rebranded as European Solidarity, took 25 seats. The Opposition Platform–For Life (OPZZh) grouping took 43 seats, Fatherland 26, and the Voice Party 20.The elections were deemed generally competitive and credible, despite some problems.

A plurality of elected local councillors nationwide were independent candidates. Servant of the People was largely unsuccessful when contesting the mayoralties of larger cities, though it maintained representation on most city councils.

That December, the new parliament adopted an electoral code that partially implemented a proportional-representation voting system, with open party lists for both parliamentary and local elections. Zelenskyy enacted it at the end of that year.The 2020 local elections were held under the new code, though it was modified a number of times that year; among other changes, internally displaced persons (IDPs) who lacked documentation for their current place of residence were allowed to vote in local elections, helping to resolve one criticism of the 2019 national polls. The TVK decided not to conduct local elections in 18 communities in the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions of eastern Ukraine, located close to the contact line with noncontrolled territories. The decision affected 475,000 voters, who continued to be governed by military-civil administrations appointed directly by the president.

While the electoral college has expanded, and overseas voting was permitted for the first time in 2015, there is no public accountability for the procedures by which the rulers of each emirate draw up the lists of eligible voters. The geographical allocation of FNC seats results in significant overrepresentation for the smaller emirates.",0
united-states,"The president, who serves as both head of state and head of government, is elected for up to two four-year terms. Presidential elections are decided by an Electoral College, with electors apportioned to each state based on the size of its congressional representation. In most cases, all of the electors in a particular state cast their ballots for the candidate who won the statewide popular vote, regardless of the margin. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, have chosen to divide their electoral votes between the candidates based on their popular-vote performance in each congressional district.In the 2020 election, Biden, the Democratic Party nominee, won 306 Electoral College votes, leaving Trump, the Republican incumbent, with 232. Biden defeated Trump by more than seven million votes, or approximately 4.4 percentage points, in the national popular balloting. Turnout was the highest recorded in more than a century, with roughly two-thirds of the eligible population casting a ballot.The COVID-19 pandemic compelled many states to increase access to early and mail-in voting, partly to help prevent dangerous crowding at polling sites. This led to a series of legal battles, with the Trump campaign and other Republican litigants generally arguing against the changes and claiming that they would open the door to fraud. The balloting itself unfolded with few significant disruptions, though existing obstacles to voting—such as strict voter-identification requirements and inadequate numbers of polling sites—remained a factor. Meanwhile, the federal government assisted states in safeguarding ballots and computer networks against foreign and other illegal interference, while social media companies made greater efforts to thwart election-related disinformation campaigns by foreign actors on their platforms. These measures were generally deemed successful.Rejecting a vote-tabulation process that was lauded by observers as transparent and professional, in the weeks after the election Trump refused to concede, continued to allege fraud, and openly pressured election officials in pivotal states to make decisions that would support his claims regardless of the facts and the law. During the counting and certification process, state election workers reported intimidation and death threats. A raft of lawsuits by the Trump campaign and its allies were almost universally dismissed by state and federal courts. Evidence of large-scale fraud was nonexistent, but the Trump camp’s disinformation, complemented by the reluctance of leading Republicans to explicitly acknowledge Biden as the president-elect, helped to convince many Trump supporters that voter fraud was widespread and Biden was not the rightful winner.Evidence later emerged regarding last-ditch efforts to overturn the results, including machinations by Trump and allied officials or lawyers to involve the Justice Department and other government agencies in supporting the president’s fraud claims, to enlist then vice president Mike Pence in blocking certification of Biden’s victory, and to work with Republican activists to put forward illegitimate pro-Trump slates of electors in states that Biden won.Trump administration officials and allies also encouraged resistance to Biden’s victory from voters and citizen groups, culminating on January 6, 2021, when several thousand Trump supporters assembled near the White House for a “Save America” rally. Following inflammatory speeches by Trump and others, the crowd converged on the US Capitol as the counting of the Electoral College ballots proceeded. Upon encountering an inadequate deployment of police, the group turned violent, using both concealed and improvised weapons to break through barricades, assault police officers, and forcibly enter the Capitol, where intruders searched for lawmakers, vandalized offices, and occupied the Senate chamber as members were evacuated. The group was dispersed after several hours, following the delayed arrival of the National Guard. In all, seven people died in connection with the attack, including a policeman who suffered strokes after clashing with the mob and a rioter who was shot by police near the House chamber. Nearly 140 police officers were injured, as were scores of civilians. Among Republicans, a divide emerged in the weeks after the election between state officials involved in administering the balloting, who generally defended the fairness of the process and the accuracy of the results, and many members of Congress, who gave credence to Trump’s claims and cast doubt on Biden’s victory. When Congress reconvened late on January 6 to complete the Electoral College count, just eight senators lodged objections to state results, but 139 of the 211 Republicans in the House of Representatives at the time supported baseless objections to the vote counts in at least one state. Biden’s inauguration proceeded without incident on January 20.The events of January 6 prompted several institutional responses. The following week, the House voted to impeach Trump on the charge of incitement of insurrection, with 10 Republicans joining all 222 Democrats to approve the measure. The ensuing Senate trial concluded in February with Trump’s acquittal, as only 57 of the required 67 senators, including seven Republicans, voted to convict. In July 2021, a House select committee was formed to investigate the January 6 attack; only two Republican House members agreed to join. The select committee defined its mandate broadly, aiming to clarify both the events of January 6 and the wider efforts to overturn the election results.The January 6 committee interviewed scores of witnesses, issued an array of subpoenas for documents and testimony by Trump administration officials and allies, and between June and October 2022 held public hearings featuring live testimony and recorded depositions. The investigation culminated in a report released in December 2022, which assigned primary responsibility for the violence to Trump and referred him to the Justice Department for possible prosecution on charges that included inciting insurrection and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Republican critics derided the investigation as a partisan smear campaign, and Trump, his top political allies, and high-ranking Republican Party officials refused to comply with subpoenas. The House voted to hold four nonrespondents in contempt of Congress; two were indicted, and one of the two, prominent Trump adviser Steve Bannon, received a four-month jail sentence in October, with an appeal pending. Other investigations of Trump’s postelection activity accelerated during 2022, including a special grand jury probe of efforts to pressure Georgia officials to alter the state’s election results. In November, US attorney general Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to examine Trump’s role in the planning of the January 6 violence, as well as any criminal liability related to a cache of classified government documents that were recovered in an August raid on his Florida estate. Trump and his allies continued to dismiss all such investigations as political persecution, even as his repeated attempts to block the inquiries in court largely failed.",3,"Elections for the bicameral Congress are generally free and competitive. The House of Representatives consists of 435 members serving two-year terms. The Senate consists of 100 members—two from each of the 50 states—serving six-year terms, with one-third coming up for election every two years. All national legislators are elected directly by voters in the districts or states that they represent.The capital district, Puerto Rico, and four overseas US territories are each represented by an elected delegate in the House who can perform most legislative functions but cannot participate in floor votes.Midterm elections were held in November 2022 and resulted in a change of control of the House of Representatives, while the Senate remained under Democratic control. Republicans gained nine House seats, giving them a majority of 222 to the Democrats’ 213. Following a runoff Senate election in Georgia in December, Democrats held 48 Senate seats, and there were two independent senators who generally vote with the Democrats, giving them control of the chamber; one other senator elected as a Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, shifted to independent status following the election. Turnout was approximately 47 percent of eligible voters, nearly matching the relatively high figure from the 2018 midterms.There were no serious accusations of result-altering fraud in any race in 2022, and most losing candidates quickly conceded, including many of the hundreds of Trump-aligned Republican candidates who continued to deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential results.",4,"The electoral framework is generally fair, though it is subject to some partisan manipulation. The borders of House districts, which must remain roughly equal in population, are redrawn regularly—typically after each decennial census. In the practice known as partisan gerrymandering, House districts, and those for state legislatures, are crafted to maximize the advantage of the party in power in a given state. The redistricting system varies by state, but in most cases it is overseen by elected officials, and observers have expressed alarm at the growing strategic and technical sophistication of partisan efforts to control redistricting processes and redraw electoral maps. Historically, gerrymandering has also been used as a tool of racial disenfranchisement, specifically targeting Black voters, as well as Hispanic and Native American populations. The Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 generally prohibits racially discriminatory voting rules, and racial gerrymandering has been subject to reversal by federal courts, but it remains a problem in practice. In February 2022, the Supreme Court allowed Alabama to implement a district map that had been rejected as a racial gerrymander by a lower court; similarly controversial maps in several other states were subsequently upheld by federal judges.In 2019 the Supreme Court ruled that the federal judiciary has no authority to prevent state politicians from drawing districts to preserve or expand their party’s power. However, some state courts have struck down partisan-gerrymandered maps based on their own constitutions, and a handful of states have established independent bodies to manage redistricting in recent years. Following the finalization of the 2020 census results and corresponding reapportionment, state redistricting occurred in 2021 and 2022, leading to multiple legal battles over gerrymandered maps ahead of the 2022 midterms. Both major parties continued to engage in partisan gerrymandering, but Republicans had greater opportunity to redraw state-level maps because they controlled more state legislatures nationwide, and key maps favoring Democrats were successfully challenged in state courts.Some states have adopted strict voter-identification laws. These documentation requirements can disproportionately limit participation by poor, elderly, or racial minority voters; people with disabilities; and younger voters, especially college students. Proponents of such laws argue that they prevent voter fraud, despite research showing that fraud is extremely rare. Separately, the closure and consolidation of polling places in several states in recent years have been found to reduce turnout by people who are less able to travel to distant polling locations or wait in long lines.Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of his 2020 defeat and his promotion of false fraud claims spurred a new wave of state electoral legislation: between the beginning of 2021 and October 2022, 21 states—nearly all with Republican-controlled legislatures—had passed 42 new laws that made voting more difficult, with provisions including stricter voter-identification requirements; reduced eligibility for mail-in ballots; and limits on interactions at polling places, such as a ban on offering water to voters waiting in line. Other states, however, moved in the opposite direction, with 12 mostly Democratic-led states passing 19 laws intended to facilitate voting.An emerging concern since the 2020 election has been efforts by Trump-supporting election deniers to take control of election management authority in states that are closely contested in presidential elections; their opponents argue that such actors could facilitate the partisan subversion of legitimate presidential election outcomes in the future. In the 2022 elections, however, a series of election deniers were defeated in races for governor, attorney general, and secretary of state, a key election administration post, in crucial states such as Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada. Separately, a spending bill passed by Congress in December 2022 included reforms designed to minimize the possibility of a constitutional crisis arising from bad-faith interpretations of the ambiguously worded Electoral Count Act, an 1887 law governing congressional validation of the Electoral College votes from the states.Critics have argued that some components of the US constitution are undemocratic because they violate the principle that each citizen’s vote should carry equal weight. For example, the allocation of two Senate seats to each state regardless of size has meant that senators representing a minority of the population are often able to control the chamber. Because the Electoral College allocates votes to the states based on the size of their congressional delegations, it too is affected by the makeup of the Senate; this makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency while losing the national popular vote, an outcome that took place in the presidential elections of 2000 and 2016. Defenders of these systems argue that they are fundamental to the United States’ constitutional tradition and federal structure, which was designed in part to check the influence of more populous states.The six-member Federal Election Commission (FEC), whose membership is split between Democrats and Republicans, is tasked with enforcing federal campaign finance laws. Most enforcement actions require four votes, allowing partisan obstruction, and the body has been regarded as largely ineffective in recent years.",3
united-kingdom,"Executive power rests with the prime minister and cabinet, which must have the support of the House of Commons. The leader of the majority party or coalition usually becomes prime minister and appoints the cabinet. Boris Johnson resigned as Conservative leader in July 2022, triggering a leadership contest in the party. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss won and became prime minister in September but resigned in October, after 45 days in office. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak, who succeeded her as party leader and prime minister that month, remained in post at year’s end.The monarch is the ceremonial head of state. Queen Elizabeth II, who ascended to that position in 1952, died in September 2022.

Members of the unelected House of Lords, numbering 798 in September 2022, are appointed by the monarch. The body largely plays an oversight role in reviewing legislation passed by the House of Commons.In the December 2019 snap election, the Conservatives won 365 lower-house seats while the opposition Labour Party won 202. The Scottish National Party, which advocates for Scottish independence from the UK, won 47. Elections for some local councils and mayoralties in England, Scotland, and Wales took place in May 2022; Labour and the Liberal Democrats gained council seats, while the Conservatives sustained losses.Elections for the Northern Ireland Assembly’s 90 seats were also held in May 2022. In a historic result, the left-wing republican Sinn Féin became the Assembly’s largest party with 27 seats. The DUP won 25. The nonsectarian, liberal Alliance Party gained 9 seats, winning 17. Two independents and four parties won the remainder.",4,"The UK’s electoral framework is robust and well implemented. Parliament maintains a direct role in electoral management, notably through its involvement in the seat-boundary drawing process. However, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 will limit its future involvement. Parliament’s role was further eroded in March 2022, when the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022 repealed the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which had limited the prime minister’s ability to force a snap election.Under the Elections Act 2022, voters in England and Wales must show photo identification to vote in general elections and some local contests. The government said the law would ensure electoral integrity, but democracy advocacy groups, some members of Parliament (MPs), and the Electoral Commission (EC) strongly criticized it. In 2019, the Electoral Reform Society warned that voter-identification rules would disproportionately impact Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) voters. In a 2021 report, the EC noted that only four electoral-fraud convictions were recorded after the 2019 electoral calendar. Also in 2021, a House of Commons committee extrapolated that 1.1 million people would be discouraged from voting in a general election under the bill’s provisions.",4
uruguay,The president is directly elected to a five-year term and may hold nonconsecutive terms. The most recent general elections were held in two rounds in 2019. Luis Lacalle Pou and Beatriz Argimón of the center-right Partido Nacional (National Party) captured the presidency and vice presidency. The election took place peacefully and stakeholders accepted the results.,4,"The bicameral General Assembly consists of the 99-member Chamber of Representatives and the 30-member Senate, with all members directly elected for five-year terms. In the 2019 elections, the Broad Front (Frente Amplio) retained the most representatives but dropped from 50 seats in the Chamber of Representatives to 42, and from 15 to 13 seats in the Senate. The Partido Nacional built a predominantly center-right coalition with four other parties—the Partido Colorado (Colorado Party), the newly formed Cabildo Abierto (Open Cabildo), the Partido de la Gente (People’s Party), and the Partido Independiente (Independent Party)—that together won 57 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 17 seats in the Senate. The elections took place peacefully, and stakeholders accepted the results.",4,"Uruguay’s Electoral Court serves as the highest authority on elections and supervises the National Electoral Office, which oversees voter registration and has one office in each of the country’s regional departments.

Voting is compulsory.In September 2021, opponents of the controversial LUC—a broad-based public sector reform passed in 2020—gathered signatures to place numerous articles of the law before a national referendum for repeal. The signatures were verified by the Electoral Court that December. A referendum to repeal 135 provisions of the LUC was held in March 2022 and saw a voter turnout of 80 percent. The referendum failed to pass by a slim margin: those against repealing the law garnered approximately 49.9 percent of the vote share, while those in favor of repealing the law took approximately 48.8 percent.",4
uzbekistan,"The president, who holds most executive power, is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. Longtime prime minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev was named acting president through an irregular parliamentary process in 2016, after Islam Karimov, who had held the presidency since Uzbekistan’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, suffered a stroke and died. The constitution called for the Senate chairman to serve as acting president, but the chairman declined the post. Mirziyoyev won a special presidential election at the end of 2016, taking a reported 88.6 percent of the vote and defeating nominal challengers whose parties in some cases openly campaigned for the incumbent. Mirziyoyev was reelected in the October 2021 presidential elections with 80.1 percent of the vote. Though five candidates participated, the election was not competitive, and candidates avoided challenging or criticizing Mirziyoyev. Only registered parties may nominate candidates, and the parties of two individuals who intended to run were denied registration, preventing any opposition or independent candidates from contesting the election. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) election observation mission found the 2021 presidential elections to be neither fair nor free, noting a lack of meaningful engagement among candidates and an absence of transparent electoral procedures. OSCE observers also reported significant irregularities during the campaign and on election day, including ballot box stuffing in many polling stations, among other things. Wide-ranging constitutional reforms, including many that would strengthen the powers of the president, were proposed by the government and released for public feedback in June 2022. The proposed amendments include provisions that would extend presidential terms from five years to seven years. If adopted, the reforms would also allow President Mirziyoyev to serve two additional terms in office. The reforms had not been approved as of year’s end.",0,"Uzbekistan has a bicameral legislature. The lower house is composed of 150 seats, with members directly elected in individual constituencies. The 100-member upper house, or Senate, includes 84 members who are elected by regional councils and 16 who are appointed by the president. All members of the parliament serve five-year terms.The December 2019 lower house elections offered voters no meaningful choice, as all participating parties supported the government. The final results that followed January 2020 runoffs in 25 districts closely mirrored those from the previous lower house elections. The president’s party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (O’zLiDeP), maintained the largest share with 53 of 150 seats. Milliy Tiklanish (National Revival) won 36, the Adolat (Justice) Social Democratic Party won 24, and the People’s Democratic Party (XDP) won 22. The Ecological Party of Uzbekistan, which directly competed for the first time after previously having its seats automatically allocated, won the same total of 15 delegates that it had been granted in the previous parliament. OSCE election monitors noted numerous irregularities, including procedural violations, the use of multiple ballots by voters, and ballot-box stuffing.",0,"The electoral laws and framework are implemented in ways that offer no opportunities for independent political actors or parties to participate in elections at any level. Election management bodies are closely controlled by the government.Mirziyoyev has presided over some electoral reforms during his tenure. One set of reforms enacted in 2019 ended indirect representation for the Ecological Party, removed voting restrictions on those with past criminal convictions, and allowed voters to add their names to more than one party roll; these lists are required for political parties to participate in elections. In June 2022, the government proposed numerous constitutional reforms, including amendments that would drastically alter the existing legal and political status of Karakalpakstan, an autonomous republic within Uzbekistan. The draft amendments included provisions that would downgrade Karakalpakstan’s autonomous status, eliminating language identifying the republic as “sovereign” and removing its right to secede on the basis of a referendum. Mirziyoyev promised to withdraw the amendments that would have changed Karakalpakstan’s status in early July following mass protests in the region.",1

venezuela,"The president serves six-year terms and is not subject to term limits. Incumbent Nicolás Maduro was awarded a new term after winning the 2018 snap presidential election with nearly 68 percent of the vote, according to the government-controlled CNE. The poll featured a record-low turnout of 46 percent, leading opposition figures were barred from competing, and regional observers generally considered the process to be illegitimate.In January 2022, the opposition attempted to initiate a referendum to recall Maduro as president, as permitted by the constitution. However, the CNE gave petitioners just 12 hours to collect the signatures of at least 20 percent of registered voters, or about 4.2 million people. It then declared that the initiative had failed to meet that threshold, meaning a referendum could not proceed.In December 2022, the remaining members of the opposition-controlled National Assembly that had been elected in 2015 voted to formally dissolve an interim government it had created in January 2019 to challenge Maduro’s legitimacy. That government, headed by interim president Juan Guaidó, had received recognition from a number of democratic countries, but it was never able to displace Maduro or gain control over state institutions in practice.",0,"The unicameral National Assembly is popularly elected for five-year terms, using a mix of majoritarian and proportional-representation voting. The major opposition parties refused to participate in the 2020 National Assembly elections, citing the regime’s control over the CNE and recent attempts to replace the parties’ own leaders. A coalition led by the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won 253 of the assembly’s 277 seats, or 91 percent, according to official results. Meanwhile, the opposition-controlled National Assembly that had been elected in 2015 continued to operate and repeatedly voted to extend its term, notwithstanding its December 2022 decision to dissolve Guaidó’s interim government.Regional and local elections held in November 2021 were marred by the abuse of state resources and judicial interference in the government’s favor. A European Union (EU) election observation mission reported that turnout stood at 42.5 percent, the lowest in 25 years. Progovernment candidates won 20 out of 23 governorships and 212 out of 335 mayoralties. In late November, the TSJ ordered the CNE to hold a new gubernatorial election in Barinas State after finding that an opposition candidate who appeared to have won should have been disqualified. Nevertheless, another opposition candidate won the repeat election in January 2022. The EU observers were forced to leave the country in early December and were not permitted to return for the release of their final report in February 2022.",0,"The electoral system is heavily influenced by political manipulation and pro-PSUV institutional interference. The opposition had no influence over the slate of CNE commissioners selected ahead of the 2020 legislative elections; opposition members were granted two seats on the five-member panel announced in May 2021, due in part to civil society pressure, but the CNE retained a progovernment majority.Recent polls have been characterized by the disqualification of prominent opposition candidates, government abuse of public resources, uneven access to the state-dominated media, the diminished presence of international observers, and intimidation of state employees. In 2022, the opposition and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) warned that millions of eligible citizens were not on the voter rolls ahead of the 2024 presidential election and criticized the CNE for failing to facilitate registration, particularly for the growing number of Venezuelans living abroad.",0

yemen,"Under the existing constitution, the president is elected for seven-year terms. In 2011, after sustained pressure from the United States, the United Nations, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), longtime president Ali Abdullah Saleh signed a Saudi-brokered agreement that transferred his powers to then vice president Hadi in exchange for immunity from prosecution for his role in a violent crackdown on antigovernment protests. In 2012, Yemeni voters confirmed Hadi, who ran unopposed, as interim president with a two-year term. In 2014, the multiparty National Dialogue Conference (NDC), a months-long initiative in which more than 500 delegates aimed to reach agreement on Yemen’s political future, concluded with a plan to transform the country into a federated state of six regions. The NDC also extended Hadi’s term by one year so that the proposed reforms could be finalized in a new constitution.However, the constitutional drafting process and election schedule were thrown into disarray by the Houthis, who took over large swaths of the country, eventually occupying Sanaa in September 2014. The Houthis subsequently refused to evacuate the capital as part of a tentative power-sharing agreement, leading Hadi and his cabinet to flee into exile in early 2015. Meanwhile, the Houthis assumed control of state institutions in the areas they held. Hadi retained international recognition as president but had no clear mandate and little direct control over the country. In April 2022, the UN announced a truce agreement between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government. Later that month, Hadi announced that he was removing his vice president and relinquishing his own executive powers to an eight-member council, the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), that was elected by delegates in Riyadh under the auspices of the GCC.

In January 2014, the NDC declared that parliamentary elections would occur within nine months of a referendum on the new constitution then being drawn up. The constitutional drafting committee completed its work in January 2015, but due to the outbreak of the civil war and the Saudi-led intervention in March of that year, no vote has yet taken place.

Hichilema won 59 percent of the vote, while Lungu won 38.7 percent. Turnout was high, at 70.6 percent. Lungu initially questioned the results but later conceded; Hichilema assumed office later that month.The electoral period was marred by violence between PF and UPND members; the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) consequently ordered a temporary halt to campaigning in four provinces that June.

Southern African Development Community and European Union observers noted challenges including parties having difficulty accessing voter rolls, progovernment bias by state media, contested postal voting, the denial of the diaspora’s right to vote, reports of assisted voting, and intimidation meant to aid ZANU-PF.Vote-tallying irregularities and delays led to postelection tensions. The MDC-A leadership declared victory before the official results were released and accused ZANU-PF of attempting to rig the vote.
