afghanistan,"Media freedom is severely restricted under the Taliban. Media outlets are subject to intrusive monitoring and guidance by multiple Taliban organs, which are reinforced through threats and violence. The Afghan media sector has also suffered from the loss of state patronage, donor funding, and private-sector revenue. Many Afghan journalists have fled for other countries in the region and have sought asylum in European countries and the United States since the republic’s fall.In March 2022, local-language television content produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was taken off the air. Output from China Global Television Network, Deutsche Welle, and Voice of America (VOA) was also banned that month.According to a December 2021 report released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Afghan Independent Journalists Association, 231 of the 543 outlets that operated immediately before the Taliban’s takeover closed by the end of that year. Some 6,430 media workers, meanwhile, were no longer working in the field. Women were especially affected, with 84 percent of female workers losing their jobs. Since September 2021, the IEA has introduced at least three sets of guidelines for the media, though the guidelines were not publicly shared. Among other things, these guidelines instruct outlets and journalists to show respect for Islam, desist from reporting news items considered false, refrain from publishing information the regime has not confirmed, and operate within cultural norms. Entertainment programming that is believed to violate social and cultural norms is banned. Women’s dress is also restricted under the guidelines. At least three Taliban organs have actively enforced these restrictions: the Ministry of Information and Culture, the Ministry of Vice and Virtue (MVV), and the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI).In practice, authorities have exercised arbitrary control over the media, well beyond what is implied by their published guidelines. Journalists have been subject to arbitrary arrest, detention, threats, and harassment, primarily from the GDI. Pressure has mainly been directed towards ensuring favorable coverage of the regime, stifling criticism, and reducing coverage of opponents and critics. Self-censorship is pervasive as a result.Established outlets now operate from abroad, while new outlets focused on Afghanistan have been formed outside the country since the IEA was established; all these outlets rely on social media to share their output. The Taliban have increased their own social-media activity and have warned people against accessing critical posts. Nevertheless, social media remains uncensored and accessible to Afghans.",1,"Religious freedom, which was already hampered by violence and discrimination under the republic, has been heavily curtailed by the Taliban, who vigorously assert their interpretation of the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam.During 2022, the MVV expanded its moral code covering dress, behavior, and religious observance. In January, the MVV placed posters in Kabul that called on women to dress according to the regime’s interpretation of Sharia. In May, the MVV ordered women to wear clothing that only exposed their eyes in public and urged them to remain at home. The MVV also intensified enforcement operations, though provincial-level directorates reportedly exercised a degree of discretion in applying the new code.Government organs, particularly the GDI, have systematically persecuted religious minorities. Adherents of Salafism have been especially targeted, with members facing arbitrary detention, forced disappearance, torture, and summary execution by the Taliban, who accuse them of supporting the ISKP. Christians, who are few in number, also face arrest and violence. The regime does not persecute members of the Hazara community, most of whom identify as Shiite, as a matter of policy. However, Hazaras face persecution in practice, with individual members being targeted and houses of worship being desecrated during military operations in Hazara-majority areas. Hazara and Shiite populations were also targeted by the ISKP in 2022. The ISKP launched several attacks during the Ashura holiday in August, killing and injuring over 120 people according to UNAMA. In late September, at least 53 people were killed when a suicide bomber detonated a device in a Hazara-majority section of Kabul.",1,"The regime sought to transform Afghanistan’s educational system during 2022; it initiated an ideologically driven review of the curriculum, patronized its supporters when recruiting teachers, and banned books and other materials. The regime has also favored religious schools over other institutions; several dozen schools, universities, and training centers have been converted into religious institutions since the IEA was established.",0,"Afghans cannot freely engage in private discussion without risking offline and online surveillance. Criticism of the IEA or its moral code is grounds for arrest, as are sympathetic statements towards the National Resistance Front (NRF), an armed group that has resisted Taliban rule in the north. The GDI has worked to expand its network of agents, who are paid to inform on their neighbors’ activities. Taliban routinely search mobile phones for social media comments criticizing the regime.",0
albania,"While the constitution guarantees freedom of expression, the intermingling of powerful business, political, and media interests inhibits the development of independent news outlets; most are seen as biased toward either the PS or the PD. Reporters have little job security, low salaries, and remain subject to lawsuits, intimidation, and occasional physical attack by those facing media scrutiny.In November 2022, Council of Europe (CoE) fact finders warned that the Albanian media environment was worsening due in part to media-sector concentration. The CoE mission also voiced concerns over the independence of the country’s media regulator, the Audiovisual Media Authority. The government restricted reporting on sensitive subjects in 2022. In June, prosecutors ordered outlets not to report on state witnesses’ testimony from an organized-crime investigation. In September, prosecutors banned the publication of material that was revealed via a cyberattack.",2,"The constitution provides for freedom of religion, which is generally upheld in practice.",4,"The government typically does not limit academic freedom, though teachers in several districts have faced pressure ahead of elections to participate in political rallies. Access to higher education is affected by corruption.",3,There are no significant restrictions on private discussion.,4
algeria,"Although some newspapers are privately owned and some journalists remain aggressive in their coverage of government affairs, most papers rely on government agencies for printing and advertising, encouraging self-censorship. Authorities sometimes block distribution of independent news outlets that are based abroad or online. Viewers can access unlicensed private television channels that are located in Algeria but legally based abroad, though these are subject to government crackdowns.A 2020 law criminalized “fake news” that undermines public order and security; offenders can receive one- to five-year prison sentences. News sites must be directed by Algerian nationals and based physically in Algeria, report income sources, and keep an archive of at least six months. Foreign-language websites must be approved by a special authority. In September 2022, the government unveiled a bill that, if approved, would prevent newspapers from receiving any funding from abroad or from “suspicious sources.” Authorities use these and other legal mechanisms to restrict media activity. A number of media outlets were shuttered in 2022, including the independent French-language newspaper Liberté, which reportedly closed due to political pressure. In December, authorities closed Radio M—one of the last remaining critical media outlets in Algeria—after security forces raided its offices and arrested Ihsane el-Kadi, its editor in chief. El-Kadi, who has been arrested in connection with his work several times in recent years, was charged with threatening national security and “receiving suspicious funding from foreign sources.”Journalists and bloggers are frequently subjected to harassment, including brief detentions and fines for offenses such as defamation and “undermining national unity.” Journalists covering demonstrations or who are close to the Hirak have been arbitrarily arrested and interrogated; several of these incidents were reported in 2022. In one case in January, journalist Merzoug Touati was sentenced to a year in prison for “spreading false information” after writing an article condemning the conditions in which a detained activist was being held. Foreign outlets are also subject to government interference. In 2021, the government withdrew France 24’s authorization to operate in Algeria, alleging that the French state-owned broadcaster engaged in “repeated hostility” toward national institutions.",1,"Algeria’s population is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. Members of religious minorities, including Christians and non-Sunni Muslims, suffer from state persecution and interference. Authorities have cracked down on the small Ahmadi community, claiming that its members denigrate Islam, threaten national security, and violate laws on associations. In June 2022, 18 Ahmadis were charged in Béjaïa with participating in “an unauthorized group” and “denigrating Islam.” In a September trial, three were sentenced to a year in prison, and the remaining 15 were fined and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Religious communities may only gather to worship at state-approved locations. Accusations of nonbelief or blasphemy can draw criminal punishments. Proselytizing by non-Muslims is illegal. In September 2022, authorities requested that that the Algerian branch of Caritas, a charitable organization affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, cease operating in the country. The government did not provide an explanation, but local sources reported that the request was likely made because the government considered Caritas to be a foreign organization. Authorities have engaged in a crackdown on the Algerian Protestant Church (EPA) since 2017, though the EPA had been legally recognized in 1974. In April 2022, a Protestant church in Tizi Ouzou Province was closed following an order from the governor, becoming the 17th Protestant church to be closed since 2017.",1,"Authorities generally do not interfere directly with the operations of universities, but debate is circumscribed in practice due to restrictive laws that limit speech more broadly. Academic work is also affected by state censorship of domestically published and imported books. Student organizations were active in the Hirak, with members calling for political reforms. The authorities occasionally resorted to violence to suppress these demonstrations.",2,"Private discussion and the public expression of personal views are relatively unhindered when they do not focus on certain sensitive topics, but social media users are subject to prosecution for critical comments that touch on the government or religion. The government monitors internet activity in the name of national security and does not disclose information about the program’s targets or range, which is thought to be extensive.The authorities are known to prosecute social media users, particularly Hirak supporters. A Hirak activist, Hakim Debbazi, was arrested in February 2022, allegedly for posting pro-Hirak information on Facebook. Debbazi died in pretrial detention in April, after a court rejected a request that he be released due to his deteriorating health.",2
andorra,"There are several daily and weekly newspapers, and the country’s only domestic television station is operated by the public broadcaster Ràdio i Televisió d’Andorra. Residents have access to a variety of foreign media services. While press freedom is generally respected, criminal defamation laws remain on the books, and business, political, and religious interests have historically influenced media coverage; reporting on the activities of Andorra’s banks has been particularly difficult. The biggest media outlets are dependent on state advertising, which limits their opportunities to criticize the government.",3,"Freedom of religion is generally upheld, but the Roman Catholic Church enjoys a privileged position that allows it to draw on some state support and bypass some bureaucratic processes that other faith groups must adhere to. In April 2022, the parliament amended the Education Law to ban conspicuous religious symbols—such as yarmulkes, hijabs, and large crosses—in public schools, which Amnesty International has called discriminatory. In October, the government approved a decree providing students who are affected by the new law with the option to take classes online. In one case, a Muslim girl began taking her classes online so that she would not be made to remove her headscarf in the classroom.Despite years of negotiations between the Muslim community and the government, there is no recognized mosque for the country’s roughly 2,000 Muslims. The government has organized meetings with Jewish and Muslim communities to discuss the possible establishment of a special cemetery where those groups could conduct burials according to their customs and beliefs, but little progress has been made.",3,"There are no restrictions on academic freedom, and the educational system is free from indoctrination.",4,"There are no significant constraints on personal expression or freedom of private discussion. Authorities are not known to illegally monitor private online communications. However, in 2020, authorities drew up three slander charges against activist Vanessa Mendoza Cortés, who advocated for safe abortions, which Amnesty International and other international human rights groups called an attack on freedom of expression. Two of the charges were dropped in June 2021, but Mendoza Cortés, whose trial had not yet occurred by the end of 2022, could still face a fine of 30,000 euros (approximately $32,775).",4
angola,"The Angolan state owns most media in the country, and such outlets report favorably on the government, rarely carrying critical coverage. Most ostensibly private outlets also act as mouthpieces of the regime. However, content produced by foreign news agencies is widely consumed.Insult and defamation are considered criminal offenses. Journalists accused of engaging in incitement, hate speech, defense of fascist or racist ideologies, or dissemination of “fake news” can be charged with “abuse of press freedom.” Government officials regularly file criminal complaints as well as civil lawsuits against members of the press in practice. Journalists also face physical violence in the course of their work, with several assaults reported during 2022.",1,"The constitution guarantees religious freedom, but the government imposes onerous criteria on religious groups for official recognition, which is required for the legal construction of houses of worship. Many Pentecostal churches remain unregistered.There are no registered Muslim groups, though Muslim communities have been vocal in their demands for recognition and the right to worship freely.",2,"Academics must maintain a façade of agreement with the MPLA’s preferred narratives and refrain from open criticism of the party, or risk losing their positions. Those who voice dissent are often monitored by security services.",2,"Fear of retribution for expressing criticism of the government or controversial opinions in private conversations persists in Angola, and self-censorship is common. Known surveillance of civil society groups, journalists, and academics can leave ordinary citizens reluctant to speak out. The government actively monitors online activity.Opposition parties’ youth organizations claim that repression of political dissent has increased in recent years, citing several instances of arbitrary arrests and intimidation of government critics by state security forces.",2
antigua-and-barbuda,"Press freedom is generally respected in Antigua and Barbuda. Criminal defamation was abolished in 2015. However, under the Sedition and Undesirable Publications Act, seditious libel is a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of two years in prison and a maximum fine of $5,000. Journalists remain at risk of libel suits from politicians subject to media scrutiny. The prime minister has characterized the often-critical Observer as “fake news” and a threat to the country.Most media outlets are concentrated among a small number of firms affiliated with either the ABLP or UPP.",3,"The constitution provides for freedom of worship as well as the right to practice and change religion, and these freedoms are generally respected. A law outlawing blasphemous language is not enforced.",4,Academic freedom is generally respected.,4,Individuals are generally free to express their personal views on political or other sensitive topics.,4
argentina,"Argentina has a robust and lively media environment. The law guarantees freedom of expression and bans official censorship. However, media ownership is concentrated among large conglomerates that frequently favor a political grouping, and state advertising allocation tends to favor government-friendly media groups. Journalists face occasional harassment and violence, especially when covering corruption and drug-related criminality. Some journalists have faced charges in connection with their investigative work.",3,"Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and enforced in practice. The population is largely Roman Catholic but public education is secular, and religious minorities express their faiths freely.",4,Academic freedom is guaranteed by law and largely observed in practice.,4,"Private discussion is vibrant and largely unrestricted. However, government agencies have been known to monitor social media activity, and intelligence services have been accused of illegally surveilling journalists, politicians, and civil society groups. In November 2022, a federal prosecutor requested that former president Macri be indicted on espionage charges for allegedly using Argentina’s intelligence services to illegally monitor opposition leaders.",4
armenia,"Independent and investigative outlets operate relatively freely in Armenia, and generally publish online. Small independent outlets often provide robust coverage challenging the narratives of state broadcasters and other establishment media. By comparison, most print and broadcast outlets are affiliated with political or larger commercial interests.In 2021, authorities imposed several new restrictions on media freedom, including limiting the free movement of journalists in the parliament and in parts of the Syunik region. In July of that year, the parliament criminalized the act of directing serious insults (defamation) toward officials and public figures. After significant outcry from journalists’ associations and human rights organizations raising concerns that the law could be easily abused, the law was removed from the criminal code in July 2022.The Committee to Protect Freedom of Expression (CPFE), a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), recorded that 15 journalists had experienced physical violence between January and September 2022.",2,"Article 18 of the constitution recognizes the Armenian Apostolic Church as a “national church” responsible for the preservation of Armenian national identity; 94 percent of the population identifies as Armenian Apostolic. Religious minorities have reported some discrimination in the past.In 2020, the National Security Service (NSS) opened an investigation into Yazidi activist Sashik Sultanyan after he publicly stated that Yazidis experience discrimination in Armenia; international human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have criticized the investigation as retaliatory and unlawful. The trial was in progress at the end of 2022.",2,"Although the constitution protects academic freedom, administrative and accreditation processes remain open to political influence. There is some self-censorship among academics on politically sensitive subjects. In March 2021, the parliament issued an executive order allowing the government to appoint most members of the boards of trustees for three of the country’s leading state universities, which enables the authorities to exercise more control over the universities’ key decisions, including the election of university rectors.In August 2022, Yerevan State University student Taron Manukyan, son of opposition member of Parliament Gegham Manukyan who had been arrested for assault, was expelled from the university for failing to take in-person exams. Gegham Manukyan claimed authorities had stepped in to prevent his son from sitting for his online or at the place he is detained, as other people in prison had been able to do so.",2,"Private discussion is relatively free and vibrant. The law prohibits wiretapping or other electronic surveillance without judicial approval, though the judiciary lacks independence and has been accused of excessive deference to law enforcement agencies requesting consent. In July 2022, the minister of justice removed provisions from the criminal code that criminalized defamation, which had been implemented in July 2021 and had been used to open at least nine criminal cases against people accused of insulting public figures.In late 2021, reports by Meta and Citizen Lab claimed that Armenian authorities had paid for the use of Predator spyware, created by the North Macedonian company Cytrox. The spyware had been used to target journalists, dissidents, and human rights activists in several countries, including Armenia. In May 2022, a report by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also linked the use of Cytrox spyware to victims in Armenia, claiming “government-backed actors” were responsible. Local media outlets reported that the devices of several political dissidents had been hacked.",3
australia,"Though the constitution does not explicitly protect press freedom, journalists scrutinize lawmakers and the government, covering controversial topics generally without serious obstacles or risk of harassment or violence. Members of the press have been constricted by the use of judicial suppression orders while covering criminal cases.In February 2021, the government passed the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code, which established a mandatory arbitration regime for digital platforms, such as Facebook and Google, to negotiate with and ultimately pay news outlets for using their content. The code has been criticized for potentially weakening media diversity, but  by August 2022, it had resulted in an additional AU$200 million ($138 million) in revenue for Australian news outlets arising from deals they struck with global platforms. The increase in revenue has been used to fund new hiring at some outlets. Public figures, including politicians, regularly sue journalists or members of the public for defamation for publishing unfavorable stories or other content about them, particularly online. In a recent example, the Federal Court of Australia ordered in June 2022 that Google pay former deputy premier of New South Wales John Barilaro AU$715,000 ($493,000) in damages after popular blogger Jordan Shanks-Markovina posted videos on YouTube found to be defamatory toward Barilaro.",3,"The constitution explicitly prohibits laws that would either impose or restrict religious expression, and individuals are generally able to express religious beliefs or nonbelief.",4,"Academic freedom is generally respected. However, federal officials have in the past warned of Chinese attempts to monitor Chinese students in Australia, and to question academics in Australia whose views differed from those of the Chinese government. Some students have expressed fears of foreign surveillance, prompting them to wear masks to protect their identities while protesting Chinese government actions. Some universities receive significant amounts of foreign funding, particularly from China, which has further raised concerns over Beijing’s influence on curriculums and university governance.",4,"Generally, people in Australia may freely discuss personal views on sensitive topics, though the government has passed several laws in recent years increasing its surveillance powers. A data retention law requires telecommunications companies to store users’ metadata for two years and has raised concerns about the government’s ability to track mobile and online communications. In 2019, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) disclosed that it accessed Australians’ metadata nearly 20,000 times and reviewed the metadata of journalists 58 times during its 2017–18 reporting period. In late 2021, the Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Act 2021 was enacted, granting the AFP and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission broad surveillance powers, including powers to take over user accounts and disrupt user activity. Rights groups have criticized the laws as overly broad with insufficient safeguards.The 2018 Assistance and Access Act requires technology companies to provide law enforcement agencies access to encrypted communications, on grounds that include preventing terrorism and crime. Civil rights groups criticized the law’s broad reach, relative lack of oversight, and steep fines for companies that do not comply. Vault Systems, an Australian provider of cloud services, warned in 2019 that multinational companies were increasingly housing their data in other countries because of the legislation.",4
austria,"The federal constitution and the Media Law of 1981 provide the basis for free media in Austria. However, libel and slander laws protect politicians and government officials, many of whom—particularly members of the FPÖ—have filed defamation suits in recent years. Media ownership remains highly concentrated, particularly in the provinces, and the government exerts some influence on the state broadcaster, the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF).Media outlets are eligible to receive government funding through advertising and in the form of press subsidies intended to ensure media diversity. In March 2022, a broad parliamentary majority approved amendments to a 2004 media financing law, including reforms making €20 million in government funding available annually. In 2021, several ÖVP politicians resigned over allegations of having purchased favorable news coverage during the 2017 elections. Former family minister Sophie Karmasin was arrested on corruption charges related to the scandal in March 2022.While there is no official censorship, Austrian law prohibits any form of neo-Nazism or antisemitism, as well as the public denial, approval, or justification of Nazi crimes, including the Holocaust.",3,"Religious freedom is constitutionally guaranteed. Austrian law divides religious organizations into three legal categories: officially recognized religious societies, religious confessional communities, and associations. Many religious minority groups allege that the law impedes their legitimate claims for recognition and demotes them to second-class status.Foreign funding for Muslim houses of worship and imams is prohibited by a 2015 law; Orthodox Christian and Jewish groups with similarly strong links to communities abroad face no such restrictions. The FPÖ has been criticized for stoking anti-Muslim sentiment through controversial advertising campaigns. In recent years, antisemitic and anti-Islamic tendencies have become more prevalent. Nearly 1,000 antisemitic attacks were recorded during 2021—a more than 65 percent increase over those recorded in 2020. According to the Jewish Community of Vienna (IKG), the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the first half of 2022 marked a 32 percent decrease compared to the same period in 2021. In 2021, the ÖVP–Green government established a new staff unit in the fight against antisemitism. In May 2022, representatives from 15 European Union (EU) member states met in Vienna to discuss standardizing the recording of antisemitic incidents and crimes.",3,"Academic freedom is generally upheld, and the educational system is free from extensive political indoctrination.",4,"Private discussion in Austria is generally free and unrestricted. However, there have been some difficulties related to the balance between ensuring freedom of speech and enforcing legal prohibitions on hate speech.",4
azerbaijan,"Constitutional guarantees for press freedom are routinely and systematically violated, as the government works to maintain a tight grip on the information landscape. Defamation remains a criminal offense. Legal amendments passed in 2017 extended government control over online media, allowing blocking of websites without a court order if they are deemed to contain content that poses a danger to the state or society. Independent news sites are regularly blocked or struck with cyberattacks.Journalists face detention or imprisonment on false charges, along with travel bans. In late 2020, Polad Aslanov, editor in chief of news sites Xeberman and Press-az, received a 16-year prison sentence for selling state secrets to Iran. Aslanov claimed that he was targeted for reporting on corruption.Journalists also risk surveillance. In 2021, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reported that Azerbaijani journalists were among those targeted with the Pegasus spyware tool, which was likely supplied to the Azerbaijani government.In 2021, Aliyev issued a presidential decree that called for “media reforms” and created a new media body, the Media Development Agency (MEDIA). That December, the parliament passed a bill authored with MEDIA’s involvement that, among other things, requires journalists to register with the authorities and media owners to reside in Azerbaijan. Local and international media rights groups criticized the legislation, which was approved by Aliyev in February 2022. Journalists—and their relatives—face harassment, violence, and intimidation, including by authorities. In February 2022, journalist Fatima Movlamli reported being beaten by police after refusing to delete a recording she made while covering a protest. Journalist Ayten Mammadova was attacked by an unknown man because of her work in May. The assailant threatened Mammadova and her young child with a knife, and demanded that Mammadova cease her coverage of an unnamed trial.",0,"The regime exercises control over religion through state-affiliated entities such as the Caucasus Muslim Board. Religious communities that attempt to operate independently face burdensome registration requirements, interference with the importation and distribution of printed religious materials, and arrest and harassment of religious leaders with international ties or a significant following. For example, members of the Muslim Unity Movement, a nonviolent conservative Shiite group, have been subjected to mass arrests, torture, and imprisonment as part of a crackdown that began in 2015.  A number of mosques have been closed in recent years, ostensibly for registration or safety violations. Jehovah’s Witnesses face harassment as well as prosecution for evading military service.",0,"The authorities have long curtailed academic freedom. Some educators have reported being dismissed for links to opposition groups, and students have faced expulsion and other punishments for similar reasons. The Azerbaijani history curriculum is known to include negative and discriminatory references to Armenians.",1,"Law enforcement bodies monitor private telephone and online communications—particularly of activists, political figures, and foreign nationals—without judicial oversight. The escalation of government persecution of critics and their families has undermined the assumption of privacy among ordinary residents and eroded the openness of private discussion. Even state officials have been punished for their and their family members’ social media activity, and activists have been imprisoned—on unrelated, fabricated charges—for critical Facebook posts. In recent years, activists have been targeted by spear-phishing campaigns designed to install malicious software on their computers or steal personal information. Activists report that harassment on social media, often highly sexualized for women activists, is commonplace. Social media users and antiwar activists who signed a statement calling for a peaceful resolution to the 2020 conflict over control of Nagorno-Karabakh were harassed and threatened online, prompting at least one activist to remove their signature.In 2021, the OCCRP reported that people who had casual or familial connections to activists and journalists were targeted with Pegasus.",1

However, ordinary Bahamians can face libel charges.",4
bahrain,"The government owns all national broadcast media outlets, and the private owners of Bahrain’s main newspapers have close ties to the state. Self-censorship is encouraged by the vaguely worded Press Law, which allows the state to imprison journalists for criticizing the king or Islam or for threatening national security. Insulting the king is punishable by up to seven years’ imprisonment. A 2016 edict requires newspapers to apply for a one-year renewable license to publish online. The government blocked access to Qatari news outlets between 2017, when diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed, and January 2021, when these ties were restored. Nonetheless, Al Jazeera remains inaccessible.

Journalists face legal and bureaucratic obstacles to their work in practice. The authorities have refused to renew the credentials of several Bahraini journalists working with foreign outlets. Five journalists remained imprisoned in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). International journalists face difficulty obtaining an entry visa.",0,"Islam is the state religion, and the penal code criminalizes blasphemy-related offenses. However, non-Muslim minority groups are generally free to practice their faiths. Both Muslim and non-Muslim religious groups are required to register with government ministries. In November 2022, Pope Francis became the first Roman Catholic pontiff to travel to Bahrain, the home of the Persian Gulf’s first and largest Catholic churches, with the aim of advancing interreligious dialogue. Muslim religious groups are required to register with the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs through the Sunni or Shiite awqaf (endowments) that oversee mosques and prayer houses; their directors are appointed by royal decree and paid by the government.

Although Shiite communities are free to carry out religious observances like Ashura, Shiite clerics and community leaders face harassment, interrogation, prosecution, and imprisonment. Shiite religious sites were demolished or vandalized in 2011 in apparent reprisal for the role of Shiite opposition groups in that year’s protests. The Islamic Ulema Council, a group of Shiite clerics, was banned in 2014. Shiite cleric Isa Qassim lost his citizenship in 2016, received a suspended sentence for money laundering in 2017, and left Bahrain in 2018. Other Shiite clergy have been detained or questioned for their actual or suspected involvement in protest activity.",1,"Academic freedom is not formally restricted, but scholars who criticize the government have in the past been subject to dismissal, and universities are affected by a broader climate in which criticism is frequently equated with disloyalty.",0,"The penal code includes a variety of punishments for offenses such as insulting the king or state institutions and spreading false news. Many Bahrainis have been convicted and jailed for political speech, including on social media. Authorities have also warned against online expression that contradicts the foreign policy priorities of Bahrain and its regional allies. Following social media accounts deemed to promote sedition can constitute a cybercrime.

Security services are believed to employ networks of informers, and the government monitors the personal communications of activists, critics, and opposition members. Researchers with Toronto-based Citizen Lab have detected Pegasus spyware on the devices of at least a dozen Bahraini activists since 2020.",1
bangladesh,"Journalists and media outlets face many forms of pressure, including frequent lawsuits, harassment, and serious or deadly physical attacks. Throughout 2022, journalists were arrested or physically assaulted for critical reporting on the government, which has escalated under the AL government. A climate of impunity for attacks on media workers remains the norm, and there has been little progress made to ensure justice for a series of blogger murders since 2015. Dozens of bloggers remain in hiding or exile.The 2018 Digital Security Act (DSA) allows the government to conduct searches or arrest individuals without a warrant, criminalizes various forms of online speech, and was vehemently opposed by journalists. Forms of artistic expression contained in books, films, and other materials are occasionally banned or censored.",1,"Islam is designated as the official religion, though the constitution designates secularism as a fundamental principle. Although religious minorities have the right to worship freely, they occasionally face legal repercussions for proselytizing or alleged blasphemy. Members of minority groups—including Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and Shiite and Ahmadiyya Muslims—face harassment and violence, including occasional mob violence against their houses of worship. Violence against religious minorities can be deliberately provoked on social media. In July 2022, for example, Hindu-owned homes and businesses were vandalized along with a temple in the village of Sahapara in apparent response to a Facebook post that denigrated Islam. Those with secular or nonconformist views can face societal opprobrium and attacks from hardline Islamist groups.",2,"In recent years, Bangladesh’s academic institutions have faced frequent threats from a variety of actors, resulting in reduced autonomy and rising self-censorship. Faculty hiring and promotion are often linked to support for the AL, and campus debate is often stifled by the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the party’s student wing; the BCL acts with impunity despite being known to law enforcement. In 2022, the BCL continued to suppress dissent and attack government critics on campus.Islamist groups have growing influence on government policy and standards, compelling changes to educational content they deemed “atheistic” in widely used Bengali-language textbooks. Separately, Islamic extremists have attacked secular professors.",1,"Open discussion of sensitive religious and political issues is restrained by fears of harassment and violence from the government and religious fundamentalists. Religious fundamentalists have retaliated against those who publicly discuss LGBT+ rights, atheism, or criticism of Islamist movements. Bangladeshis are fearful of expressing dissent. A 2019 poll from the International Republican Institute indicated that a considerable number of Bangladeshis are afraid to publicly express their political opinions and widely reported self-censorship. The DSA has enabled the government to increase censorship of digital content and surveillance of telecommunications and social media; nearly 1,000 individuals were arrested under the DSA for mostly politicized and minor offenses between late 2018 and mid-2021 according to Amnesty International.The government published the draft Data Protection Act, 2022, in July; Amnesty International had criticized its proposed framework in April, warning that it would give authorities access to encrypted communications and effectively override the RIA.",2

belarus,"The government exercises unrestricted control over mainstream media. The 2008 media law secures a state monopoly over information about political, social, and economic affairs. Libel is both a civil and criminal offense, and the criminal code contains provisions protecting the “honor and dignity” of high-ranking officials.The government owns the only internet service provider and controls the internet through legal and technical means. From August 9 to 12, 2020, during the height of the mass prodemocracy protests, the government disrupted internet access in almost the entire country, limiting reporters’ ability to provide accurate information to the public. Internet disruptions were registered during protest rallies throughout 2020.The official definition of mass media includes websites and blogs, placing them under the Information Ministry’s supervision. Most independent journalists operate under the assumption that the Committee for State Security (KGB) surveils them. Reporters are subject to fines, detention, intimidation, and criminal prosecution for their work. The regime has used antiextremism legislation and investigations into alleged financial crimes to curtail media activity. In 2021, the government amended legislation on “mass media,” “mass events,” and “criminal liability,” all of which tightened restrictions for independent media and significantly increased the already disproportionate criminal penalties for legitimate journalistic activities.The government has forcefully cracked down on independent media in recent years. In 2021 and 2022, security forces raided the offices and homes of independent journalists, arrested journalists and staff members of news outlets, and seized equipment. At least 40 journalists were detained in 2022. Several journalists were given lengthy prison sentences in 2022, including Ksenia Lutskina, who was detained in 2020 following the prodemocracy protests and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment on charges of “conspiring to seize state power” in September 2022. Authorities blocked access to over 100 news and media sites, including the country’s most popular internet portal, Tut.by, in 2021. In March 2022, the government blocked access to several Ukrainian media sites, labeling them “extremist.”",0,"Despite constitutional guarantees of religious equality, government decrees and registration requirements restrict religious activity. Legal amendments in 2002 provided for government censorship of religious publications and barred foreigners from leading religious groups. The amendments also placed strict limitations on religious groups active in Belarus for less than 20 years. In 2003, the government signed a concordat with the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is controlled by the Russian Orthodox Church, giving it a privileged position.After the 2020 elections, Lukashenka attempted to weaken the influence of the Catholic Church, which had denounced state violence against peaceful prodemocracy protesters. Several Catholic priests faced administrative detentions and fines, and some were forced to leave the country. Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, a Belarusian citizen and archbishop of Minsk-Mahileu, was denied reentry to the country in August 2020. Though he was allowed to return to Belarus that December, he resigned in January 2021. Political pressure on the Catholic Church continued throughout 2022. In August, the government closed a Catholic school in Minsk and in October, terminated a decades-long agreement that had allowed the Catholic Church to occupy and use the Church of Saints Simon and Helena in Minsk.",1,"Academic freedom remains subject to intense state ideological pressures, and academic personnel face harassment and dismissal if they use a liberal curriculum or are suspected of disloyalty. Students and professors who join opposition protests or express political dissent face threat of dismissal and revocation of degrees. In recent years, the government has increasingly restricted Belarusian-language instruction in schools and universities. The government pressures young people to join the state-sponsored, pro-Lukashenka Belarusian Republican Union of Youth (BRSM). The government has tightened control over private schools and kindergartens, which has resulted in the closure of many alternative educational centers.Many students were involved in the August 2020 prodemocracy protests. Authorities responded with unprovoked brutality and repression, as plainclothes security forces attacked peaceful student protests within and outside of university campuses. Lukashenka replaced at least eight deans at different universities. Between August 2020 and May 2021, at least 153 university students were arbitrarily expelled, many of whom fled to neighboring countries. Throughout 2021 and 2022, student activists were arrested and given yearslong prison sentences on a variety of spurious charges, including allegedly “violating social order.” In January 2022, President Lukashenka ordered historians to devise a single, unified “correct interpretation of history” to be taught in Belarus, and enacted legislation criminalizing any deviation from the approved historical narrative. Constitutional amendments adopted in February state that the government must “ensure the preservation of historical truth” of Belarusian heroism during World War II, further reinforcing Lukashenka’s narrative. The new official history was introduced in Belarusian schools in September.",0,"The use of wiretapping and other surveillance by state security agencies limits the right to free private discussion. Private citizens often avoid discussing sensitive issues over the phone or via the internet, for fear that state security agents are monitoring conversations.Authorities routinely threaten, harass, and arrest people who speak out against Lukashenka, postelection violence, and the war in Ukraine.Police often coerce, threaten, and torture detained individuals, forcing them to open their mobile devices in search of evidence of antigovernment sentiment. Security forces also organize raids of private homes, detain people in workplaces, and conduct random searches and interrogations to silence dissent. Authorities actively monitor internet users’ social media activity to find evidence of protest involvement. The private company Synesis, which was sanctioned by the European Union (EU), reportedly helped authorities identify and arrest demonstrators after the 2020 elections by providing video surveillance technology with facial recognition.Voicing criticism of public officials and security forces on social media platforms, including sharing posts from other users or media sites that have been labeled “extremist,” can lead to criminal charges. Security forces have violently detained and arrested people who had posted allegedly critical or insulting comments about state officials on social media. Defamation charges were used to prosecute such speech, with ordinary internet users being sentenced to more than a year in prison. Local authorities routinely surveil and monitor individuals who publicly or privately display opposition symbols, including coded phrases or colors, and, since February 2022, antiwar signs or Ukrainian symbols and songs. People who participate in public antiwar appeals face criminal prosecution for “extremism” and “harming national security interests.”Security forces use various strategies to persecute political activists abroad. In 2021, for example, Belarusian authorities forced an Athens–Vilnius Ryanair flight to land in Minsk in order to arrest exiled blogger and opposition activist Raman Pratasevich. Authorities have also canceled the travel documents of dissidents abroad and harassed activists’ relatives who remain in Belarus, including the families of Belarusian military volunteers in Ukraine.",0

The rise of nationalist and far-right parties in Flanders has contributed to the normalization of anti-Muslim rhetoric.Several high-profile anti-Muslim incidents have occurred in recent years. In one case in 2021, a court ordered a Brussels-based public transport company to pay €51,000 ($60,700) in damages to a woman who was denied a job because she wears a hijab.

In 2020, the HAAC banned all “unauthorized” online news outlets, suspending three outlets temporarily; others ignored the order.A 2017 digital media law allows for the prosecution and imprisonment of journalists for online content that is allegedly false or harasses individuals. In February 2022, Beninese journalist Flore Nobime and Dutch journalist Olivier van Beemen were arrested and held for four days on specious charges of espionage after failing to notify authorities that they would be working near Pendjari National Park. The charges were ultimately dropped, but authorities ordered that van Beemen be deported. In December, a journalist was arrested after publishing a story on alleged extrajudicial executions by the police; he was detained for two days and charged with spreading false news to disturb the peace.

china,"China is home to one of the world’s most restrictive media environments and its most sophisticated system of censorship, particularly online. The CCP maintains control over news reporting via direct ownership, accreditation of journalists, harsh penalties for comments that are critical of party leaders or the CCP, and daily directives to media outlets and websites that guide coverage of breaking news stories. State management of the telecommunications infrastructure enables the blocking of websites, removal of smartphone applications from the domestic market, and mass deletion of social media posts and user accounts that address banned political, social, economic, and religious topics. Thousands of websites have been blocked, many for years, including major news and social media hubs like the New York Times, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.

Rules and regulations governing the media and internet usage include measures that restrict news dissemination and contribute to the banning of mobile apps focused on minority languages, Bible content, and foreign-language learning, among other topics. Censors have also removed large numbers of social media groups, accounts, or posts that dealt with LGBT+ issues, financial advice, critical views of CCP history, and celebrities. The country’s network of some 20 million pro-CCP volunteer internet commentators and more than 2 million paid employees continued to aggressively monitor and censor online communications.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 43 journalists were imprisoned in China in 2022, though the number of people held for uncovering or sharing newsworthy information is far greater. Numerous citizen journalists and bloggers were detained, disappeared, or criminally charged during 2022 for their reporting and online posts. Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist and former human rights lawyer, continued to serve a 4-year prison sentence for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” for her reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic. The whereabouts of many others detained for reporting on the pandemic remain unknown.",0,"The CCP regime operates a multifaceted apparatus to control all aspects of religious activity, including by vetting religious leaders for political reliability, placing limits on the number of religious authorities such as priests and imams, requiring ideological conformity within religious doctrine, and installing security cameras inside religious establishments. All religious groups must go through a rigorous process of certification to be officially recognized by the authorities, with those that refuse to do so being labeled illegal and persecuted. Certain religions and religious groups, including Tibetan Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims, Falun Gong practitioners, and Christian “house churches,” are persecuted harshly. In Xinjiang, peaceful religious practices are routinely punished under charges of “religious extremism,” resulting in detention, prison sentences, and indoctrination for many Uyghur, Kazakh, and Hui Muslims.

Thousands of Buddhist, Taoist, and folk-religion temples and house churches across China were completely or partially demolished by authorities in recent years. Authorities were reported to have used COVID-19 restrictions and inspections to justify the closure of churches and other religious venues, even as nearby venues like restaurants remained open.

The government continued to operate mobile “transformation” units, which subject members of “illegal” religious groups to severe psychological and physical torture intended to force them to “transform” by renouncing their religious beliefs. Thousands of members of such illegal groups are also sentenced to long prison terms and illegal forms of detention, in which torture and ill-treatment are routine. Children under the age of 18 are prohibited by law from attending church or engaging in religious activities. Dozens of Falun Gong practitioners were reported to have died in custody, or shortly after their release, in recent years.",0,"Academic freedom is heavily restricted. Efforts to police classroom discussions are present at all levels of education, including via installation of surveillance cameras in some classrooms, large-scale recruitment of student informants, and the creation of special departments to supervise the political thinking of teaching staff. The CCP controls the appointment of top university officials, and CCP committees and party branches have significant formal authority over university administration. Many scholars practice self-censorship to protect their careers and personal safety.

Political indoctrination, including the study of “Xi Jinping Thought,” is a required component of the curriculum at all levels of education. A number of universities have removed references to “freedom of thought” from their charters, replacing them with pledges of loyalty to the CCP. Professors and students face reprisals—ranging from censored writings, travel restrictions, and demotions to arrest and imprisonment—for expressing views that are deemed critical of the CCP’s governance or Xi’s leadership. Authorities have continued to shut down or nationalize private schools across the country, in an effort to bring all education under state control.",0,"Citizens continue to be charged and sentenced to sometimes long prison terms for critical or satirical social media posts on a variety of subjects, notably the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and criticism or perceived criticism of Xi or the CCP. In addition to criminal punishment, internet users face account deletions, job dismissals, arbitrary detention, and police interrogation over such posts.

The government’s vast ability to monitor citizens’ lives and communications inhibits online and offline conversations. Administrators of social media applications like WeChat closely monitor user discussions to ensure conformity with government content restrictions. Surveillance cameras, now frequently augmented with facial-recognition software, cover many urban areas and public transportation, and these networks are expanding into rural regions. Devices used by police to quickly extract and scan data from smartphones, initially deployed in Xinjiang, have spread nationwide.

Police have access to the personal details of broad categories of individuals. China’s Cybersecurity Law obliges companies to store Chinese users’ data within the country and submit to often intrusive security reviews. Telecommunications companies are required to obtain facial scans of new internet or mobile phone users as part of the real-name registration process, which is combined with mass surveillance tools to closely monitor all residents. Electronic surveillance is supplemented with offline monitoring by neighborhood party committees and “public security volunteers” who are visible during large events.

There is an especially heavy police presence in ethnic minority regions, particularly Xinjiang. The ability of Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang to express themselves freely, even in private, has been further undermined in recent years by a policy of having Chinese officials live in their homes to monitor and indoctrinate them.",1

cuba,"Cuba has one of the most restrictive media environments in the world. The formal media sector is owned and controlled by the state, and the constitution prohibits privately owned media. The country’s independent press operates outside the law, its publications are considered “enemy propaganda,” and its journalists are routinely harassed, detained, interrogated, threatened, defamed in the official press, and prohibited from traveling abroad. Government agents regularly accuse them of being mercenaries and even terrorists, and many face charges of “usurpation of legal capacity,” “diffusion of false news,” or other vaguely defined offenses. Journalists at state-owned outlets engage in similar discourse when discussing dissidents; in April 2021, television presenter Humberto López called for members of the dissident San Isidro Movement (MSI) and 27N artist collectives to be charged with “treason against the homeland,” a capital offense.The government closely monitors and persecutes perceived dissidents within the artistic community, mainstream artists, and media figures who air independent or critical views. In May 2021, authorities forcefully entered the home of MSI member Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara —who began a hunger strike over the seizure and destruction of artwork in April—and sent him to a hospital. Otero was discharged at the end of May but was arrested on July 11, as protests were held nationwide.In mid-May 2021, MSI cofounder Maykel Castillo Pérez, who coproduced and performed the antigovernment song “Patria y Vida” (“Homeland and Life”) along with Otero, was detained by the authorities and charged with crimes including “resistance” and “contempt.” Both Castillo and Otero were held in pretrial detention until June 2022, when they were sentenced to nine and five years in prison, respectively.The work of independent media and journalists was further impeded by the passage of the amended penal code in May 2022, which criminalizes the receipt of funds used to promote acts that the government considers contrary to state security. Several rights organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), condemned the legislation as part of an “intricate and perverse legal regime of censorship” by the government intended to further suppress the country’s independent media. Numerous independent journalists were coerced into publicly resigning in exchange for their freedom during the year, and many entered into exile as a result of government repression.",0,"While Cubans do enjoy religious freedom, official obstacles make it difficult for churches to operate without interference.

The amendments also increased potential fines and allow for prison terms between six months and five years for these offenses.",0,"While Article 2 of the 2014 constitution declares Islam to be the official religion, Article 64 states that “freedom of belief is absolute.” Most Egyptians are Sunni Muslims. Coptic Christians form a substantial minority, and there are smaller numbers of Shiite Muslims, non-Coptic Christian denominations, and other groups. Religious minorities and atheists have faced persecution and violence, with Coptic Christians in particular suffering numerous cases of forced displacement, physical assaults, bomb and arson attacks, and blocking of church construction in recent years. Informal reconciliation sessions following instances of sectarian conflict have denied Coptic Christians justice for acts of violence against them. Religious minority groups are often persecuted for expressing their beliefs publicly and are sometimes charged with blasphemy by the authorities.In August 2022, an electrical fire swept through a Coptic Christian church in Giza Governorate, killing at least 41 people, including 18 children. Rights groups claimed that discriminatory government policies and restrictions on the construction and renovation of churches resulted in the conditions that ultimately caused the fire. In January, security forces in al-Minya Governorate arrested nine Coptic Christians protesting authorities’ refusal to rebuild a church in their village, releasing them two months later.",1,"The state controls education and curriculums in public schools and to a lesser degree in some private institutions. Faculty members and departments have some autonomy in shaping specific courses, though many scholars self-censor to avoid punitive measures. University professors can be dismissed for on-campus political activity, and several prominent academics are in prison for expressing political views. The government imposes strict requirements for academics to obtain approval from security officials for travel abroad, and many have been subject to prosecution by emergency courts. Authorities have significant control over the appointment of university presidents and can expel students for political reasons.Since 2013, university students have been subjected to arrest, disciplinary sanctions such as expulsion, military trials, and extrajudicial killings for their political activism.",1,"Individuals who express personal views contrary to preferred state narratives are subject to reprisals. Security agencies extensively surveil and tightly regulate social media companies and users, as well as other mobile phone applications, allowing them to control public discourse.Arrests of activists over social media posts and other activities are common and send a clear message that voicing dissent is intolerable, which contributes to self-censorship among ordinary Egyptians. Dozens of Egyptian activists, rights defenders, and journalists have been targeted by digital phishing attacks as part of an apparent campaign to intimidate and silence critics of the government. Moreover, authorities have targeted content creators on social media platforms, most notably TikTok, charging them with various spurious crimes. Progovernment media figures and state officials regularly call for national unity and suggest that only enemies of the state would criticize authorities.",1
el-salvador,"Despite a vibrant media space and constitutional protections, journalists have reported self-censoring in the face of harassment and violence in response to critical coverage of corruption and public policy. Access to the internet is not restricted, and online outlets are critical sources of independent reporting. However, most Salvadorans rely on social media and privately owned television and radio networks for news, and ownership in the broadcast sector is highly concentrated. Fake news and disinformation campaigns are widespread and fomented by key government officials, including through surrogate online media outlets.A January 2022 report published by multiple human rights and research groups found that at least 35 Salvadoran journalists had been targeted with Pegasus spyware in 2020 and 2021, allegedly by the Salvadoran government, although the researchers could not definitively prove this. In February 2021 and July 2022, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) granted protection measures to dozens of journalists in the country, many of whom had owned devices that were compromised by Pegasus surveillance. In April 2022, the government passed a law threatening journalists who convey messages from gangs with 10 to 15 years in prison, and in August the Association of Journalists of El Salvador reported that nine Salvadoran journalists were living in exile due to government harassment.",2,"Religious freedom is widely respected by state and nonstate actors. For several years, people in some communities have been unable to access their churches due to territorial disputes between gangs. Some religious leaders working with former gang members face harassment by gangs and police and the threat of violence. However, the mass arrests of people suspected of gang affiliation that began in March 2022 improved perceptions of security, and more individuals have attended religious services safely.",4,"Academic freedom is respected, and the educational system is generally free from extensive political indoctrination.",3,"While private discussion and personal expression are generally free, the prevalence of gang activity has led many Salvadorans to curtail speech about criminal activity and other sensitive topics outside of their homes. The government has used illegal surveillance mechanisms as part of its crackdown on gang activity that began in March 2022. In February 2022, reforms to the criminal code permitted “necessary undercover digital operations” to investigate alleged crimes without a court order. In May, the government and legislature massively boosted the Prosecutor General of the Republic’s wiretap budget and in September removed legal restrictions on wiretapping.On multiple occasions, authorities used these legal changes, which were allegedly passed to crack down on gang-related activity, to arrest private individuals who critiqued government figures or policy. In August, Luis Rivas was arrested and charged with contempt of the president for anonymously posting on Twitter stating that members of President Bukele’s family were at the beach with a large number of bodyguards. In early September, Rivas was released on bail for $10,000, but immediately rearrested on new, undisclosed charges. Days earlier, police briefly and arbitrarily arrested citizen Mario Gómez after he criticized the Bukele government’s implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender online. Two weeks later, another six people were arrested for criticizing government officials on social media.",2
equatorial-guinea,"Press freedom is severely limited, despite constitutional protections. Most journalists consistently exercise self-censorship, and those who do criticize the regime are subject to dismissal and other reprisals. The country’s only private television and radio broadcaster, RTV-Asonga, is controlled by Teodorín. The handful of private newspapers and magazines in operation face intense financial and political pressure and are unable to publish regularly. The government has long sought to block access to the websites of opposition parties and exile groups, and online versions of some Spanish newspapers are regularly blocked. The government has obstructed access to the internet in times of political tension.",0,"Religious freedom is protected by the constitution, though in practice it is sometimes affected by the country’s broader political repression and endemic corruption. The Roman Catholic Church is the dominant faith and is exempt from registration and permit requirements that apply to other groups. Government officials are regularly required to attend Catholic masses.In 2020, the government disbanded two religious groups on the grounds that they did not comply with COVID-19-related restrictions. The decree took effect without due process and included deportation orders for foreign pastors associated with the groups.In August 2022, pastor Rubén Mayé Nsue Mangue, a former minister of justice and ambassador to the United States, was arrested and banned from practicing his religion after he allegedly criticized the government in sermons and on social media. He was forcibly disappeared for days after his arrest and remained in detention at year’s end.",1,"Academic freedom is politically constrained, and self-censorship among faculty is common. Some university professors and teachers have reportedly been hired or dismissed due to their political affiliations.",1,"Freedoms of personal expression and private discussion are restricted. The government uses informants and electronic surveillance to monitor dissent, and critics of the government are subject to arbitrary arrest, physical abuse, and trumped-up criminal charges.In September 2022, ahead of the general elections in November, several alleged opponents of the government were arrested based in part on their social media activity and private communications. At least three detainees were accused of plotting a terrorist action and shown confessing on state television.",0
eritrea,"The government shut down all independent media outlets in 2001. Several outlets provide coverage to Eritreans from outside the country, including the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Paris-based Radio Erena, and satellite station Asena TV. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 16 journalists remain imprisoned as of 2022 for their work in Eritrea.",0,"The government places strict limits on the exercise of religion. Eritrea officially recognizes only four faiths: Sunni Islam, Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and Evangelical Lutheranism. Religious practice is prohibited among members of the military.Asmara interferes in the practice of recognized faiths. The patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Church (EOC), Abune Antonios, was deposed in 2006 and expelled from the EOC for “heresy” in 2019. He remained under house arrest until his death in February 2022. In May 2021, Asmara announced the election of Abune Qerlos as patriarch. Qerlos died in December 2022 and had not been replaced before the end of the year.Followers of other denominations are subject to arrest, imprisonment, and the loss of property. Jehovah’s Witnesses face severe persecution, including detention and denial of citizenship.Although the government had released several religious prisoners in 2020 and 2021, in October 2022, authorities arrested a Catholic bishop and two priests for unknown reasons; church officials were not informed of bishop and priests’ whereabouts. Church officials have routinely criticized the Eritrean government’s involvement in the conflict in Tigray, as well as the government’s antidemocratic behavior. The bishop and one of the priests were released in December.",1,"Academic freedom is greatly constrained. Students in their last year of secondary school must perform military service at the Sawa military training center. In 2019, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that widespread physical and sexual abuse took place at Sawa.In August 2022, Eritrean authorities took over the Hagaz Agricultural and Technical Boarding School, a Catholic-run institution; another Catholic-run technical school was set to be taken over by the government in September.",0,"Freedoms of expression and private discussion are severely inhibited by fear of government informants and the likelihood of arrest and arbitrary detention for any airing of dissent. The authorities regularly block access to social media platforms and shutter internet cafés.Members of the Eritrean diaspora are, by comparison, better able to express dissent online. However, members of the diaspora are also subject to government surveillance and harassment.",0
estonia,"The government generally respects freedom of the press. However, judges sometimes use the criminal procedure code to restrict media coverage in various cases of public interest, particularly those concerning corruption. Public and private television and radio stations broadcast freely, and there are a number of independent newspapers. In February 2022, Estonia amended its media law, increasing the media regulator’s independence and requiring greater transparency around media ownership structures.

Observers have noted a trend toward ownership concentration, especially at the regional level. Some local media have struggled amid the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing digitalization in the media market.

The Russian military’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered Estonian regulatory institutions to block access to Russian media outlets beginning in February 2022.",4,Religious freedom is respected in law and in practice.,4,"Academic freedom is generally respected. However, by law, public Russian-language high schools must teach 60 percent of their curriculum in the Estonian language, and a new education law adopted in December 2022 requires that the country’s schools transition gradually to Estonian as the only language of instruction. The timeline set out by the law begins with the 2024–25 school year and ends with the 2032–33 school year. However, there are concerns that shortages of teachers and material resources might interfere with the transition timeline. Following the switch, children from Russian-speaking families will be given the opportunity to learn Russian language and culture in separate classes.",4,There are no significant constraints on the freedoms of personal expression and private discussion.,4
eswatini,"A variety of laws, including the Sedition and Subversive Activities Act (SSAA) and defamation laws, can be used to restrict media coverage by criminalizing publications that are alleged to be seditious, as well as the use of words that are alleged to be seditious, for example, those that “may excite disaffection” against the king. Journalists often face harassment, assault, and intimidation, and self-censorship is reportedly common. The state broadcaster is tightly controlled by the government, and the Swazi Observer, a major newspaper, is effectively owned by the king. Journalists have faced questioning, detention, or other forms of scrutiny for their reporting or their own political activity in recent years. Numerous journalists fled the country in 2020 after being detained and physically assaulted by police for their work. In 2021, two South African journalists covering antigovernment protests were arrested and reportedly tortured by Eswatini security forces. In July 2022, the prime minister declared journalist Zweli Martin Dlamini and his online publication Swaziland News to be “terrorist entities”; Dlamini, whose reporting focused on antigovernment protests and prodemocracy movements in Eswatini, called the decision an attempt to suppress the voice of the people. In response to the use of social media to promote the widespread protests that took place throughout the year, the government twice blocked internet access in the country in 2021. That June, the Eswatini Communications Commission (ESCCOM) ordered a countrywide internet shutdown that lasted more than a week. A second internet blackout was briefly imposed that October.",1,"The constitution guarantees religious freedom and bars discrimination based on religion. Rules requiring registration of religious organizations are not strictly enforced. However, members of the Muslim minority allege discrimination by officials and Christian residents, and police reportedly monitor mosques. Non-Christian groups are also denied airtime on state broadcasters. Construction of religious buildings must be approved by the government or local chiefs. Christian education is compulsory in public schools, and in 2017, the government banned the teaching of other religions in the public-school curriculum.",2,"Academic freedom is limited by restrictive laws such as the Suppression of Terrorism Act (STA) and the SSAA. Student activists face potential violence, arrest, and suspension. In January 2022, student activist Colani Maseko was reportedly brutally assaulted and arbitrarily detained by members of the security forces while on his way to university, prompting a wave of protests. He was accused of destroying photographs of the king and charged with “sedition and malicious damage to property”; Maseko was released on bail the following month.",1,"Constitutional rights to free expression are severely restricted in practice. Security agencies reportedly monitor personal communications, social media, and public gatherings, and criticism of the king or other elements of the regime can be punished under laws such as the SSAA, the STA, and the Public Order Act. Any criticism of Swazi culture and traditions or defacement of national symbols—including the king’s image—can draw fines and up to two years in prison. The government’s crackdown on dissent in response to the widespread prodemocracy protests in 2021 led to a further deterioration of free expression within the country. That June, the king issued a decree banning citizens from delivering petitions to the government, though officials denied that the ban was intended to prevent citizens from “raising grievances.” Prodemocracy activists continued to face harassment and arbitrary detentions throughout 2022.",1
ethiopia,"Independent journalists remain constrained by security imperatives that limit their ability to work and travel. While a 2021 media law adopted by the Abiy government seemed to offer a more liberal framework and protective legal environment for journalists, in practice this has not been the case. In April 2022, the parliament broke the terms of the media law and approved the appointment of members of the Prosperity Party to the board of the Ethiopian Media Authority (EMA). Under the law, EMA board members were supposed to be chosen in an open and transparent process.

International and Ethiopian journalists and media networks repeatedly come under government pressure over their coverage of the internal conflicts in Tigray and Oromo, as well as other political dynamics. In 2022, journalists in some cases were detained, expelled from the country, or had their licenses revoked. The EMA and security institutions warned and threatened media outlets reporting on the violent conflicts and pressured them to adhere to the government narrative. Journalists also faced pressure, arrests, threats, and harassment—both online and offline—from the government to disclose the identities of their sources.

Numerous Ethiopian journalists have been imprisoned without charges. In August 2022, the federal police announced that charges had been filed against 111 owners of “illegal” digital media outlets, accusing them of working to incite violence. Many self-censor or use pseudonyms to attempt to avoid persecution.

Most private media outlets are established with a goal of satisfying distinct political or ethnic group’s interests. Reports from state media agencies must follow the narrative of the ruling party; content that is contrary to the government’s narrative is removed.",1,"The Ethiopian constitution guarantees religious freedom, and different faith groups have coexisted in the country for centuries. However, religion has increasingly become a divisive factor in Ethiopian politics, and local conflicts have featured violence along religious lines. In April 2022, Muslim individuals were attacked in Gondar in the Amhara region by heavily armed assailants, resulting in the death of at least 20 civilians, over 150 people were injured, Muslim-owned properties were looted, and religious buildings were destroyed. In what was deemed a retaliatory attack, two Christians were killed and five Orthodox churches were burned in the Silte zone of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Regions (SNNPR).

In November 2022, Amharic speaking militants raided a protestant church in a village in the East Wollega Zone of Oromia and killed 15 participants of the church service, including church leaders.",1,"Academic freedom remains restricted in Ethiopia, though academics have become more vocal on political and economic matters in lectures, at conferences, in media columns, and online since the lifting of the state of emergency in 2018. However, self-censorship remains common in the context of ongoing conflicts and political tensions.

With few exceptions, institutions of higher education are funded and administered by the federal government, which also sets admission standards and student quotas. The Ministry of Education still monitors and regulates official curriculums. According to a September 2022 report from the Ethiopian Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, corruption is a widespread issue throughout higher education institutions.

University leadership has spread hate speech about ethnic Tigrayans and Oromo people. In June 2022, police attacked students at Addis Ababa University protesting ongoing ethnic violence against Amhara communities in the Wollega region. In August, Bonga University dismissed 54 Oromo students, following students’ demands for an investigation into the killing of an Oromo student on campus.",1,"The government silences critical voices and the voices of its political opponents to control the narratives around the civil war in Tigray and conflicts in other regions, especially Oromia. Its crackdown on individuals and political institutions with opposing views has pushed individuals to refrain from commenting on sensitive topics, including political issues.

Nationwide sweeps, raids, and arrests, as well as a rising tolerance for hate speech and incitement to violence by authorities and other public figures—particularly against Tigrayans and Oromo people—have intensified a climate of fear around expressing personal views. Government forces arrested over 4,500 individuals, including journalists and activists, during a May 2022 crackdown in the Amhara region. The crackdown was allegedly intended to disarm and demilitarize the Amhara militia known as the Fano, which had been recruited by the federal government to fight in the Tigray conflict and had likely committed war crimes. In August, authorities in the SNNPR arrested several Gurage Zone officials accusing them of favoring the Gurage regional government’s statehood demand.

Government security agencies surveil individuals and politicians through wire-tapping. Digital surveillance and the use of individual informants to spy on people is widespread. Ethiopian authorities purchased an Israeli surveillance system from the company Cellebrite, which they have used to hack into the mobile phones of detainees since 2021.",1
fiji,"Fiji has an active media sector, with several private television stations, radio stations, and newspapers. The political opposition and other critics of the FijiFirst government accused the state of using its power to silence critics. The vaguely worded Media Industry Development Decree bans reporting that is critical of the government or harmful to “national interest public order.” Restrictive press laws are sometimes enforced by the government, and the risk of fines and jail time encourages self-censorship. In August 2021, a former government advisor reported that the attorney general regularly tells the openly progovernment newspaper the Fiji Sun which stories to cover. Nevertheless, there has been a notable increase in articles critical of government in the national media in recent years.The Electoral (Amendment) Bill passed in September 2022 established rules for the publication of opinion polls and steep penalties for not complying with those rules that media and civil society organizations described as onerous and chilling.

The FijiFirst government continued in 2022 to withhold funding for the Fiji-based University of the South Pacific (USP) on the grounds that the university’s leadership had engaged in misconduct. Vice Chancellor Pal Ahluwalia had launched an investigation into irregularities under his predecessor, who was known to be close to the Fiji government. Though the government deported Ahluwalia, a Canadian citizen, in February 2021, he now runs the university from neighboring Samoa while living in exile. In December 2022, days after Rabuka was sworn in as prime minister, he invited Ahluwalia to return to Fiji and promised to restore the funds owed to USP by the government.",2,"The government places some constraints on free speech, such as a law banning the burning of the national flag.

A citizen petition against the law was not considered.Journalists sometimes face harassment for their work, notably those who cover topics related to immigrants and immigration. Journalists also face the risk of defamation charges. In April 2019, investigative reporter Johanna Vehkoo was convicted of defaming a far-right politician and ordered to pay more than $7,000 in fines and compensation.

In May 2022, Nika Gvaramia, head of the opposition television channel Mtavari Arkhi (Main Channel), was imprisoned on charges of abusing his position while working at Rustavi 2 TV station. The charges were widely viewed as politically motivated. Earlier, in January, the father of the founder of Pirveli TV was convicted of money laundering, in a case generally viewed as motivated by material on his son’s television station. There continue to be reports of officials denying access to journalists critical of government.The Ministry of Culture has increasingly been involved in efforts to suppress cultural expression. In 2022, the culture minister was accused of purging cultural institutions of employees for their views, with courts finding in favor of employees in wrongful dismissal lawsuits.

Such attacks were common in 2021 and 2022, especially against journalists reporting on far-right Querdenken (Lateral Thinking) demonstrations against COVID-19 restrictions.While press freedom in Germany remains robust, it has faced obstacles in recent years, including decreasing media pluralism. The privacy of communications between journalists and their sources has been affected by surveillance provisions in the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) Act, ruled unconstitutional in 2020.

In June 2021, the government passed new legislation allowing the federal police and intelligence services to use spyware to surveil encrypted online messaging services like WhatsApp. Critics have called the legislation unconstitutional, and several German media rights organizations have filed lawsuits asking the courts to prevent the intelligence services from secretly surveilling the private communications of individuals who are not suspected of criminal activity. The Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG) has repeatedly rejected such lawsuits. In April 2022, the BVerfG ruled that parts of a Bavarian law granting extensive surveillance powers to the domestic intelligence services in that state were unconstitutional in their scope.

A radio journalist, Oheneba Boamah Bennie, was sentenced by an Accra High Court for contempt of court and sentenced to 14 days in prison and a fine of approximately $400; another radio host, Kwabena Bobie Ansah, was arrested for publishing allegedly false news and for offensive conduct toward the first and second ladies of Ghana; another journalist, Sacut Amenga-Etego, was arrested and detained for illegally filming the premises of a High Court. A radio show host commonly known as “Captain Smart” was arrested and detained by the NIB for alleging that President Akufo-Addo was involved in an illegal mining operation.Violence against journalists included several reported cases of reporters being attacked by supporters of the NPP. In May 2022, three individuals assaulted Eric Blessing Eshun and Emmanuel Egyirfah during their live radio broadcast allegedly in retaliation for their coverage of the government’s management of issues related to the country’s fishing industry. Eshun was knocked unconscious during the attack, and the radio station was unable to broadcast for four days.",3,"Religious freedom is constitutionally and legally protected, and the government largely upholds these protections in practice.

greece,"The constitution includes provisions guaranteeing freedom of the press, and these are generally upheld in practice, though the law imposes some limits related to defamation, hate speech, and other such content. While citizens continue to enjoy access to a broad array of print, broadcast, and online news outlets, ownership concentration and editorial interference from owners remain concerns, and the government has been accused of directing public funds toward friendly private media.Journalists have been subject to assaults or other mistreatment, particularly while attempting to cover issues related to corruption and immigration. In 2022, reporter Thanasis Koukakis’s mobile phone was wiretapped and journalist Nektaria Stamouli’s reporting on surveillance and wiretapping incidents led to attempts to discredit her by a government spokesperson. The general secretary to the prime minister, Grigoris Dimitriadis, filed defamation lawsuits against investigative media and journalists following his resignation in August, asking them to retract all publications associating him with the wiretapping scandal and seeking more than half a million euros in compensation from defendants.Despite these incidents, the media environment remains highly free and plural, as demonstrated by robust investigative journalism that has shed light on surveillance and wiretapping incidents, including by Inside Story and Reporters United.",3,"The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, and this is generally respected in practice. However, the Orthodox Church of Greece—which has a special constitutional status as the “prevailing religion” of the country—receives government subsidies, and its clergy’s salaries and pensions are paid for by the state.

guatemala,"While the constitution protects freedom of speech, journalists self-censor when covering sensitive topics including drug trafficking, corruption, organized crime, and human rights violations. Public officials, illicit actors, the police, and individuals aligned with companies operating on Indigenous lands routinely threaten media workers. Attacks, threats and spurious legal cases against journalists increased during 2022. According to the Guatemalan Association of Journalists, as of August 2022, there had been 350 attacks on the press during the Giammattei administration. In March, criminal proceedings were filed against journalist Juan Luis Font alleging unlawful association with former anticorruption judge Erika Aifán. Font left the country for fear of harassment. In July 2022, leading independent journalist José Rubén Zamora, the founder and president of prominent newspaper elPeriódico, was arrested on financial crimes charges, and authorities raided his home and elPeriódico’s offices. In December, a judge ruled that Zamora must stand trial; he remained in detention at year’s end. Financial problems forced the paper to cease its print publication at the beginning of December. Zamora’s arrest has been widely condemned as an attempt by the government to stifle political dissent.The government made no progress in implementing the 2012 protection program for journalists. The Special Prosecutor’s Office for Crimes against Journalists is under-resourced and has been the target of surveillance. Rural, Indigenous, and women journalists are afforded little protection from discrimination, threats, and frivolous legal action, and reporters covering regional news suffered attacks and detentions on several occasions in 2022. Women journalists have been the target of sexual harassment on social media.Media ownership is highly concentrated, and independent media outlets face financial constraints due to decreasing advertisement revenue. The government has failed to act on a December 2021 ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) mandating that Indigenous communities be provided equitable access to radio frequencies. The country’s cybercrime laws have failed to protect outlets and reporters from harassment by trolls for hire, while public officials abuse unrelated laws to censor media outlets.

guinea,"The transitional charter commits to freedom and independence of the media, but in practice media freedom remains restricted. In 2022, several critical journalists reportedly faced arbitrary arrests, intimidation, questioning, and censorship by the security forces. Conakry’s new rulers have frequently called on the national communication authority (HAC) to issue suspensions against outlets that provided critical coverage. In addition, individual units of the military have visited the offices of newspapers and radio stations that produced critical reports, and intimidated journalists. The junta has further managed to skew media coverage in favor of the transitional authorities by selectively offering financial support. Separately, there were reports in 2022 that journalists covering demonstrations against the junta were attacked by protesters armed with rocks and knives.

guinea-bissau,"The constitution provides for freedom of the press, and there is some media diversity. However, journalists regularly face harassment and intimidation, including pressure regarding their coverage from political figures and government officials. Journalists and media facilities have been the target of violence.In recent years, armed men—some dressed in military clothing—have repeatedly attacked the privately owned Radio Capital FM station, which is allied to the opposition PAIGC, vandalizing its offices and destroying broadcasting equipment. In one such attack in February 2022, several people were injured while fleeing from the assailants, who were firing weapons in the broadcaster’s office. Privately owned radio stations are subject to steep annual licensing fees; nonpayment of fees can incur harsh criminal penalties, including up to three years’ imprisonment for the station’s owner. In April 2022, the government ordered the closure of 79 radio stations for nonpayment of broadcast licensing fees. The country’s journalists’ union denounced the closures as an attack on press freedom. All but two of the stations resumed broadcasting later that month after civil society organizations helped them negotiate staggered payments to the government.",1,"Religious freedom is legally protected and usually respected in practice.

haiti,"The constitution includes protections for press freedom, and the media sector is pluralistic, but the work of journalists is constrained by threats and violence, government interference, and a lack of financial resources. Attacks on journalists occur frequently, and impunity for perpetrators is the norm. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), seven journalists or media workers were murdered, died conducting a dangerous assignment, or died in other circumstances in 2022. In early January, for example, Wilguens Louis-Saint and John Wesley Amady were killed in Port-au-Prince, likely by gang members, while reporting on criminal activity. In September, a group of journalists reporting on gang violence in Port-au-Prince were ambushed, reportedly by members of the G9 an Fanmi e Alye; Frantzen Charles and Tayson Lartigue were killed and their bodies reportedly burned.Journalists also died when security forces tried to disperse protests. In February 2022, journalist Maximilien Lazard was shot as police used live ammunition on protesters in Port-au-Prince and later died at a hospital. Police in Port-au-Prince used tear gas to disperse a group of journalists who protested the detention of another journalist in October; Romelson Vilcin of Radio Génération 80 was struck by a tear-gas canister and killed, while police beat several protesters.",1,"Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed, and religious groups generally practice freely.

hungary,"The constitution protects freedom of the press, but Fidesz has undermined this guarantee. While privately owned opposition-aligned media outlets exist, national, regional, and local media are increasingly dominated by progovernment outlets, which are frequently used to smear political opponents and highlight false accusations. Government advertising and sponsorships favor progovernment outlets, leaving independent and critical news sources in a financially precarious position. Public service media controlled by the government has disseminated disinformation and Russian war propaganda since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.The Fidesz governing coalition and their allies have worked to close or acquire critical media outlets. The 2016 closure of Hungary’s largest independent daily, Népszabadság, represented a particularly serious blow to media diversity. In 2018, around 470 progovernment media outlets were merged under the Central European Press and Media Foundation (KESMA). Index, the country’s largest independent news outlet, was also taken over by progovernment forces in 2020. That year, the Media Council also revoked the broadcasting license of Klubrádió, the country’s largest independent radio station, forcing it off the air in February 2021.Changes to the “scaremongering” law in 2020, ostensibly to fight false or distorted information about the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately challenged journalists’ ability to secure reliable information, as many individuals, especially health care workers, feared retaliation if they provided information publicly. In July 2021, an investigation by a team of international journalists, including the Hungarian outlet Direkt36, revealed that independent journalists were surveilled by the Hungarian authorities using the Israeli-made spyware, Pegasus.Since 2010, Fidesz has gradually taken over artistic and cultural institutions and film and publishing industries and redirected funding for projects and artworks openly promoting nationalistic and Christian values.",2,"The constitution guarantees religious freedom and provides for the separation of church and state, though these guarantees were weakened in the 2011 version of the constitution, the preamble of which makes direct references to Christianity. Constitutional amendments enacted in 2018 and 2020 reinforced those references, obliging all state organs to protect “Christian culture” and guaranteeing children’s right to education based on Christian values.The government has led xenophobic campaigns in recent years, which has anti-Muslim sentiment.",3,"The Fidesz-led government has maintained its efforts to bring schools and universities under close supervision. A gradual overhaul of the public education system raised concerns about excessive government influence on school curriculums, and Parliament has restructured institutions and their finances to increase government-appointed chancellors’ powers. Authorities have increasingly threatened the academic autonomy of well-established institutions, pulling support, interfering in their affairs, and landing progovernment supporters in leading positions. The government has revoked accreditation from all gender studies programs.Progovernment media outlets commonly target activists, academics, programs, and institutions, often by calling them “Soros agents,” referring to Hungarian-born financier and philanthropist George Soros. Fidesz has targeted the Central European University (CEU), a graduate school founded by Soros, by changing the requirements for foreign universities to operate in Hungary. The government also targeted the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA), stripping the 200-year-old academy of its network of research institutions in 2019 and handing it over to a new governing body.A July 2022 ÁSZ report on “pink education” made the unfounded claim that the overrepresentation of women in higher education might cause demographic challenges and economic harm.",2,"While freedom of expression is constitutionally protected, ongoing efforts to sideline voices and perspectives that authorities find unfavorable, including many found at the MTA, CEU, NGOs, and media outlets, have discouraged open criticism of the government and other politically sensitive speech.In July 2021, an investigation by a team of international journalists revealed that journalists, businessmen, lawyers, and politicians were the targets of secret surveillance conducted with the Israeli-made spyware, Pegasus. A Fidesz parliamentarian in November of that year admitted the purchase of the spyware but denied allegations that it had been used on Hungarians. In January and June 2022, Hungarian authorities closed investigations into the allegations, claiming they had no evidence that any law had been broken in purchasing Pegasus. Hungary has failed to fully execute a 2016 European Court of Human Rights ruling to incorporate effective institutional guarantees against improper surveillance, which was reiterated by the court in another case in September 2022.",3

india,"The private media are somewhat vigorous and diverse, and investigations and scrutiny of politicians do occur. However, attacks on press freedom have escalated dramatically under the Modi government, and reporting has become significantly less ambitious in recent years. Authorities have used security, defamation, sedition, and hate speech laws, as well as contempt-of-court charges, to quiet critical voices in the media. Hindu nationalist campaigns aimed at discouraging forms of expression deemed “antinational” have exacerbated self-censorship. Online disinformation from inauthentic sources is ubiquitous ahead of elections. Separately, revelations of close relationships between politicians, business executives, and lobbyists, on one hand, and leading media personalities and owners of media outlets, on the other, have dented public confidence in the press.In addition to criminal charges, journalists risk harassment, death threats, and physical violence in the course of their work. Such attacks are rarely punished, and some have taken place with the complicity or active participation of police. In April 2022, the Article 14 news site said five of its journalists were escorted from a Hindu nationalist event in Delhi by police; demonstrators had attacked them when learning that most of them were Muslim. Police in Delhi later launched a case against Article 14 and journalist Meer Faisal for commenting on the incident on Twitter. Raids on independent outlets have become common. In October 2022, for example, police raided the New Delhi office of the Wire along with the homes of four of its editors. Police acted in response to a complaint lodged by BJP official Amit Malviya, who accused the Wire of defamation over retracted articles suggesting that he had the ability to remove Instagram posts.In June 2022, Mohammed Zubair, a cofounder of the Alt News fact-checking site, was arrested for allegedly inflaming religious sentiments via a Twitter post. A complainant accused Zubair, a Muslim, of showing disrespect to a Hindu deity. Zubair was later accused of using “offensive” language to describe Hindu religious leaders by the Uttar Pradesh police before receiving bail in July.",2,"While Hindus make up about 80 percent of the population, the Indian state is formally secular, and freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed. However, a number of Hindu nationalist organizations and some media outlets promote anti-Muslim views, a practice that the Modi government has been accused of encouraging. Attacks against Muslims and others in connection with the alleged slaughter or mistreatment of cows, which are held to be sacred by Hindus, continued in 2022. The BJP has faced criticism for failing to mount an adequate response to cow-related violence.Legislation in several states criminalizes religious conversions that take place as a result of “force” or “allurement,” which can be broadly interpreted to prosecute proselytizers. Some states require government permission for conversion.Communal rioting occurred in multiple states in April 2022, sparked by encounters between Muslims and those celebrating Hindu festivals.",2,"Academic freedom has significantly weakened in recent years, as professors, students, and institutions have faced intimidation over political and religious issues. Members of the student wing of the Hindu nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Association)—from which the ruling BJP is widely regarded to have grown—have engaged in violence on campuses across the country, including attacks on students and professors. University administrators and faculty have been investigated, disciplined, or compelled to step down owing to their perceived political views. Academics face pressure not to discuss topics deemed sensitive by the BJP government, particularly India’s relations with Pakistan and conditions in Indian Kashmir. The heads of prestigious academic institutions are increasingly selected for their loyalty to the ruling party.In February 2022, the Karnataka state government banned Muslim students from wearing the hijab in several public institutions. In October, the Supreme Court delivered a split verdict on the issue, with judges calling on the chief justice to send the case to a larger bench.",2,"Personal expression and private discussion in India had long been open and free. However, colonial-era and other laws are often invoked in order to penalize perceived criticism of the government by ordinary citizens. Activists, Muslims, and members of other marginalized communities are routinely charged with sedition for criticizing the government and its policies. In 2021, Article 14 reported a 28 percent annual increase in sedition charges from 2014, when the BJP came to power, to 2020. In May 2022, the Supreme Court put the colonial-era sedition law under review, stayed ongoing related cases, and asked the central and state governments to refrain from filing new cases. The court extended its order in October.Online “troll armies” associated with the BJP routinely harass individuals—notably Muslims—and organizations for voicing criticism of the government and for engaging in behavior that supposedly deviates from Hindu orthodoxy.The government has imposed rules that increase social media companies’ liability for material posted on their platforms and effectively encourage aggressive content restrictions. In July 2022, Twitter sued the government in the Karnataka High Court to contest orders to remove content critical of the government from its platform.A nationwide Central Monitoring System is meant to enable authorities to intercept digital communications in real time without judicial oversight. In 2021, a collaborative investigation by news organizations revealed that the government had likely planted Pegasus spyware on the mobile devices of more than 300 prominent individuals, including opposition members, journalists, judges, businesspeople, and minority-rights advocates. In August 2022, a committee of experts formed by the Supreme Court concluded that 5 of the 29 phones it examined were infected with malware but did not conclude if Pegasus was used; the Modi government did not cooperate with the committee.Also in August 2022, the government withdrew the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 from parliamentary consideration; among other provisions, it would have imposed restrictions on social media companies’ ability to use personal data, though it was criticized for proposing relatively few restrictions on the government itself. The BJP vowed to introduce a new bill to replace it.",3
indonesia,"Indonesia hosts a vibrant and diverse media environment, though legal and regulatory restrictions hamper press freedom. The 2008 Law on Electronic Information and Transactions (UU ITE) extended libel to online media. It also criminalized distribution or accessibility of information or documents “contrary to the moral norms of Indonesia,” or involving gambling, blackmail, or defamation. Journalists carrying out legitimate reporting have been arrested under the UU ITE. Foreign journalists visiting the Papua region face bureaucratic obstacles and deportation. Internet blackouts during protests as well as self-censorship have inhibited press activity. Journalists covering sensitive subjects, including LGBT+ issues, organized crime, sexual assault, and corruption, face harassment, violence, and threats. In March 2022, a student-run publication was shuttered by the State Islamic Institute in Ambon after it reported on sexual violence on campus. Two student journalists were physically assaulted on campus by men claiming to be relatives of an accused perpetrator. A 2020 directive allowed for up to 18 months’ imprisonment for “hostile information about the president and government” or coronavirus-related disinformation. In a 2022 report, Amnesty International Indonesia found that attacks against journalists where police officers were the alleged perpetrators increased in subsequent years.Journalists regularly face physical and digital attack. Amnesty International Indonesia documented 133 such incidents against 225 journalists and outlets between January 2019 and May 2022.",3,"Indonesia officially recognizes Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Individuals may leave the “religion” section on their identity cards blank, but those who do—including adherents of unrecognized faiths—often face discrimination. Atheism is not accepted legally. The criminal code passed in December 2022 prohibits blasphemy; those who “incite” someone to convert or refrain from religious adherence would face imprisonment.National and local governments often fail to protect religious minorities and exhibit bias in investigations and prosecutions. Building a new house of worship requires signatures of 90 congregation members and 60 local residents of different faiths. As of 2022, the government was still reconsidering the 2006 Joint Ministerial Decision on houses of worship, which has been cited as a driver of religious conflict.Violence and intimidation against Ahmadi and Shiite communities persists. In 2021, an Ahmadiyya mosque in West Kalimantan was destroyed by a mob. In January 2022, 21 people received four-and-a-half-month prison sentences over its destruction, leaving prison two weeks after sentencing for time served.",1,"Threats to academic freedom have increased in recent years. Hard-line groups and others are known to threaten discussions on LGBT+ matters, interfaith issues, Papua, police violence, and the 1965–66 anticommunist massacres.

Public academic discussions regarding Papua have been canceled and organizers surveilled and threatened. Students, student union leaders, and others involved in Papua-related campus protests continue to face intimidation, arrest, and treason charges, with authorities linking protests to secessionist movements.University rectors have reported pressure from the Education Ministry to curb student protests. The education minister’s vote accounts for 35 percent of the total vote share in the election of university rectors, making selection dependent upon their relationship with the ministry.A 2021 presidential regulation declared that Indonesia’s national philosophical ideology, Pancasila, would guide research and innovation policy. Academics fear authorities could use this decree to prohibit research deemed incompatible with Pancasila.",2,"Laws against blasphemy, defamation, and certain other forms of speech sometimes inhibit expression of personal views on sensitive topics, especially online. Amnesty International Indonesia reported that the UU ITE was used against at least 332 people between January 2019 and May 2022. Under the criminal code passed in December 2022, those who insult government institutions verbally or in writing would face imprisonment or fines. The new code would also prohibit public attacks on the “honor or dignity” of the president or vice president, including through technological means.In 2020, the National Police issued instructions to surveil activists online and engage in creating progovernment counternarratives. The 2021 creation of the Virtual Police unit within the National Police has reportedly led to self-censorship.Ministerial Regulation 5 (MR5) requires private digital services and platforms to register with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology or risk being blocked. Critics allege that MR5 poses privacy and freedom-of-speech risks and provides a tool for government to censor legitimate speech by placing undue burdens on platforms and services.Civil servants are subject to restrictions on online activity. A government task force reviews “radical” social media comments from civil servants, including perceived insults or criticisms of Pancasila, the state motto, the constitution, or the government. Civil servants cannot join organizations deemed to insult the country’s governing principles.The government is known to surveil and detain individuals who discuss separatism in Maluku or Papua or fly the Papuan Morning Star or the Republic of South Maluku flag. In August 2022, seven people were convicted of treason for raising the Morning Star and received 10-month prison terms.",3
iran,"Media freedom is severely limited both online and offline. The state broadcasting company is tightly controlled by hard-liners and influenced by the security apparatus. News and analysis are heavily censored, while critics and opposition members are rarely, if ever, given a platform on state-controlled television, which remains a major source of information for many Iranians. State television has a record of airing confessions extracted from political prisoners under duress, and it routinely carries reports aimed at discrediting dissidents and opposition activists.Newspapers and magazines face censorship and warnings from authorities about which topics to cover and how. Tens of thousands of foreign-based websites are filtered, including news sites and major social media services. Satellite dishes are banned, and Persian-language broadcasts from outside the country are regularly jammed. Police periodically raid private homes and confiscate satellite dishes. Iranian authorities have intimidated journalists working for Persian-language media outside the country, in part by summoning and threatening their families in Iran.Amid the nationwide protests that began in September 2022, authorities arrested dozens of journalists, and at least 62 were behind bars of as of early December, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Shargh newspaper reporter Niloofar Hamedi, who was among the first to report about Amini’s hospitalization, and Hammihan reporter Elahe Mohammadi, who was attempting to cover Amini’s funeral, were among those arrested. Authorities also attempted to suppress coverage of the protest movement by imposing severe restrictions on internet services, including curbs on access to the social media platforms Instagram and WhatsApp.",0,"Iran is home to a majority Shiite Muslim population and Sunni Muslim, Baha’i, Christian, and Zoroastrian minorities. The constitution recognizes only Zoroastrians, Jews, and certain Christian communities as non-Muslim religious minorities, and these small groups are relatively free to worship. The regime cracks down on Muslims who are deemed to be at variance with the state ideology and interpretation of Islam.Sunni Muslims complain that they have been prevented from building mosques in major cities and face difficulty obtaining government jobs. In recent years, there has been increased pressure on the Sufi Muslim order Nematollahi Gonabadi, including destruction of its places of worship and the jailing of some of its members. In September 2022, new charges were brought against jailed journalist Kasra Nouri, a member of the Gonabadi dervish community, who had been arrested in 2018 following violent clashes between dervishes and security forces. The new charges accused Nouri of signing a statement with other political prisoners.The government also subjects some non-Muslim minority groups to repressive policies and discrimination, including Baha’is and unrecognized Christian groups. Baha’is are systematically persecuted, sentenced to prison, and banned from access to higher education.

Khamenei has warned that universities should not be turned into centers for political activities. Students have been prevented from continuing their studies for political reasons or because they belong to the Baha’i community. Foreign scholars visiting Iran are vulnerable to detention on trumped-up charges. Since Raisi became president, students have reported tighter restrictions, including stricter hijab rules, which prompted protests in April 2022. Separately, in January it was reported that three university professors who were widely praised for their work had been dismissed, allegedly for political reasons. In June, an appeals court upheld 16-year prison sentences for two elite university students who had been convicted in April of endangering national security, destroying public facilities, cooperating with opposition groups, and other charges that were rejected by their families. Amnesty International said the two, Ali Younesi and Amirhossein Moradi, had been tortured in detention and held in prolonged solitary confinement.As part of their efforts to suppress the nationwide protests that began in September, authorities raided university campuses and arrested several hundred students.",1,"Iran’s vaguely defined restrictions on speech, harsh criminal penalties, and state monitoring of online communications are among several factors that deter citizens from engaging in open and free private discussion. Despite the risks and limitations, many do express dissent on social media, in some cases circumventing official blocks on certain platforms.In September 2022, the Supreme Council for Cyberspace quietly implemented three articles of a draft bill under consideration by the parliament, establishing a reorganized regulatory commission that included representatives of the security forces and had extensive authority over online content and services.After mass protests began later in September, authorities arrested thousands of people, including celebrities, human rights defenders, and others who had expressed support for the movement through posts on social media or by publicly disobeying the hijab requirements that had led to Mahsa Amini’s arrest and death. The IRGC called on the judiciary to prosecute anyone spreading “false news and rumors.” ",0
iraq,"Iraq’s media environment appears lively and diverse, but there are few politically independent news sources. In recent years, social media has been utilized to spread fake news and explicit threats against activists, particularly by Iran-backed militias. Media outlets face restrictions and obstruction in response to their coverage.

The Iraqi authorities have assaulted, detained, or arrested journalists for their work, at times charging them with defamation and insulting public institutions. Militias shoot, kidnap, torture, and assassinate reporters for their work, and supporters of political parties and militias occasionally attack journalists. In May 2022, Iraqi journalist Ali al-Dhabhawi was arrested in Baghdad, after he criticized Iraqi militias on his television program Studio 9.

As of April 2022, three journalists were serving prison sentences for conducting their work, convicted by the KRG authorities. KRG authorities routinely beat, harass, and arbitrarily arrest, detain, and sentence journalists without due process. While local journalists bear most of the brunt of repression by Iraqi and Kurdish authorities, occasionally foreign journalists are hindered from doing their work as well. Throughout 2022, several journalists and news websites that have published on corruption in Iraqi Kurdistan were targeted by cyberattacks.",1,"The constitution guarantees freedom of belief, but in practice many Iraqis experience violence and displacement due to their religious identity. The Baha’i community continues to suffer from legal discrimination, as its religious activity continues to be banned, and Baha’is are not recognized as members of a minority religion, preventing them from registering themselves. Since Baha’i marriages are unregistered, children born to such marriages effectively become stateless.

Blasphemy laws remain in the legal code, although enforcement is rare. Children with one Muslim parent, including converts, are automatically designated as Muslim. Conversion from Islam to another religion is banned by law. Atheists largely hide their lack of religious belief due to societal stigma and persecution.",1,Educators have long faced the threat of violence or other repercussions for teaching subjects or discussing topics that powerful state or nonstate actors find objectionable. The country’s official curriculum is often augmented in the classroom by religious or sectarian viewpoints. Political activism by university students can result in harassment or intimidation.,1,"Commentary on controversial topics, including on social media, are considered to be off limits and at times prompt arrest, docking of salaries, torture, and criminal lawsuits. Social media users and bloggers have faced defamation suits from government officials for criticizing corruption and misgovernance. Authorities have released video footage of detainees to humiliate and intimidate them.

Activists across Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan describe a climate of fear that has led them to self-censor. Authorities arrest individuals, some of them ordinary citizens with no background in activism, shortly after they post messages critical of authorities on social media, including the app Clubhouse, indicating that Iraqi and Kurdish authorities are constantly monitoring online platforms. In December 2022, in a landmark case, a Baghdad court sentenced Haidar al-Zaidi to three years in prison for a post on Twitter criticizing the former head of PMF. “Electronic armies” working on behalf of powerful actors across Iraq have also abused systems of reporting on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to remove the pages or suspend private profiles of critics.

However, surveillance is not restricted to social media. Over the past year, Kurdish authorities have arrested and dismissed mosque preachers for their criticism of the ruling regime and absence of basic services. Over 30 private citizens involved in the 2019 Tishreen protest movement, including at least one minor, were abducted between 2019 to 2021; their whereabouts remained unknown as of December 2022.

In May 2022, the Iraqi parliament passed a law prohibiting normalization with Israel, which also criminalized any speech, including on social media, advocating such normalization.",1
ireland,"Irish media are free and independent, and present a variety of viewpoints. However, the media sector is highly concentrated, with one company—Independent News and Media—controlling much of the newspaper market.Ireland’s restrictive defamation laws continue to receive criticism. In March 2022, the Justice Minister received government approval to reform the Defamation Act 2009; an amendment bill was in preparation late in the year. Sinn Féin has been accused by rival parties of the strategic use of defamation cases against broadcast outlets to quash negative press, and in May 2022, the Index on Censorship issued a media freedom alert with the Council of Europe (CoE) regarding one such case.",4,"Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed. Although religious oaths are still required from senior public officials, there is no state religion, and adherents of other faiths face few impediments to religious expression. In recent years, the Roman Catholic Church has notably declined in the public eye, following a series of sexual abuse and other scandals involving the Church and its clergy.",4,"Academic freedom is respected. The Roman Catholic Church operates approximately 90 percent of Ireland’s schools, most of which include religious education from which parents may exempt their children. The constitution requires equal funding for schools run by different denominations.",4,"There are no significant impediments to open and free private discussion, including in personal online communications. However, Ireland’s national identity card, the Public Services Card (PSC), has elicited controversy due to data storage and privacy concerns. In December 2021, the government acceded to a finding by the Irish Data Protection Commission that the PSC could not be made a mandatory requirement for accessing services. The government also agreed to make changes to the way it processes card data.",4
israel,"The Israeli media sector is vibrant and free to criticize government policy. While the scope of permissible reporting is generally broad, print articles on security matters are subject to a military censor. According to official statistics released in June 2022, the military partially redacted a total of 1,313 news items and fully barred publication of 129 others in 2021, out of 7,413 stories submitted for review; the figures represented an 11-year low. The Government Press Office has occasionally withheld press cards from journalists to restrict them from entering Israel, citing security considerations.Despite the existence of robust legal protections for journalists, Netanyahu’s tenure as prime minister negatively affected the public’s trust in the media, which Netanyahu and his allies portrayed as traitors seeking to unseat him. As a result, journalists describe being discouraged from reporting on topics that were perceived to be sympathetic to Palestinians, or frame reporting in a way that would not seem “leftist.” Netanyahu’s efforts to undermine the independence of Israel’s national broadcaster Kan and financially weaken commercial television channels have had a chilling effect on the desire of these media outlets to investigate misconduct or corruption allegations implicating influential politicians.Most Israeli media outlets are not financially independent, and are affected by the commercial interest of their owners, sometimes resulting in coverage biased toward the owners’ business and political interests. In one recent example, the editor in chief of Yedioth Ahronoth and Ynet, businessman Nochi Dankner, and the owner of the Walla! News websites, Shaul Alowitz, attempted to secure regulatory favors from then prime minister Netanyahu in exchange for favorable coverage. Legal cases against the three, who were indicted on several corruption charges, were ongoing at the end of 2022.",3,"While Israel defines itself as a Jewish state, freedom of religion is largely respected. Christian, Muslim, Druze, and Baha’i communities have jurisdiction over their own members in matters of marriage, divorce, and burial. The Orthodox establishment governs personal status matters among Jews, drawing objections from many non-Orthodox Israelis. Orthodox parties have enough political power to block government decisions relating to religion and the state; for example, despite majority support from the Israeli public, no civil or gay marriage exists in Israel, and public transportation is largely unavailable on the Sabbath or religious holidays. Although the law protects the religious sites of non-Jewish groups, they face discrimination in the allocation of state resources as well as persistent cases of vandalism or harassment, which usually go unsolved.Citing security concerns, Israeli authorities have set varying limits on access to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in East Jerusalem in recent years, affecting worshippers across the broader area. During 2021 and 2022, Israeli authorities had increasingly allowed Jewish prayer at the site without openly announcing a change in policy, and the number of Jewish worshippers ascending to the Mount has increased. At the Western Wall of the compound, long a site of Jewish prayer, rival advocacy groups have been engaged in an ongoing dispute over access for women and non-Orthodox Jewish worshippers.",3,"Primary and secondary education is universal, though divided into multiple public school systems (state, state-religious, independent religious, Arabic-Christian, Arabic-Druze, and Arabic-Muslim) as well as private schools. School quality and resources are generally lower in mostly non-Jewish communities. A 2018 law bans groups that are in favor of legal action abroad against Israeli soldiers, or that otherwise undermine state educational goals by criticizing the military, from entering Israeli schools or interacting with students. Attempts to influence or restrict academic freedom at universities are generally blocked.",3,"While private discussion in Israel is generally open and free, there are some restrictions on political expression. For example, the 2011 Boycott Law exposes Israeli individuals and groups to civil lawsuits if they advocate an economic, cultural, or academic boycott of the state of Israel or West Bank settlements.The Haaretz newspaper has reported that police have targeted current and former government officials, businesspeople, and others with the Pegasus spyware, which was developed by an Israeli company.",3

There are more than 100 daily newspapers, most of them locally or regionally based, as well as political party papers, free papers, and weekly publications. Concentration of ownership remains a major concern. Internet access is generally unrestricted. The frequency of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs)—lawsuits used to intimidate or silence journalists and others who publicize matters of public interest—poses a threat to investigative journalism.",3,"Religious freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and respected in practice. There is no official religion; while the Roman Catholic Church receives certain benefits under a treaty with the state, other groups have access to similar benefits through their own accords. Some local governments have raised obstacles to the construction and recognition of mosques, and right-wing political parties have stoked anti-Muslim attitudes. Antisemitic acts have also trended upward in recent years.",4,Academic freedom is generally respected.,4,People are typically able to freely discuss controversial or sensitive topics in public without fear of surveillance or retribution.,4
jamaica,"The constitutional right to free expression is generally respected. Most newspapers are privately owned and express a variety of views. Broadcast media are largely publicly owned but are similarly vibrant.In October 2022, the BC banned radio stations from playing music deemed to glorify lottery scamming, illegally owned firearms, or the use of illicit drugs. The MAJ strongly criticized the ban, saying the BC did not consult the music industry and was curtailing expression.",4,"Freedom of religion is constitutionally protected and generally respected in practice. Laws banning Obeah, an Afro-Caribbean shamanistic religion, remain on the books but are not actively enforced.",4,The government does not restrict academic freedom.,4,"Individuals are generally free to express their personal views on political or other sensitive topics. However, the presence of powerful criminal groups in some urban neighborhoods can discourage people from openly discussing criminal activities.The government has worked to introduce the NIDS for several years. Revised legislation, which made enrollment voluntary, was passed in 2021; in 2019, the Supreme Court struck a previous NIDS-related law for violating Jamaicans’ privacy. The government implemented NIDS on a pilot basis in December 2022, with Prime Minister Holness promising that user information would be secure.",3
japan,"Freedom of the press is guaranteed in the constitution, and Japan has a highly competitive media sector. However, press freedom advocates have criticized a 2014 law that allows journalists to be prosecuted for revealing state secrets, even if the information was unknowingly obtained. A 2017 report by the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression noted concern about pressure on the media from the government, and recommended the repeal of Article 4 of the Broadcast Act, which gives the government the power to determine what information is “fair” and thus acceptable for public broadcast. Under the traditional kisha kurabu (press club) system, institutions such as government ministries and corporate organizations have restricted the release of news to journalists and media outlets with membership in their clubs. While the club system has been criticized for privileging the major dailies and other established outlets that belong to it and potentially encouraging self-censorship, in recent years online media and weekly newsmagazines have challenged the daily papers’ dominance of political news with more aggressive reporting.",3,"Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, and there are no substantial barriers to religious practice or the expression of nonbelief. The constitution also stipulates that no religious organization shall receive any privileges from the state.In July 2022, during a campaign rally for a candidate in the upper house elections, former prime minister Shinzō Abe was assassinated. The gunman, who was quickly detained, reportedly blamed the Unification Church for bankrupting his family through its controversial extraction of donations and other revenue from adherents, and he targeted Abe because the former leader had a close political relationship with the church. Subsequent news reports revealed links between many LDP politicians and the Unification Church, raising concerns about their tacit endorsement or protection of the religious group’s practices. In a cabinet reshuffle in August, Kishida dismissed seven ministers who had disclosed connections to the church. The LDP conducted its own investigation, stating in September that 179 of its 379 members of parliament had disclosed links to the church and related organizations.",4,"Academic freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and mostly respected in practice, but education and textbooks have long been a focus of public and political debate. While there is not a national curriculum or single official history text, the Ministry of Education’s screening process has approved textbooks that downplay Japan’s history of imperialism and war atrocities.",4,The government generally does not restrict personal expression or private discussion. Some observers have raised concerns that antiterrorism and anticonspiracy legislation that went into effect in 2017 could permit undue surveillance.,4
jordan,"Jordanian media laws are restrictive, vague, and arbitrarily enforced. Various statutes penalize defamation, criticism of the king or state institutions, harming Jordan’s relations with foreign states, blasphemy, and any content considered to lack objectivity. Authorities appoint the editors and control the finances of several media outlets. Government gag orders and informal instructions to editors regarding news coverage are common, and journalists are routinely arrested for violating such orders. News sites face onerous registration requirements that, if not met, can serve as a justification for blocking. Journalists rarely face serious violence or significant jail time for their work, but they often practice self-censorship.In 2022, journalists were harassed or arrested repeatedly for reporting on a variety of topics that the regime deems taboo. Family members and friends of reporters who challenge the regime have been reportedly threatened with loss of employment and difficulties renewing work visas or other official documents.",1,"Islam is the state religion. The government monitors sermons at mosques for political, sectarian, or extremist content and issues prescribed texts and themes. Muslim clerics require government authorization to preach or dispense religious guidance. Many Christian groups are recognized as religious denominations or associations and can worship freely, though they cannot proselytize among Muslims. While converts from Islam are not prosecuted for apostasy, they face bureaucratic obstacles and harassment in practice. Unrecognized religious groups are allowed to practice their faiths but face disadvantages stemming from their lack of legal status. Atheists and agnostics are required to list a religious affiliation on government documents.

The telecommunications law requires companies to enable the tracking of private communications upon the issuance of a court order, and authorities are allowed to order surveillance of people suspected of terrorism. Many Jordanians believe that government agents routinely listen to their phone calls and monitor their online activities. Jordan’s Cybercrime Law, the Crime Prevention Law, and the penal code allow officials to detain citizens at will.Under cybercrime legislation, internet users can face fines or prison terms of up to three months if they are convicted of defamation for online comments. Human Right Watch investigated 30 cases between 2019 and 2022 in which activists and protesters were arrested and charged with defamation related to social media posts or views expressed in public gatherings. Pegasus spyware, created by the Israeli company NSO Group, was reportedly used to hack the phones of four human rights activists, lawyers, and journalists from 2019 through 2021; Jordanian government agencies are suspected of being behind these attacks.Restrictions on other social media apps, some permanent, are common. Following violence at protests in December 2022, authorities suspended the social media platform TikTok.",2
kazakhstan,"Media independence is severely limited in Kazakhstan. While the constitution provides for freedom of the press, most of the media sector is controlled by the state or government-friendly owners. Independent outlets and journalists are routinely shut down or harassed, and self-censorship is common. Defamation was decriminalized in 2020, but libel remains a criminal offense, and the criminal code prohibits insulting the president and other officials. The authorities also use internet blackouts to restrict access to media outlets. Following the January 2022 violence, the government shut down internet access across the country for five days.Journalists are required to confirm the accuracy of information prior to publication by consulting with relevant government bodies or officials, obtain consent for the publication of personal or otherwise confidential information, and acquire accreditation as foreign journalists if they work for foreign outlets. They are also required to work with a “host” when reporting on government events.In November 2022, just after the presidential election, the offices of independent media outlet Elmedia in Almaty were attacked twice in two weeks by unknown assailants. The offices had also been vandalized in October.",0,"The constitution guarantees freedom of worship, and some religious communities practice without state interference. However, activities by unregistered religious groups are banned, and registered groups are subject to close government supervision. The government has broad authority to outlaw organizations it designates as “extremist.” The 2011 Law on Religious Activities and Religious Associations prohibited the distribution of religious literature outside places of worship, required the state approval of all religious literature, and prohibited unregistered missionary activity, among other provisions. In January 2022, amendments to the law came into force, placing further bureaucratic restrictions on holding religious meetings in unregistered places of worship.Local officials continue to harass groups defined as “nontraditional,” including Protestant Christians, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Muslims who do not adhere to the government-approved version of Islam. According to Forum 18, an NGO that tracks religious freedom in Eurasia, authorities have arrested and imprisoned 75 alleged members of Sunni Muslim group Tablighi Jamaat since 2015, destroying all their books and religious materials.",1,"Academic freedom remains constrained by political sensitivities surrounding certain topics, including former president Nazarbaev and his inner circle, as well as relations with Russia.

kenya,"Kenya has one of the more vibrant media landscapes on the African continent, with journalists actively working to expose government corruption and wrongdoing. However, several laws restrict press freedom. The government and security forces regularly harass journalists, and such incidents are rarely investigated by police. The combination of restrictive laws on press freedom and the potential for harassment and violence leads to self-censorship in some cases. Women journalists generally face greater harassment and risk of attack.Two journalists were assaulted in March 2022 while covering an event at Azimio headquarters. In October, Pakistani journalist Arshad Sharif was shot and killed by police in Nairobi at a roadblock; Pakistani authorities later claimed that Sharif’s death had been a targeted killing. According to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), investigations into Sharif’s death were ongoing as of December.Media outlets have expressed concern about Ruto’s relationship with local press: his team has repeatedly stated that Kenyan media is biased against him, and in March 2022, his United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party temporarily barred journalists from covering its national delegates convention. The Media Council of Kenya reported that in the months leading up to the election, Odinga received significantly more media attention than Ruto during the campaign, although the tone of political reporting was generally neutral.",2,"The government generally respects the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion.

kuwait,"Kuwaiti law assigns penalties for the publication of material that insults Islam, criticizes the emir, discloses information considered secret or private, or calls for the regime’s overthrow. Journalists also risk imprisonment under the restrictive 2016 Cyber Crimes Law, which criminalizes the dissemination of similar content online. In June 2022, the authorities withdrew the licenses of 90 news websites and referred 73 media outlets to state prosecutors for alleged legal violations, including the publication of false news.Thousands of books have been banned in the country for political or moral reasons, though a 2020 legal amendment requires a judicial order—rather than a government decision—to enforce such a ban.The media regulator, the Commission for Mass Communications and Information Technology, has sweeping powers to monitor, block, and censor online material. The government can seek the revocation of a media outlet’s license via the judiciary. Foreign media outlets operate relatively freely in Kuwait. In September 2022, Kuwait’s government joined the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in demanding that Netflix remove “offensive content” from its video-streaming service, citing material that “violates Islamic and societal values and principles.”",1,"Islam is the state religion, and blasphemy is a punishable offense. Defamation of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism is prohibited. The government appoints Sunni imams and oversees their sermons.

kyrgyzstan,"The media landscape is relatively diverse but divided along ethnic lines, and prosecutions for inciting ethnic hatred have tended to focus on minority writers despite the prevalence of openly racist and antisemitic articles in Kyrgyz-language media. A 2014 law criminalized the publication of “false information relating to a crime or offense” in the media, which international monitors saw as a contradiction of the country’s 2011 decriminalization of defamation. The law assigns penalties of up to three years in prison, or five years if the claim serves the interests of organized crime or is linked to the fabrication of evidence.

Journalists and bloggers covering major events, including ongoing corruption cases, the COVID-19 response, and elections have regularly faced intimidation, detention, physical attack, and interference as they conducted their work. In January 2022, one of the country’s leading anticorruption journalists, Bolot Temirov, was arrested on drug charges days after publishing a video accusing family members of Kamchybek Tashiev, the head of the GKNB, of corruption. In September, the charges against Temirov were thrown out by a Bishkek court; the presiding judge noted that the charges were clearly fabricated. Despite being cleared of the drug charges, Temirov was convicted of “illegal border crossing” for allegedly falsifying the documents he used to obtain his Kyrgyzstani passport; he was stripped of his Kyrgyzstani citizenship in November and forcibly deported to Russia, an action that his family compared to a forced abduction.

The parliament passed new legislation on “false information” in 2021 under the direct guidance of Japarov and in violation of parliamentary procedure. The controversial law grants an unspecified government body the power to order service providers to block information deemed “false” by authorities and to create a database of those associated with online activity—including alleged defamation—that officials have flagged. Human rights activists claim that the legislation provides for legal censorship outside the courts.

In 2022, the parliament began considering new legislation that would require all media organizations to reapply for registration and impose specific limitations on outlets that receive funding from abroad. In October, a petition to the president purportedly authored by a lawmaker and signed by a large group of journalists and cultural figures demanded the closure of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s (RFE/RL) Kyrgyz service as well as two local independent outlets, Kloop and Kaktus.media.

Groups outside the traditional Muslim and Orthodox Christian mainstream reportedly have difficulty obtaining registration, and the 2009 Law on Religion deems all unregistered groups illegal. Organizations such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses often face police harassment. The government also monitors and restricts some Islamic groups, including the nonviolent Islamist movement Hizb ut-Tahrir and Yakyn Inkar, which practices strict asceticism.

Libel remains a criminal offense.Lagging media literacy, the spread of hate speech, and an increase in online attacks against journalists are growing concerns.In June 2022, the Latvian regulatory authorities banned retransmission of all Russia-based television channels until the end of the war in Ukraine and the return of Crimea to Ukraine. They have also blocked numerous websites, including kremlin.ru, an official Russian site.However, between the start of the war in Ukraine and July 2022, more than 200 journalists and 23 media organizations emigrated to Latvia from Russia. In December, Latvian authorities revoked the broadcast license of TV Rain, an independent Russian channel operating in Latvia—a move criticized by both by local and international journalist organizations.",3,"Freedom of religion is generally respected.In September 2022, the Saeima amended the Law of the Latvian Orthodox Church to make it fully independent from the Moscow Patriarchate.",4,"While academic freedom is largely upheld, lawmakers have begun to place some limitations on instruction in recent years.Following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Latvian authorities accelerated the transition to Latvian-only instruction in all schools, including at the preschool level. In September 2022, the Saeima passed amendments shortening the transition from six years to two. Up to 30 percent of teachers in schools that teach in minority languages lack sufficient Latvian language skills and could face penalties or dismissal.",3,"There are few restrictions on personal expression or private discussion. However, legal constraints include a ban on the public display of Soviet or Nazi symbols as well as prohibitions on incitement to ethnic hatred and denial of historical crimes.By October 2022, Government authorities had launched around 30 criminal proceedings against individuals who allegedly supported the war in Ukraine, including by posting videos on social media expressing approval of the invasion. By October the State Security Service had banned more than 200 people from Latvia for similar reasons, and in December it warned the parliamentary party For Stability! that its operations could be terminated due to allegedly prowar comments by its members of parliament.",4
lebanon,"Press freedom is constitutionally guaranteed but inconsistently upheld. While the country’s media are among the most open and diverse in the region, nearly all outlets depend on the patronage of political parties, wealthy individuals, or foreign powers, and consequently practice some degree of self-censorship. Books, movies, plays, and other artistic works are subject to censorship, especially when the content involves politics, religion, sex, or Israel, and the artists responsible for work deemed controversial by the government or major religious groups face official interference. It is a criminal offense to criticize or defame the president or security services. Authorities sometimes use such laws to harass and detain journalists, and those detained are often forced to sign pledges to refrain from writing content viewed as defamatory by the government.Authorities have failed to protect the media from violence or intimidation by members of political, religious, and other influential groups. Both security forces and supporters of political parties have attacked reporters covering protests, and several journalists have experienced harassment and threats of violence online. Despite the legal and practical obstacles they face, many journalists have been able to report and comment on sensitive topics such as state corruption, elite malfeasance, and the behavior of armed factions like Hezbollah. However, the financial viability of their work has been threatened by the economic collapse.",2,"The constitution protects freedom of conscience, and the state does not typically interfere with the practice or expression of religious faith or nonbelief. While blasphemy is a criminal offense, enforcement varies and is generally lax. Individuals may face societal pressure to express faith or allegiance to a confessional community. Leaders and members of different communities discourage proselytizing by other groups.",3,"Academic freedom is generally unimpaired. Individuals are mostly free to select subjects for research and disseminate their findings. However, various laws and customary standards—including restrictions on defamation, blasphemy, and work or opinions related to Israel—limit debate on certain issues. The state does not engage in extensive political indoctrination through education, though religious and other nonstate entities do seek to reinforce communal identities and perspectives.",3,"Private discussion and public expression of personal views on political and other controversial topics have been increasingly inhibited in recent years. Repressive laws that criminalize defamation or otherwise restrict speech remain on the books, and individuals sometimes face police questioning, arrests, short detentions, or fines if they criticize the government, the military, foreign heads of state, or other powerful entities. Noncitizens, including refugees and migrant workers, have fewer legal protections and may be especially reluctant to engage in speech that could draw the attention of the security services.Lebanese authorities regularly monitor social media and electronic communications—including those of prominent individuals such as politicians, dissidents, and journalists. Security personnel have reportedly infiltrated the social media groups of activists and protesters in recent years.Authorities also fail to protect people from nonstate actors, such as political parties or militant groups and their supporters, that may monitor and punish them for expressing critical opinions. Since the outbreak of mass protests against corruption and governance failures in 2019, journalists, activists, and outspoken social media users have faced physical attacks and online threats or harassment by such powerful groups.",2
lesotho,"Press freedom is indirectly protected under constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. However, journalists are subject to threats and intimidation from the authorities and private citizens, and women journalists are often harassed offline and online. The long-postponed trial of four soldiers allegedly behind the 2016 attempted murder of former Lesotho Times and Sunday Express editor, Lloyd Mutungamiri, was further delayed in 2022.Journalists additionally face statutory barriers that interfere in their work, including criminal code provisions that bar sedition and offenses against the “dignity of the royal family.” The Penal Code, adopted in 2010, allows police officers to force journalists to reveal their sources. According to the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) Lesotho, several long-awaited media reforms were quietly dropped from an omnibus reform bill that Parliament attempted to pass during the year, which MISA saw as a missed opportunity to address existing challenges.",2,"The constitution provides legal protections for freedom of religion and prohibits religious discrimination, and religious freedom is generally upheld in practice.",4,"Academic freedom is generally respected in practice, though the government does interfere in the administration of institutions of higher education.",3,"The constitution provides legal protections for freedom of expression. However, political violence in recent years has discouraged open political debate. In May 2022, the National Assembly passed and sent to the Senate the Computer Crimes and Cyber Security Bill. Local civil society organizations criticized the legislation as overly broad and reminiscent of previous criminal defamation laws. The bill was still being deliberated at year-end.  In October 2022, the government reportedly sought to cancel a controversial 500 million Loti ($30.7 million) tender to the Global Voice Group (GVG), whose technology would have enabled the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) to spy on citizens and monitor their online financial transactions illegally. The government claimed that the tender was fraudulently awarded by the former chief executive of the LCA, ‘Mamarame Matela.",3
liberia,"Liberia’s constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, but these rights are sometimes restricted in practice. Investigative reporters receive threats, including by members of the government who have vowed to sue in response to journalistic inquiries. Although the 2019 Press Freedom Act effectively decriminalized libel, “sedition,” and “criminal malevolence,” defamation remains a civil offense, and journalists risk jail time for nonpayment. Investigative reporting can lead to media houses being summoned to court.Law enforcement agencies constitute a major source of security problems for journalists. In June 2022, police threatened to shoot two journalists who were covering the Lofa County by-elections. In July, journalist Bettie K.

libya,"There is a diverse array of Libyan media outlets based inside and outside the country. However, most are highly partisan, producing content that favors one of the country’s political and military factions, and in many cases promoting propaganda, hate speech, or disinformation in coordination with foreign backers. Social media accounts linked to the rival political groups and their foreign supporters have also disseminated such content. In September 2022, the HoR adopted Law No. 5 of 2022, a controversial cybercrime measure that empowered the authorities to block and censor content—and impose criminal punishments—based on vague violations of “public order and morality.”The years of civil conflict and related violence by criminal and extremist groups have made objective reporting dangerous, and journalists and commentators are subject to intimidation, arbitrary detention, and physical abuse by a variety of armed actors. In August 2022, LAAF fighters allegedly abducted the sister of Nadine al-Farsi, a human rights activist from Benghazi who had continued to antagonize Haftar’s forces through her online commentary after fleeing the country. The sister and her children had apparently not been released as of late 2022.",1,"Religious freedom is often violated in practice. Nearly all Libyans are Sunni Muslims, but Christian and other minority communities have been attacked by armed groups, including local affiliates of the Islamic State (IS) militant group. In eastern Libya, hard-line Salafi Muslims aligned with Haftar’s forces control Benghazi’s mosques and religious programming. Salafi militants, who reject the veneration of saints, have destroyed or vandalized Sufi Muslim shrines with impunity.",1,"There are no effective laws guaranteeing academic freedom. The armed conflict has damaged many school and university facilities and altered classroom dynamics; for example, professors can be subject to intimidation by students who are aligned with militias. Self-censorship is common among educators. Among other operational challenges, educational institutions have limited access to independent funding for reconstruction, training, and salaries, which increases their vulnerability to political pressure.",1,"Although the freedom of private discussion and personal expression improved dramatically after 2011, ongoing militia activity has taken its toll, with many Libyans withdrawing from public life or avoiding criticism of powerful figures. Numerous kidnappings and killings of activists, politicians, and journalists have added to the general deterrent effect. Conditions for personal expression are considerably worse in the east than in the west, where residents have somewhat more freedom to criticize government authorities, though violent reprisals for critical speech have been reported in both areas. The cybercrime law issued by the HoR in 2022 allows the authorities to engage in surveillance of private communications without clear guidelines or safeguards against abuse.",1

lithuania,"The government generally respects freedom of the press, and the media market is vibrant. However, the increasing concentration of media ownership in the hands of a small number of companies raises the risk of editorial interference by powerful political and business interests. Journalists often engage in self-censorship when reporting on certain large companies. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic left the media more vulnerable to undue influence and affected the job security of journalists. Journalists also face online harassment and abuse.Under the state of emergency declared after Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the transmission of any programs broadcast by Russian and Belarusian television and radio channels was suspended. The state of emergency also allowed for the restriction of Lithuanian media if they were deemed to spread disinformation or propaganda, incite war, or breach Lithuanian sovereignty.

malaysia,"Prior to the 2018 elections, most private news publications and television stations were controlled by political parties or businesses allied with the BN, and state news outlets similarly reflected government views. The market liberalized after the PH took power that year, as independent outlets benefited from a reduction in political pressure and harassment. The subsequent PN government placed more pressure on the media, excluding independent outlets from events of public interest. Despite some efforts at reform, a number of restrictive media laws remain in place, including civil and criminal defamation statutes. The amended 1950 Evidence Act holds owners and editors of websites, providers of web-hosting services, and owners of computers or mobile devices accountable for information published through their services or property, exposing them to punitive fines and encouraging self-censorship.In September 2022, authorities filed criminal defamation charges against journalists with The Edge media group for a report on market manipulation.

Reporting on the situation in the north remains dangerous due to the presence of active militant groups. Defamation is a crime that can draw fines or prison time. In February 2022, the transitional government suspended the accreditation process for journalists. Later that month, Benjamin Roger, a French journalist working for Jeune Afrique, was arrested soon after arriving in Mali and was forced to return to France after authorities confiscated his visa, saying that he did not have the required press accreditation. The government suspended French broadcasters Radio France Internationale (RFI) and France 24 in March after the outlets reported on alleged abuses by Malian security forces; the suspensions were confirmed to be “definitive” in April. Domestic outlet Joliba TV News received a two-month suspension in November after it criticized the military-led government. Journalist Malick Konaté reported being threatened by both state and nonstate actors in November after he contributed to reporting on the Wagner Group’s presence in Mali.During 2021, transitional authorities began to seek justice for past instances of violence against members of the media. That July, transitional authorities arrested General Moussa Diawara, former head of the General Directorate of State Security (DGSE), and issued an international arrest warrant for Karim Keïta, son of the former president, in connection with the 2016 disappearance of journalist Birama Touré.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has recorded at least nine journalists killed in Mexico every year since 2016.Self-censorship has increased, with many newspapers in violent areas avoiding publishing stories concerning organized crime. Despite several convictions in prominent cases of murdered journalists in recent years, approximately 90 percent of cases of journalists who are killed are unresolved. The Federal Protection Mechanism for Human Rights Defenders and Journalists within the Interior Secretariat has successfully protected hundreds of activists and reporters, providing them safe houses, panic buttons, and bodyguards. However, the mechanism is underfunded and has not always proved effective: at least two of the journalists killed in 2022 were receiving official protection.Diversity of viewpoints in print and online media remains high, but broadcast television has long been dominated by the duopoly of Televisa and TV Azteca. Media outlets depend on government advertising and subsidies. Congress enacted legislation to regulate the distribution of state publicity in 2018; such advertising subsequently diminished significantly, but distribution remains heavily skewed toward a few of the largest outlets.

In July 2022, for example, Jurnal TV founder Val Butnaru was fined and barred from holding leadership posts at television or radio outlets for six months after he was found guilty of slander. Butnaru was accused of the offense by the Buiucani Police Inspectorate in 2021 after he reported on police officers’ involvement in a smuggling operation.Concerns over the independence of the Audiovisual Council (CA), Moldova’s media regulator, have surfaced in recent years. Parliament amended the audiovisual-services code in 2021, making it easier to dismiss CA members. In a 2021 report, the OSCE noted that the amended code increased parliamentary control over the CA and the public broadcaster, TeleRadio-Moldova. Moldovan authorities restricted access to Russian media after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. In June, President Sandu promulgated the Informational Security Law, which banned Russian television news programming from being broadcast in Moldova. Under the law, 50 percent of television content must be sourced from European Union member states, the United States, and countries that ratified the European Convention on Transfrontier Television.The Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) used emergency powers to block two websites later in 2022, stating that the websites spread false information and incited hatred with their content. In December, the CSE suspended the licenses of six television stations after the CA said they offered inaccurate information on the war. All six are owned by or otherwise tied to Ilan Șor.",2,"While the constitution guarantees religious freedom and separation of the state from religion, the law also provides special status to the Moldovan Orthodox Church. Orthodox symbols have been placed in public institutions, and Orthodox churches are sometimes present within public hospitals and some schools.",3,"Academic freedom is generally respected. However, the Orthodox Church has strong influence over the educational system, with education officials at all levels frequently promoting the church and Orthodox beliefs.In July 2022, the government announced plans to merge higher-education institutions, which it said would improve their standards and competitiveness. Staff and students at institutions that would be merged criticized the proposal, saying it was not transparently discussed with them.",3,"Individuals are generally able to engage in discussions of a political nature without fear of retribution. In November 2022, legislators introduced a bill that would allow the SIS to intercept mail and phone communications and engage in surveillance outside of a criminal investigation.",4

mongolia,"Press freedom is generally respected, and media outlets collectively present a wide range of views. However, coverage can be partisan; the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted in its 2021 election observation mission report that many media outlets are dependent on the finances of their politically connected owners, who attempt to exert editorial control. Ownership of media companies remains opaque. Many journalists self-censor to avoid offending political or business interests and facing costly libel or defamation suits.Authorities imposed criminal penalties for the dissemination of purported disinformation in March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold worldwide. Journalists reportedly engaged in self-censorship while reporting on the pandemic.

Evidence of actual retaliation by powerful actors, who appear to be able to mobilize police to punish dissidents, remains scant.",3
montenegro,"A variety of independent media operate in Montenegro, and media coverage is partisan and combative on certain issues. Unlike the DPS government, the Krivokapić government did not seek to pressure reporters. Abazović, on the other hand, brough back some of the DPS’s fiery rhetoric targeting critical journalists.The state broadcaster, Radio and Television of Montenegro (RTCG), has made strides in transforming into a genuine public-service broadcaster, and features a more balanced editorial policy and more inclusive and diverse political content. Public opinion polls in 2022 showed increased public trust in RTCG, as well increased viewership.The lack of external pressure during 2021 and 2022 made internal censorship within media houses and self-censorship among journalists less prominent. Reporters who cover corruption and organized crime still risk violence.",3,"The constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief. However, during the final years of the DPS government, the SPC and its adherents were subject to discrimination and hate speech, and its clergy has been characterized by the DPS as enemies of the state.",3,"Academic freedom is guaranteed by law and generally upheld. However, political controversies in past years have affected the ability of the rector of the University of Montenegro to operate independently.",3,"People are generally free to engage in public discussions.

Individuals’ fear of retribution for expressing their opinions online has diminished, and open criticism of the parliamentary majority and the government has become more commonplace.",3
morocco,"The state dominates the broadcast media, but affluent Moroccans have access to foreign satellite television channels. Although the independent press enjoys a significant degree of freedom when reporting on economic and social policies, the authorities use a number of financial, legal, and social mechanisms to punish critical journalists who focus on the king, his family, the status of Western Sahara, or political Islam. The authorities also occasionally disrupt websites and internet platforms. According to a September 2022 report by international media rights group Global Voices, Moroccan authorities have used Pegasus mobile phone spyware to surveil journalists in Morocco.Since 2018, several independent journalists have faced prosecution on dubious charges of sexual assault or financial misconduct. In one notable case in 2021, Akhbar al-Youm editor in chief Soulaimane Raissouni was sentenced to five years in prison on sexual assault charges that the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and other rights groups described as fraudulent.",1,"Nearly all Moroccans are Muslims, and the king, identified as “commander of the faithful” in the constitution, has ultimate authority over religious affairs. Imams are required to obtain state certification, and mosques are monitored by the authorities. The government operates a well-financed training program for imams and female religious counselors tasked with promoting a state-sanctioned version of “moderate Islam,” which some critics charge is also intended to promote political quiescence. Despite deep societal prejudices, a 3,000-person Jewish community is permitted to practice its faith, though many synagogues are unmarked. The Christian community, which numbers approximately 50,000, also experiences prejudice. Christian marriages are not legally recognized by the government.",2,"Universities provide a relatively open space for discussion, but professors practice self-censorship when dealing with sensitive topics. Salafists—adherents of a fundamentalist form of Islam—are closely monitored in universities. Periodic violence between university student groups, often stoked by Morocco’s political, ethnic, and sectarian differences, inhibits the right to peaceful student activism.",2,"State surveillance of online activity and personal communications is a serious concern, and the arrests of journalists, bloggers, and activists for critical speech serve as a deterrent to uninhibited debate among the broader population. The use of spyware and surveillance technologies by the government is widespread. In July 2022, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report detailing how Moroccan authorities have developed an “ecosystem of repression” to silence dissidents and potential critics. Pro-Makhzen media outlets frequently deploy digital smear campaigns to intimidate government critics and activists, flooding the internet with content that reveals dissidents’ intimate and private information.",2
mozambique,"State-run outlets dominate the Mozambican media sector, and authorities often direct such outlets to provide coverage favorable to the government. However, several smaller independent outlets provide important coverage. Journalists frequently experience government pressure, harassment, and intimidation, which encourages self-censorship.The government is known to retaliate against critical journalists, including by canceling public advertising contracts. Journalists and political commentators appearing on television programs have been the targets of attacks and kidnappings in recent years. Police frequently harass, assault, and detain journalists. In August 2022, reporters Alexandre Eusébio and Ivaldo Novela were assaulted by five National Criminal Investigation Service (SERNIC) officers while reporting on a police officer’s funeral in Maputo. The officers injured the journalists and broke their equipment; the journalists reportedly pressed charges against the officers involved.Several journalists have reportedly been forcibly disappeared in recent years. In 2021, Cassien Ntamuhanga, a Rwandan journalist and activist who had sought asylum in Mozambique, was arrested by SERNIC agents; his whereabouts remain unknown.In May 2022, parliament passed a bill to amend Mozambique’s antiterror law, sending it to President Nyusi in June. Among other things, the bill contains provisions penalizing those who “publicly reproduce false statements regarding terrorist acts” with up to eight years in prison. Press freedom advocates have expressed concern that the proposed amendment could effectively criminalize reporting on the insurgency in the north of the country. The amendment was ultimately adopted by the government in June.",2,"Religious freedom is generally respected, but government responses to attacks by armed Islamists have involved closing mosques and detaining Muslim leaders, alarming human rights activists. Catholic churches have been targeted by terrorist attacks in recent years.

myanmar,"Following the coup, the military seized control of state-owned broadcast media, took private broadcasters off the air, and severely restricted internet access, including access to social media platforms and news outlets. Licenses for several independent media organizations were rescinded in March 2021. However, several independent media outlets continued to provide news coverage, operating in hiding and in exile.

Since the February 2021 coup, dozens of journalists have been forced to flee following the military’s crackdown on press freedoms, and most independent outlets now operate underground or from exile. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 42 journalists were behind bars in Myanmar as of December 2022, the third-highest number of imprisoned journalists in the world, after Iran and China. Several journalists have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms, including Japanese journalist Toru Kubota, who was released in November 2022 following intervention from Japanese officials.",1,"The constitution provides for freedom of religion. It distinguishes Buddhism as the majority religion, but also recognizes Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and animism. The government occasionally interferes with religious assemblies and attempts to control the Buddhist clergy. Authorities discriminate against minority religious groups—particularly Muslims—in practice, refusing them permission to hold gatherings and restricting educational activities, proselytization, and construction and repair of houses of worship.

Muslims face systematic discrimination in obtaining identity cards, and “Muslim-free” villages have been established with the complicity of the authorities, who have at times amplified hate speech. The officially illegal Buddha Dhamma Parahita Foundation, formerly known as Ma Ba Tha, urges boycotts against Muslim-run businesses and disseminates anti-Muslim propaganda.",1,"Political activity on university campuses is restricted, and universities are not autonomous. Student unions—which have historically been important advocates for human rights—are discouraged, have no formal registration mechanisms, and are viewed with suspicion by authorities.

University students and staff played a key role in antimilitary protests and strikes following the February 2021 coup; in response, the military stormed dozens of universities, seizing control of the campuses and detaining or suspending thousands of students and faculty members. Arrests of students and teachers continued in 2022; by July, at least 24 teachers had been killed and more than 200 detained since the start of the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). The NUG estimated that approximately 200,000 out of a total of 450,000 teachers had joined the CDM at some point following the coup. While some returned to work in regime-administered schools out of necessity, others have turned to teaching children in areas outside of the junta’s control, where a robust network of CDM schools has been set up.",0,"Private discussion and personal expression—already constrained by state surveillance and laws inhibiting online speech—became more difficult following the 2021 coup. Upon taking power, the regime enacted sweeping revisions of existing legal code, removing several key human rights protections against arbitrary surveillance and banning online circumvention tools to evade surveillance.

The regime’s legal reforms also severely curtailed freedom of expression. Hundreds of people were arrested and prosecuted under the revised legal code, usually for comments made online; hundreds of others have been forced into hiding or exile to avoid arrest; and many have been killed in protests, targeted by attack, or killed by military execution. In July 2022 the regime executed four pro-democracy activists, including writer-activist Ko Jimmy and singer and former lawmaker Phyo Zeyar Thaw, after convicting them in a sham trial by military tribunal. Capital punishment had not been used in decades.",1
namibia,"The constitution guarantees media freedom and freedom of expression. In practice, journalists face few legal restrictions and generally work without risking their personal safety. The judiciary has been credited with protecting media freedoms, and in July 2022, the Namibian Supreme Court overturned a defamation ruling against Namibia Media Holdings. The company and one of its former editors had been ordered to pay damages and the cost of the suit to a game farmer and his company over a 2017 news article that claimed elephants at his farm were kept in “deplorable” conditions.In May police fired rubber bullets at several journalists who were covering a protest at China Town in Windhoek. Earlier, in February, two freelance investigative reporters were briefly detained for allegedly trespassing at a private farm while investigating the alleged illegal sale of pregnant wild elephants, purchased at a controversial government auction, to unidentified groups in Dubai.While self-censorship is common in state media, private media remain critical of the government. Journalists faced impediments during the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, the labor minister, Utoni Nujoma, filed a defamation suit against the owners of the weekly Windhoek Observer and its editor over a 2019 article alleging he had extorted money from a farmer in 2017 and 2018.

The lack of legislative responses to communication technology-facilitated abuse leaves victims of misogynistic online abuse—in particular prominent women, journalists, girls, the LGBT+ community, and other minority groups—without adequate legal recourse. The government reportedly maintains significant capabilities to conduct surveillance on citizens, which may discourage people from expressing dissent. In March 2021, the government published new regulations of the 2009 Communications Act that would enable interception of telecommunications by national intelligence and the police. Defamation laws may also discourage free speech. In February 2022, Namibia’s first lady won 250,000 Namibian dollars (US$15,300) in a defamation suit against an opposition party figure, Abed Hishoono, who was accused of spreading false and defamatory content about her. She later issued a statement in June saying she forgave him and would not seek compensation after he showed remorse.

nicaragua,"The Ortega regime has cracked down on free and independent media and journalists since returning to power in 2007. The government has intimidated and arrested journalists, censored media outlets, and sought to deprive print media of essential supplies, including ink and paper. The regime has also targeted foreign outlets, preventing New York Times reporters from entering the country in 2021. In September 2022, the Confidencial news outlet reported that 54 outlets have been shuttered, 8 media workers have been imprisoned, and 140 journalists have sought exile since 2007.The government’s attacks against the free press continued in 2022. In August, the government formally confiscated the building housing La Prensa.

The Ortega regime continued to target academic freedom in 2022. In January, the government ended the legal status of three university associations, saying they operated outside of the law. In February, it ordered the closure of 7 universities; a total of 14 were sshuttered between December 2021 and February 2022. In March 2022, the National Assembly approved a law that makes the government-controlled National Council of Universities a main governing body in academia, limiting academic autonomy.

Domestic third-generation (3G) mobile service, available since 2008, may serve at least 6.5 million subscribers. Ordinary mobile users can connect to a state-run intranet but not the global internet. Mobile phones operating on this network function as state surveillance tools, which can review individuals’ application usage and browsing history and take screenshots of activity. Newer mobile phones include measures to prevent the consumption of contraband media, with some resorting to hacking to circumvent them. Only a few elites have internet access, reaching it through their own service. Domestic and international mobile services are kept strictly separate. Individuals using Chinese-origin phones have faced crackdowns, while officials sent to China must install surveillance software on their devices.",0

Media outlets were reportedly told to avoid reporting on demonstrations that were held in several cities in 2021.The government has broad authority to close outlets, block websites, revoke licenses, and prosecute journalists for content violations, and it has used this authority on multiple occasions in recent years. The government’s efforts to suppress critical news and commentary regularly include arrests and prosecutions of prominent individuals who are active on social media.",1,"Islam is the state religion. Non-Muslims have the right to worship, but they are banned from proselytizing. Religious organizations must register with the government.

pakistan,"Pakistan has boasted a relatively vibrant media sector, with many television news channels and print publications presenting a range of news and opinions. However, both the civilian authorities and military have curtailed media freedom in recent years, and the PTI government that took power in 2018 accelerated this trend. Media outlets have faced interference with distribution and broadcast, withdrawal of government advertising, a ban on specific television presenters, physical attack, and the temporary disappearance of journalists.The media sector faces similar dangers under the current Sharif government. In August 2022, media regulators took the ARY News television channel off the air after a PTI official made comments critical of the military on a broadcast. The official was arrested and charged with sedition and abetting mutiny. In October, gunmen shot and killed ARY News anchor Arshad Sharif in Kenya in an apparently targeted attack. Sharif fled to Kenya after receiving death threats.The military prohibits access to militancy- and insurgency-affected areas, impeding coverage of issues there.

Under a Punjab government directive issued in July 2022, Muslim couples wanting to register their marriage must declare their belief in the finality of Mohammad’s prophethood. In August 2022, an Ahmadi man in the town of Rabwah was stabbed to death in a hate crime.",1,"Pakistani authorities have long used the education system to portray Hindus and other non-Muslims negatively and to rationalize enmity between Pakistan and India, among other ideological aims. Past attempts to modernize education and introduce religious tolerance into school textbooks have made little progress, and minority groups consider negative portrayals of non-Muslims in textbooks as a continuing source of hostility towards them. In July 2022, the education minister announced the renaming of the national curriculum launched by the PTI government and pledged to use it as a vehicle to set educational standards and counter violent extremism.In recent years, scholars have been somewhat more able to discuss sensitive issues involving the military. However, there is no academic freedom on matters pertaining to religion, where academics remain vulnerable to blasphemy accusations.",2,"Pakistanis are free in practice to discuss many topics, but the 2016 Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act gives the executive-controlled Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) unchecked powers to censor material online. The PTA encourages reporting of websites complainants consider offensive. The PTA’s broad and poorly defined censorship mandate includes preventing both morally objectionable content and the maligning of the “state, judiciary, or armed forces.” In practice, it censors content arbitrarily.Direct or implied criticism of the army remains taboo and individuals could be punished for airing such views.The threat of being accused of blasphemy and facing draconian legal action, murder, or mob attacks also deters unfettered speech. In January 2022, a Rawalpindi court sentenced a woman to death over messages she allegedly sent via WhatsApp and Facebook, after a complainant called the messages blasphemous.",2

Such cases are often filed against journalists and media outlets. Independent, critical journalists and outlets reportedly face editorial pressure from the government, and some journalists have experienced harassment when covering stories and opinions unfavorable to the government. In September 2021, journalist Mauricio Valenzuela was charged with gender-based violence (GBV) for allegedly harassing sitting parliamentarian Zulay Rodríguez. Valenzuela, who had recently contributed to a series of investigative reports implicating Rodríguez in various crimes, denied the accusation; his employer, digital media outlet Foco Panama, accused the government of using the judicial system to target critical media outlets.

In 2020, PKN Orlen, an oil firm in which Warsaw maintains a significant stake, bought Polska Press, which operates a large number of regional newspapers and online portals. While PKN Orlen pledged to safeguard editorial independence, all but one of the chief editors at Polska Press’s daily newspapers was replaced by May 2022.Since 2015, state-controlled companies have shifted their advertising to private outlets that support PiS.

romania,"Although the media environment is relatively free and pluralistic, key outlets remain controlled by businesspeople with political interests, and their coverage is highly distorted by their owners’ priorities. Media outlets increasingly rely on publicly funded advertising and subsidies, jeopardizing the outlets’ independence.There are rising threats and intimidation from state institutions against some journalists. For example, in January 2022, the home of Alin Cristea, the editor in chief of an online news outlet, was raided by officers from the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT). The officers said they were investigating the alleged possession or distribution of child sexual abuse images based on material published by the journalist about a case of brutality against a minor that had been captured on video. Free speech advocates expressed concern that the raid was a form of retaliation connected to Cristea’s critical reporting about law enforcement. In November 2022, a court ruled that the case brought by DIICOT against Cristea was unjustified.In April, a journalist involved in revealing cases of plagiarism in the doctoral theses of prominent politicians said that she was being harassed, intimidated, and threatened by unknown people as a result of her reporting, which led to the September 2022 resignation of the minister of education.",3,"Religious freedom is generally respected.

russia,"Although the constitution provides for freedom of speech, vague laws on extremism grant the authorities great discretion to crack down on any speech, organization, or activity that lacks official support. The government controls, directly or through state-owned companies and friendly business magnates, all national television networks and many radio and print outlets, as well as most of the media advertising market. Laws on extremism, foreign agents, and undesirable organizations have been used to harass media outlets, curtailing their access to funding and forcing many to cease operations in Russia. In 2020, the foreign agents law was expanded to apply to individuals and informal organizations. Under a measure passed by the Duma in June 2022 and enforced beginning in December, anyone “under foreign influence” or who received any type of foreign support is considered a foreign agent. Under that measure, Roskomnadzor, the federal media and telecommunications agency, can block websites classified as foreign agents at the Justice Ministry’s request.As the war against Ukraine began, Roskomnadzor instructed outlets to only use Defense Ministry updates and to refrain from using words like “war” or “invasion” when discussing it. The government also began restricting access to a wide variety of websites, including those of domestic and foreign news outlets. Echo of Moscow, one of Russia’s few remaining independent media outlets, closed that month after Roskomnadzor accused it of sharing “deliberately false” news. Later that month, after receiving a warning from Roskomnadzor, Novaya Gazeta said it would suspend its operations. In September, the newspaper’s media license was stripped. By November, the websites of 175 domestic outlets and hundreds of foreign-based outlets were blocked.A series of laws require social networks to remove “illegal” content, fine websites that fail to block such content, and enforce prison sentences for online “libel,” among other provisions. In March 2022, Roskomnadzor blocked access to Facebook, saying it discriminated against Russian media. Instagram was also blocked that month, after authorities said it hosted extremist content. Under criminal-code revisions passed in March, the dissemination of “false news” about the Russian military can be punished with prison terms as long as 15 years.",0,"Freedom of religion is upheld unevenly. A 1997 law on religion gives the state extensive control and makes it difficult for new or independent groups to operate. The Russian Orthodox Church has a privileged position, working closely with the government on foreign and domestic policy priorities. Antiterrorism legislation approved in 2016 grants authorities the power to suppress religious groups that are deemed extremist. The Jehovah’s Witnesses were declared an extremist organization in 2017, leading to a protracted campaign against worshippers marked by surveillance, property seizures, arrests, and torture. Over 600 Jehovah’s Witnesses have since been charged with or convicted of extremism as of September 2022. In June, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) declared the ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses unlawful and ordered Russia to pay reparations, discontinue criminal proceedings, release imprisoned individuals, and return confiscated property. That same month, the Duma voted to end the ECtHR’s jurisdiction over Russia retroactively to March.

Educators and academics must also receive permission from authorities for public “educational activities.”Russian authorities have further manipulated the country’s education system after the war against Ukraine began. Schools and teachers have been ordered to hold “patriotic education” classes, use state-sanctioned language to describe the invasion, and openly defend the war in their classrooms. Educators who did not comply or expressed opposition to the war were fined or dismissed. Students who withdraw from a related class reportedly risk punishment. In November, the Education Ministry announced that Soviet-era compulsory military training would be introduced in high schools in 2023. Under legislative measures that took effect in December 2022, so-called foreign agents were banned from teaching in public schools.After the invasion of Ukraine, the government forbade scientists from attending international conferences. In March 2022, it declared a science newspaper, Troitsky Variant, a foreign agent after it published a letter opposing the war.

The penal code revisions passed in 2018 criminalized cartoons and writings that “humiliate” Rwandan leaders, but also decriminalized defamation, which the Rwanda Journalists Association considered an improvement to the highly restrictive legal framework. Many Rwandan journalists have fled the country and work in exile. Due in part to this phenomenon, the government has increasingly blocked access to news services and websites based abroad. In June 2022, several foreign correspondents were reportedly denied accreditation or otherwise obstructed from freely covering the Commonwealth summit hosted by Rwanda that month.Authorities continued to target journalists and bloggers—particularly those broadcasting via the online video platform YouTube—for intimidation, arrest, or prosecution during 2022, using a broad interpretation of media laws that allow them to restrict content that is deemed offensive, false, or contrary to public safety and public morals. While three journalists with the YouTube-based outlet Iwacu TV were acquitted of several charges and released in October 2022, they had already spent four years in detention.

Public and private universities generally lack any robust political debate.Since 2008 the government has increasingly mandated the use of English as the language of instruction, including in primary schools as of 2019.

In addition to electronic surveillance, the authorities reportedly use informants to infiltrate civil society, further discouraging citizens from voicing dissent. Individuals have been forcibly disappeared, arrested, detained, and assassinated for expressing their views.Innocent Bahati, a popular poet who had shared his critical social commentary on social media, remained missing during 2022 following his 2021 disappearance; he had been arbitrarily detained by police in the past. Among other prominent cases, the trial of Aimable Karasira, a former university lecturer and YouTube commentator who was arrested in 2021 for alleged genocide denial and divisionism, was ongoing at year’s end, and he reported being tortured and denied medical treatment in custody.",0

samoa,"Several public and privately owned print and broadcast news outlets operate in Samoa, and internet access has expanded rapidly in recent years. While press freedom is generally respected, politicians and other powerful actors have used libel or defamation suits to respond to critical remarks or stories about them. In 2017, the parliament passed legislation that reintroduced criminal libel. Artistic works are also subject to government restrictions; in 2019, the feature film Rocketman was banned for depicting same-sex sexual activity, which is illegal in Samoa. During the 2021 general elections campaign, journalists were banned from attending some gatherings in villages or districts.In May 2022, Lagi Keresoma, the President of the Journalists Association of Western Samoa (JAWS), said that journalists face challenges because of “the belief that freedom of expression is not part of the Samoan culture,” especially in villages and districts.",3,"Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and mostly respected in practice. However, a 2017 constitutional amendment shifted references to Samoa being a Christian nation from the constitution’s preamble to its body text, meaning it can potentially be used in legal action. There is strong societal pressure at the village level—including from village councils—to participate in the activities of the main local church.In April and May 2020, the Samoan Law Society and the country’s ombudsman expressed concerns that provisions in three government-backed bills—the Constitution Amendment Bill 2020, the Lands and Titles Court Bill 2020, and the Judicature Amendment Bill 2020—could limit religious freedom by removing the Land and Titles Court from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, meaning the latter could no longer review decisions on village customary matters that violated individual rights.

saudi-arabia,"The government controls domestic media content and heavily influences regional print and satellite-television coverage. Journalists can be imprisoned for a variety of vaguely defined crimes. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that 11 journalists were imprisoned in Saudi Arabia as of December 2022.A 2011 royal decree amended the press law to criminalize, among other things, any criticism of the country’s grand mufti, the Council of Senior Religious Scholars, or government officials; violations can result in fines and forced closure of media outlets. All blogs and websites must have a Ministry of Information license or face fines and possible closure.Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent self-exiled Saudi journalist who was working for the Washington Post in the United States, was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018. Some of the perpetrators were sentenced to prison in Saudi Arabia, but no senior officials were held accountable despite evidence that the murder was coordinated by the then deputy head of the general intelligence presidency and by a senior adviser to the crown prince.The government maintains an extensive system of social media surveillance and regulation and invests considerable resources in automated “bot” and other accounts that influence and distort the social media environment and target prominent users. It also uses a vaguely worded and broad-ranging cybercrime law as a means of cracking down on the sharing of critical news and commentary online.In May 2022, the General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM) fined two female social media celebrities for violating a law against content that would harm the kingdom’s relations with friendly countries. The names of the influencers and of the country in question were not disclosed by the commission. In July, Saudi authorities requested that YouTube delete advertisements that they considered contradictory to Islamic values, and in September, the Saudi government joined its counterparts in the Gulf Cooperation Council to demand that Netflix remove video content related to LGBT+ people.",0,"The 1992 Basic Law declares that the Quran and the Sunna are the country’s constitution. Islam is the official religion, and all Saudis are required by law to be Muslims. A 2014 royal decree punishes atheism with up to 20 years in prison. The government prohibits the public observance of any religion other than Islam and restricts Shiite and Sufi Muslims’ religious practices. The construction of Shiite mosques is constrained through licensing rules and prohibited outside of Eastern Province, where most Shiites live. Although the government recognizes the right of non-Muslims to worship in private, it does not always respect this right in practice. In July 2022, a Saudi citizen was arrested for having helped a non-Muslim to illegally enter Mecca, Islam’s holiest city.The government exercises significant influence over Muslim clerics—both officially appointed figures who depend on government patronage and independent religious scholars who need a measure of official goodwill to function openly, appear on television, and avoid penalties.Online commentary that touches on religion can be harshly punished.",0,"Academic freedom is restricted, and informers monitor classrooms for compliance with curriculum rules, including a ban on teaching secular philosophy and religions other than Islam. Despite changes to textbooks in recent years, intolerance in the classroom remains a significant problem, as some educators continue to espouse discriminatory and hateful views of non-Muslims and Muslim minority sects.Academics and researchers have faced punishment for being perceived as criticizing government policies.",1,"Saudis can engage in some degree of private discussion on political and other topics, including criticism of certain aspects of government performance, but the climate for free expression has deteriorated sharply since the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi and the arrests of many prominent writers and activists, which served as warnings to ordinary Saudis to avoid dissent. Self-censorship is virtually ubiquitous.Surveillance is extensive within Saudi Arabia, and Saudis living and traveling abroad are also subject to spying and intimidation. The government is known to have purchased Pegasus spyware, which allows users to secretly hack into a target’s phone and spy on their whereabouts and communications in real time. Investigations in 2021 by foreign journalists and technology researchers uncovered a new form of surveillance tool used by the Saudi government that needed no interaction with the targeted user to access their personal devices. There are severe criminal penalties for criticism of the regime and free discussion on topics like religion or the royal family. Laws are often vaguely worded, giving the state considerable discretion to determine what constitutes illegal expression. In August 2022, two women received long prison sentences for using Twitter to share posts by dissidents or make remarks that were critical of the government: Salma al-Shehab, a doctoral student in Britain who was arrested while visiting her family in the kingdom, was sentenced to 34 years in prison and a 34-year travel ban. Nourah al-Qahtani was sentenced to 45 years in prison. Neither had a large online following or was known for political activism.In addition to criminal penalties, individuals can face dismissal from employment in reprisal for their online activity. In February 2022, two expatriate workers were fired in separate incidents after they posted content that was deemed offensive to the kingdom.",1
senegal,"The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, and Senegal is home to many independent television and radio stations and print outlets. Although the overall media situation has improved considerably since President Sall was first elected in 2012, several subsequent developments have constrained press freedom. Reporters Without Borders warned of an increasingly threatening press environment ahead of the 2022 legislative elections, citing several incidents including a June interview in which a ruling party youth leader called to “burn down” media company Walfadjri and “attack” its journalists. The youth leader, Talla Sylla, apologized for the remarks in July.A controversial law enacted in January 2021 allows for prison terms of up to two years for defamation and three years for publishing “fake news” likely to “discredit public institutions” or “prejudice public decency.” The law was applied multiple times in 2022 against journalists and activists. In one case, Pape Alé Niang, who runs the news website Dakarmatin, was arrested in November 2022 on charges of violating the false news law and publishing antistate information; the charges relate to Niang’s reporting about a leaked government report that allegedly exonerates Sonko of the rape charge against him. Niang was released on bail in mid-December before being rearrested days later for allegedly violating a bail condition. He remained in detention at year’s end.In an earlier arrest connected to the charges against Sonko, television journalist Pape Malick Thiam was arrested by gendarmes and reportedly beaten severely while covering court proceedings in April 2022. Thiam was allegedly filming in a restricted area and contested an officer’s decision to confiscate his phone. On March 31, 2022, the Audiovisual Regulatory Council (CNRA) suspended two opposition-affiliated television channels for three days for “breaches of ethics.” A year earlier, the CNRA had briefly suspended one of the same two stations and another station for their coverage of the March 2021 protests, saying that the coverage “could threaten national stability or social cohesion.” Also during the March 2021 protests, the government disrupted internet service and partially blocked major social media outlets such as WhatsApp and YouTube.",2,"There is no state religion, and freedom of worship is constitutionally protected and respected in practice.

In May 2022, President Sall expressed interest in expanding government oversight of social media.In June 2021, the National Assembly amended the penal code and the code of criminal procedure, allegedly to combat terrorism.

serbia,"Despite a constitution that guarantees freedom of the press and a penal code that does not treat libel as a criminal offense, media freedom is undermined by the threat of lawsuits or criminal charges against journalists for other offenses, lack of transparency in media ownership, editorial pressure from politicians and politically connected media owners, direct pressure and threats against journalists, and high rates of self-censorship. The incumbent political parties generally receive the majority of media coverage from public broadcasters. The REM has been criticized for a lack of independence, particularly when deciding on allocation of national broadcast frequencies. Reporters without Borders (RSF) characterized the media environment as “polluted by propaganda, influence peddling and fake news” after four national broadcast frequencies were awarded to progovernment media in July 2022. A potential fifth frequency had not been allocated as of year’s end, causing two TV channels that were denied a national frequency, N1 and Nova S, to temporarily go off-air in protest. The state and ruling party exercise influence over private media in part through advertising contracts and other indirect subsidies. Many private outlets are owned by SNS supporters. Some privately owned national broadcasters and popular tabloids regularly participate in smear campaigns against the political opposition and other perceived government opponents. The authorities regularly ignore or reject information requests, impeding the work of journalists.Independent investigative groups have been increasingly subjected to harassment, intimidation, and violence by authorities and progovernment groups. Several members of the ruling party have openly threatened journalists, and Vučić regularly and publicly disparages independent media outlets. Journalists have faced physical attacks, smear campaigns, online harassment, and punitive tax inspections. The Independent Journalists’ Association of Serbia counted 132 attacks directed at journalists during 2022.",2,"The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, which is generally respected in practice.",4,"Academic freedom has largely been upheld, though recent practice and legal changes have raised concerns about political influence.

A publicly owned broadcaster provides television and radio programming alongside a private television station and two private radio stations.

In the past, media workers practiced a degree of self-censorship to protect their advertising earnings and to avoid the application of strict—but rarely enforced—defamation laws.

singapore,"All domestic newspapers, radio stations, and television channels are owned by government-linked companies. Editorials and news coverage generally support state policies, and self-censorship is common, though newspapers occasionally publish critical content. The government uses racial or religious tensions and the threat of terrorism to justify restrictions on freedom of speech. Media outlets, bloggers, and public figures have been subjected to harsh civil and criminal penalties for speech deemed to be seditious, defamatory, or injurious to religious sensitivities. Major online news sites must obtain licenses and respond to regulators’ requests to remove prohibited content. However, foreign media and a growing array of online domestic outlets—including news sites and blogs—are widely consumed and offer alternative views.The last prominent independent media outlet, The Online Citizen, was forced to close in September 2021 after the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the country’s media regulator, canceled the site’s license over its alleged failure to report on its funding sources. In September 2022, The Online Citizen chief editor Terry Xu relocated to Taiwan and reactivated the outlet’s website and social media accounts, providing commentary and analysis of events throughout Asia without daily news coverage.  Members of independent media face threats of legal lawsuits and criminal charges. For example, Xu was sentenced to three weeks in jail on defamation charges in April 2022 for publishing a 2018 letter by Daniel De Costa Augustin on his site that alleged corruption among government ministers. De Costa was also sentenced to three months in jail for defamation and breaking computer crime law by using another person’s email account without their consent.",1,"The constitution guarantees freedom of religion if its practice does not violate any other regulations, and most groups worship freely.

In late December 2021, the Janša government secured a majority on the RTV SLO Programming Council through a tranche of appointments, despite opposition concerns over their legality. In March 2022, RTV SLO director general Andrej Grah Whatmough, a Janša appointee, named Jadranka Rebernik editor in chief of the flagship news program at TV Slovenia, RTV SLO’s television arm, over near-unanimous staff objections. In a video that surfaced in May, Slavko Kmetič, a member of the RTV SLO Programming Council and an SDS activist, was recorded discussing purges of journalists deemed critical of the party. In July, Uroš Urbanija, who led the Government Communication Office under Janša and had voiced hostility towards public media, was named director of TV Slovenia. In September, a group of RTV SLO employees said that managers were applying partisan pressure on them, including through disciplinary action.After taking office, the Golob government introduced a bill that would replace RTV SLO’s two governing boards with a single supervisory board.

On August 3, 2022, the government announced that it would be taking more direct control over the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC). Staff at SIBC reported that the policy change required a government representative to vet all news programs before broadcast to protect citizens from “lies and misinformation.” Five days later, the government claimed that no censors were vetting stories, though they had pushed SIBC editorial decision-makers to “balance” their stories. The prime minister’s office defended the move on the grounds that the SIBC is a state-owned entity and thus should be managed by the state.Later in August, the government threatened to ban foreign journalists following an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) investigative documentary into the Solomon Islands relationship with the Chinese government.

In September 2022, the Constitutional Court began reviewing the constitutionality of Articles 2 and 7 of the NSL, which define and punish “anti-state” organizations and proscribe the production or possession of material considered rebellious.

spain,"Spain has a free press that covers a wide range of perspectives and actively investigates high-level corruption. However, consolidation of private ownership poses a threat to media independence, and ownership in the print and online media sectors is less transparent than in broadcast media. In recent years, the media have become more polarized and increasingly replace factual reporting with opinion and commentary, a trend that fuels public mistrust of journalists.In 2021, after a years-long process, a new board of directors was elected to govern the public broadcaster, the Spanish Radio and Television Corporation (RTVE). The changes were intended to strengthen RTVE’s independence, but several information rights organizations argued that most of the board members were chosen based on political agreements between the government and opposition rather than on merit. In September 2022, the president of RTVE resigned after his performance faced criticism from both staff and the board. Media outlets have encountered a proliferation of lawsuits intended to obstruct their coverage of private-sector wrongdoing, and journalists are sometimes subject to harassment and physical assaults in the course of their work, especially during protests. The level of violence against journalists has fallen considerably in comparison with previous years, but continued harassment of journalists by far-right elements on social media has been widely reported. A controversial public safety law that took effect in 2015, nicknamed the “gag law” by its critics, established large fines for offenses including spreading images that could endanger police officers or protected facilities. Journalists have faced penalties for alleged violations of the law while reporting on police actions.",3,"Religious freedom is guaranteed in the constitution and respected in practice. As the country’s dominant religion, Roman Catholicism enjoys benefits not afforded to others, such as financing through the tax system. However, the religious organizations of Jews, Muslims, and Protestants also have certain privileges through agreements with the state, including tax exemptions and permission to station chaplains in hospitals and other institutions.

Individuals have also been prosecuted for insulting the monarchy, the flag, and other state institutions.",3
sri-lanka,"Freedom of the press is constitutionally guaranteed, though news outlets and civil society were cautious in challenging the government during the Rajapaksas’ time in power; media had largely muted coverage of corruption issues, for example.

In May 2022, a former detective who investigated the 2009 killing of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge testified that Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was defense minister at the time, may have been involved in Wickrematunge’s murder. Rajapaksa denied the allegations.

Media were more critical when reporting on the 2022 antigovernment protests, and journalists faced arrest and physical assault while covering them. In March, police and security forces arrested journalists who covered a protest near Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s home. On July 9, paramilitary forces attacked a team of reporters near then prime minister Wickremesinghe’s home; the officer who ordered the attack was suspended. Later that month, security forces assaulted journalists who were covering a raid on a Colombo protest site.",2,"While anti-Muslim riots have taken place in the past, relatively little interreligious conflict was reported in 2022.

Awareness of state officials’ harassment of civil society activists working on human rights issues in the north and east has deterred open discussion of such subjects among ordinary citizens. Antigovernment protesters active in 2022 reportedly avoided those issues and discouraged discourse on those subjects.

Sri Lankan authorities targeted internet users who discussed other matters in 2022. In April, an activist who administered a Facebook group called “Go Home Gota” was arrested and detained by police.

sudan,"The interim constitution guarantees freedom of the press, and the transitional government pledged to draft legislation that increases protections for journalists. In August 2021, the Ministry of Culture and Information published draft media reform laws for public consultations. The draft laws address the creation of a commission to support and protect the right to information; the independence of journalists and media organizations; the establishment of a Press Council to protect press freedom and oversee professionalism; and the creation of a Board of Governors of the Radio and Television Corporation. The laws were not approved prior to the October 2021 coup and their future remained unclear at the end of 2022.

Following the October 2021 coup, the Sudanese Journalists Association reported that coup leaders arrested journalists, shut down radio news outlets’ broadcasting stations, and harassed editors, pressuring them to abstain from critical reporting. Arrests of journalists were particularly violent in 2022 after General al-Burhan imposed a state of emergency at the end of 2021.

In 2019, transitional authorities moved to disband NCP groups in higher education and dismissed 28 university chancellors and 35 vice chancellors, many of whom were affiliated with the NCP. The administrators were replaced with more independent figures.",1,"The interim constitution affirmed the right to freedom of expression and privacy, including citizens’ right to engage in private correspondence without interference. The transitional government began to dismantle the surveillance apparatus associated with the former regime, notably by replacing the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) with the General Intelligence Service (GIS)—which has more restricted powers and responsibilities—in 2019. The transitional government increased penalties for disseminating false information and other such offenses in July 2020, and officials have arrested and harassed activists for critical speech. In March 2021, activist Waad Bahjat was sentenced to a six-month suspended prison sentence and fined 10,000 Sudanese pounds ($22) after being found guilty of “public annoyance” and “use of criminal force.” She had been arrested in 2020 after she livestreamed video on her Facebook page documenting women being harassed by police and SAF soldiers. She was initially charged with defamation, insult to a public servant exercising judicial proceedings, publishing false news, and public nuisance under the Sudanese Criminal Act of 1991, though some of these charges were dropped.

After the October 2021 coup, General al-Burhan issued a December decree expanding security forces’ and intelligence agencies’ powers to conduct home raids, surveil citizens, and detain suspects. Neighborhood resistance committees and human rights groups have claimed that the decree violates citizens’ rights to privacy and due process.",1

syria,"The constitution nominally guarantees freedom of the press, but in practice the media are heavily restricted in government-held areas, and journalists who report critically about the state are subject to censorship, detention, torture, and death in custody. All media must obtain permission to operate from the Interior Ministry. Private media in government-controlled territory are generally owned by figures associated with the regime.

Media freedom varies in territory held by other groups, but local outlets are typically under heavy pressure to support the dominant militant faction in their area. In February 2022, the PYD-led de facto authorities in northeastern Syria suspended the license of the Rudaw media group, an outlet based in Iraqi Kurdistan, and accused it of misinformation and incitement. In mid-March, the same authorities began requiring journalists to join the Union of Free Media, which is under the influence of the local administration. HTS regularly harasses perceived critics in its area, including journalists.

Journalists face physical danger throughout Syria, especially from regime forces and extremist groups. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 142 journalists and media workers were killed in connection with their work between 2011 and 2022. Another five were imprisoned and eight were missing as of December 2022.",0,"While the constitution mandates that the president be a Muslim, there is no state religion, and the regime has generally allowed different confessional groups to practice their faiths as long as their religious activities are not deemed politically subversive. The government monitors mosques and controls the appointment of Muslim religious leaders. Jehovah’s Witnesses are banned, proselytizing is restricted, and conversion of Muslims to other faiths is prohibited. The dominance of extremist groups in opposition-held areas of western Syria has threatened freedom of worship for local residents and displaced people. IS, which remains active as a terrorist and guerrilla force, persecutes religious activity that does not conform to its version of Sunni Islam.",2,"Academic freedom is severely restricted. University professors in government-held areas have been dismissed or imprisoned for expressing dissent, and some have been killed for supporting regime opponents.

taiwan,"The news media are generally free, reflecting a diversity of views and reporting aggressively on government policies, though many outlets display strong party affiliation in their coverage.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exerts significant influence on the Taiwanese media environment and maintains a well-funded, large-scale disinformation campaign. Pro-China companies and businessmen with significant interests in China, namely the Want Want China Times Media Group and owner Tsai Eng-meng, own media outlets that self-censor or otherwise avoid subjects Beijing deems sensitive, like human rights. The National Communications Commission (NCC) has at times blocked the expansion of such enterprises to ensure competition and pluralism and has fined television news channels for airing false reports. In 2020, the NCC rejected the broadcast license renewal of pro-Beijing CTi News. The NCC has also sought to regulate Chinese-owned over-the-top services. Under Taiwan’s libel laws, those who disseminate a fact that will “injure the reputation of another” can face criminal prosecution, with sentences of up to two years in prison or a fine.

However, the government faces the growing challenge of combating online disinformation—usually disseminated via social media from China or by pro-China actors in Taiwan—while upholding freedom of expression. Human rights experts have recommended improvements to laws meant to combat false information, which contain vague terms that have the potential to limit legitimate speech. Such laws are enforced against social media users, though cases rarely lead to convictions, and those found guilty are typically ordered to pay small fines.

tajikistan,"The government controls nearly all media outlets and broadcasting facilities. The state shuts out independent outlets and encourages self-censorship. Independent journalists face harassment and intimidation. Civil libel charges have been used to incapacitate outlets that criticize the government. Authorities routinely block critical websites, news portals, and social media platforms, while using periodic wholesale blackouts of internet and messaging services to suppress criticism.  In 2021, authorities ordered bloggers to register with tax authorities, a demand that observers noted stifled the few remaining independent voices. In October 2022, authorities brought extremism charges against two of the last remaining critical journalists and bloggers, Abdullo Gurbati and Daler Imomali. Gurtabi and Imomali were sentenced to 7.5 and 10 years in prison, respectively, after their reporting covered corruption, police brutality, and other social issues.",0,"The government imposes severe restrictions on religious freedom, in part by limiting religious activities to state-approved venues and registered organizations. Authorities continue to prosecute individuals for alleged membership in banned religious organizations, including Christian and Muslim groups. Minors are generally barred from attending religious services in mosques, as are women in most cases.Laws to discourage religious clothing (like the hijab) and an unofficial ban on beards are arbitrarily and sometimes violently enforced.

It also prescribes severe penalties, including prison terms, for publication of defamatory, seditious, or other illegal content.Sustained legal and regulatory pressure on journalists and other public figures has contributed to self-censorship and other suppression of news coverage. In a December 2021 report, the University of Dar es Salaam cited government pressure as a factor in the media sector’s pro-CCM bias during the 2020 elections. The government also threatened to arrest journalists who reported on Magufuli’s health.The Hassan administration’s record on media freedom is mixed. In April 2021, Hassan lifted a ban on some online media outlets. In February 2022, the government restored the licenses of Mawio, Mseto, Mwanahalisi, and Tanzania Daima, newspapers which had received bans or suspensions under Magufuli. There has been an increase in qualified criticism of the government in both English- and Swahili-language newspapers. However, self-censorship and progovernment bias remain prevalent.Authorities have also continued to target journalists under Hassan. The government suspended two newspapers for short periods in 2021 for publishing news deemed false.

Vague prohibitions on communication that “causes annoyance” or “leads to public disorder” have confused users as to what constitutes a violation and empowered authorities to suppress unfavorable speech at their discretion. The Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations 2020 prohibits “spreading rumors” or insulting the nation online.In August 2022, a government official was dismissed for criticizing a mobile money policy on social media.

tunisia,"The 2014 constitution and its 2022 replacement guarantee freedom of opinion, thought, expression, information, and publication, subject to some restrictions. During the 2011–21 period, independent outlets proliferated, including online. However, it remains difficult to obtain data about the ownership of media companies, their audiences, or the allocation of public advertising.Since Saïed’s seizure of extraordinary powers in 2021, journalists have faced increasing pressure and intimidation from government officials in connection with their work, including criminal penalties for defamation and other alleged offenses. In June 2022, for example, Salah Attia, editor of the independent news website Al-Ray al-Jadid, was arrested and questioned at a military facility in connection with his public statements; he was sentenced in August to three months in prison on charges including “harming the military’s morale and reputation.” In September, Ghassen Ben Khelifa, editor of the news website Inhiyez and a popular political writer, was arrested on unclear charges of promoting terrorism.",2,"Both the 2014 constitution and the new charter adopted in 2022 call for freedom of belief and conscience, but they also contain provisions that give Islam an official status. Blasphemy remains illegal, and police may invoke it as a pretext for arrests. Islamic education remains a required component of the curriculum in public schools. Converts to Christianity often experience harassment and discrimination.",3,"Article 33 of the 2014 constitution protected academic freedom, which improved in practice after 2011, and Article 45 of the 2022 constitution provides a similar guarantee. However, self-censorship by academics persists in some instances. Students have reported being unable to pursue dissertation research on topics including sexuality and gender identity, or to engage in critiques of Islam’s role in violent extremism.",3,"Private discussion is generally open and free, though public speech on certain topics, including criticism of the military, can draw official reprisals. The criminal ban on same-sex sexual activity also discourages open discussion of issues affecting LGBT+ people.Since 2021, the authorities have increasingly prosecuted journalists, politicians, activists, and social media commentators for speech-related offenses, including insulting the president and defaming the military. The accused, who have been tried in military as well as civilian courts, have generally been individuals with significant online or offline platforms, as opposed to ordinary citizens or social media users. However, the high-profile cases effectively discouraged critical speech more broadly, as did a new presidential decree issued in September 2022 that imposed heavier prison sentences and monetary penalties on individuals who spread “false information or rumors” through online or offline communication networks. Those convicted can face up to 10 years in prison if the content targets public officials. The law also grants civilian and military law enforcement authorities greater latitude to access and search private devices and materials. ",3
turkey,"Most Turkish media networks are owned by businesses that depend on public tenders or have close ties to President Erdoğan. Mainstream media reflect government positions and often carry identical headlines. Although independent outlets exist, they face tremendous political pressure and are routinely targeted for prosecution. Media outlets are often censored, fined, or shut down, and journalists are detained regularly. Business elites with close ties to Erdoğan have been accused of bribing journalists and orchestrating negative press against the opposition.The most prominent journalist arrested in 2022 was Sedef Kabaş, who was detained in January for criticizing President Erdoğan on live television and was sentenced in March to two years and four months in prison. Journalists were detained at various protests throughout the year. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Turkey was the world’s fourth-largest jailer of journalists in 2022, with 40 journalists in prison at the year’s end; the group noted that Turkish authorities had arrested 25 Kurdish journalists in the second half of 2022, all of whom were jailed and charged with terrorism over alleged links to the PKK. Reporters have faced physical attacks, notably those who cover politics, corruption, or crime. The members of Turkey’s state broadcast regulator, the High Council for Broadcasting (RTÜK), are appointed by the AKP-controlled parliament. The RTÜK continued to fine independent networks that critiqued the government in 2022, issuing 54 against five television networks all of which are independent or opposition-aligned. Since 2019, RTÜK has required international online video producers to obtain licenses in order to operate in Turkey. In February 2022, RTÜK warned Euronews, Voice of America, and Deutsche Welle that they were in violation of the rule, and blocked access to the latter two in June after they refused to comply. Authorities also continue to block and censor content on Turkish media. After a deadly bomb attack in Istanbul in November 2022, RTÜK issued a media ban on the topic that lasted 10 hours. In October, the AKP-led majority approved a law that introduced a prison sentence of up to three years for individuals deemed to promote false information on social media. Press freedom advocates and the opposition heavily criticized the law’s vague language and warned that it could be used as a tool to further silence independent journalists. In December, a court ordered the first arrest under the law, placing a Kurdish journalist in pretrial detention for publishing a post on Twitter about the alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl by police officers and soldiers. The journalist was released after his lawyer filed an objection, though the case remained pending at year’s end.Since 2020, the government has forced major social media companies, including Facebook and YouTube, to maintain offices in the country and comply with government demands to take down content. Companies that refused to comply have received hefty fines and advertising bans.",1,"Sunni Islam is the majority religion in Turkey. While the constitution defines a secular state and guarantees freedom of religion, there are limitations on the rights of both recognized and unrecognized religious minorities. The national curriculum mandates compulsory religious education, and while non-Muslim students and Alevis are officially exempted from these courses, they have difficulty opting out of them in practice. Although Jews, Orthodox Christians, and Armenian Catholics are officially recognized as religious minorities in Turkey, disputes over property and prohibitions on training of clergy remain a problem. Alevis and non-Muslims also continue to be targeted with hate speech and mob attacks. In 2022, violent attacks against Alevi institutions rose significantly; between July and August, at least five Alevi NGOs and places of worship were attacked and vandalized.",2,"Academic freedom, never well respected in Turkey, was weakened further by the AKP’s purge of government and civil society workers after the 2016 coup attempt. The government has since dismissed thousands of academics and educators for their perceived leftist, Gülenist, or PKK sympathies. More than a thousand scholars have been investigated and hundreds prosecuted for declaring their support for peace between the government and the PKK. University students are routinely detained for holding peaceful demonstrations against government policies.The government and university administrations routinely intervene to prevent academics from researching sensitive topics, encouraging self-censorship among scholars. President Erdoğan obtained the power to appoint rectors at public and private universities in 2018 and has used it to intervene in academic institutions’ affairs.",1,"While citizens continue to voice their opinions openly in private, many exercise caution about what they say publicly. Ordinary people have faced criminal prosecution for incitement or insulting the president, as have public figures. In August 2022, Turkish pop star Gülşen was arrested for “inciting hatred” after joking during an April performance about religious education. Released in September, she was banned from leaving Turkey until her case was decided.The government heavily monitors and censors the Turkish internet, contributing to an atmosphere of self-censorship. The vaguely written disinformation law that took effect in October 2022 significantly expanded the scope of activities on social media deemed criminal and introduced a three-year maximum prison sentence. The government forced Turkey’s internet providers to restrict access to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and some Telegram servers in the aftermath of a deadly bomb attack in Istanbul in November 2022.",1
turkmenistan,"Press freedom is severely restricted. The state controls nearly all broadcast and print media, and the state-run internet service provider blocks websites that carry independent news coverage or opposition-oriented content. Some citizens access foreign satellite broadcasts, but the government continues efforts to remove receivers from houses in the countryside.Independent journalists, particularly those affiliated with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), experience harassment, detention, physical abuse, and prosecution on trumped-up charges. Turkmenistani authorities have continued to detain Turkmen.news correspondent Nurgeldy Halykov, who was imprisoned in September 2020 on false charges after sharing a photo of a World Health Organization (WHO) delegation in Ashgabat. Halykov has been held in isolation cells on three occasions, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).",0,"Legal restrictions, state monitoring and harassment, and the risk of penalties including fines and imprisonment have virtually extinguished the ability of individuals to freely practice religion. A 2016 law on religion maintained existing bans on religious activity outside state control, imposed a higher membership threshold for the registration of religious groups, and required all registered groups to reapply for registration. Senior Muslim clerics are appointed by the government, and Muslims who do not follow the officially approved interpretation of Islam are subject to persecution, including lengthy prison terms.Members of unregistered religious minority groups continue to face raids, beatings, and other forms of harassment. Turkmenistanis who conscientiously object to compulsory military service for religious reasons risk imprisonment.",0,"The government places significant restrictions on academic freedom, limiting research on politically sensitive topics and imposing onerous obstacles to the recognition of degrees from foreign institutions. Curriculums in schools and universities are controlled by the government.",0,"Private discussion and the expression of personal views are highly restricted due to intrusive supervision by state security services, including physical surveillance, monitoring of telephone and electronic communications, and the use of informers. Users often face disruption to the Internet, and Turkmen.news reported in October 2022 that as many as one-third of all internet protocol (IP) addresses were blocked in the country.In recent years, the government has employed increasingly sophisticated methods to monitor the population. Authorities have reportedly used special software to eavesdrop on voice over internet protocol (VoIP) calls, operate computer cameras remotely, and record keystrokes. Social media users who post critical comments about the government are subject to intimidation and imprisonment, and restrictions on social media sites, cloud storage services, and VPNs have intensified. In January 2022, RFE/RL reported that then-president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov ordered the National Security Ministry to clamp down on people posting on social networks who are critical of the government—people he framed as promoting terrorism and extremism.",0

uganda,"The media sector features many formally independent outlets; however, journalists face intimidation including arrest, harassment, and assault, especially for writing that is critical of the president and his inner circle. Particularly in election years, government authorities raid and shut down radio stations and other outlets and remove accreditation from journalists as retribution for critical reporting.Throughout 2022, journalists were more able to publish articles critical of the government than in previous years, though self-censorship is still common. Social media is a significant part of a robust culture of independent journalism and contributed to the opening of journalistic space.",2,"There is no state religion, and freedom of worship is both constitutionally protected and generally respected in practice. The government seeks to limit and control political statements by religious leaders, tolerating those who support for Museveni and the NRM while subjecting those with more critical views to intimidation, harassment, and arrest.A number of Muslim clerics have been murdered in recent years, and the investigations into the crimes have not yet led to any convictions.",3,"Academic freedom has been undermined by alleged government surveillance of university lectures, and the requirement for professors to obtain permission to hold public meetings at universities. Instances of dismissal and detention of university faculty and leadership are broadly seen as government attempts to censor critical voices. Academics working at public universities fear that researching politically sensitive topics could hinder their career progression. Authorities often respond harshly to campus protests by student groups.",2,"Individuals are nominally free to express their personal views on political and other sensitive topics; however, there is a widespread belief that supporting the opposition will limit one’s future opportunities for education, employment, and government services. Media reports in 2021 indicated that Ugandan intelligence officials used spyware to monitor journalists, political opposition, and foreign diplomats.In addition to monitoring social media platforms, the government has implemented various policies to limit individuals’ online political expression. Facebook has been banned in the country since 2021, though many people access it through virtual private networks (VPNs). In late 2020, the UCC required online content creators to register and pay a $27 fee. In October 2022, the government signed into law the Computer Misuse (Amendment) Act, which criminalizes sharing false or unsolicited information online. Some analysts fear the law will be weaponized against Ugandans who criticize the government online.",2
ukraine,"The constitution guarantees freedoms of speech and expression, and libel is not a criminal offense. Prior to the 2022 war, the media landscape featured considerable pluralism, open criticism of the government, and investigation of powerful figures. However, business magnates owned and influenced many outlets, using them as tools to advance their agendas. A number of Russian news outlets and their journalists were prohibited from entering the country. Various language laws require news outlets to produce certain content in the Ukrainian language. Access to a number of Russian news channels, websites, and social media platforms is banned; residents of Ukraine have otherwise enjoyed unrestricted access to the internet.At the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian government consolidated all television channels under a single government-controlled information platform, United News, that is broadcast around-the-clock on all channels in Ukraine. In late December 2022, Zelenskyy signed into law a controversial bill that expanded the government’s control over print and online media, ostensibly to prevent the potential spread of Russian propaganda. Among other provisions, the law allows authorities to close news sites that are not officially registered as media without a court order, and several journalist groups called it “a threat to free speech,” dictatorial, and a step away from “European Union standards.”Journalists in Ukraine have been targeted by invading Russian forces and continue to face life-threatening risks while carrying out their basic duties. Both Ukrainian and foreign journalists were killed covering the invasion in 2022.  Ukraine’s Institute for Mass Information (IMI) reported that 43 journalists were killed in Russian military attacks, 8 while working and 35 as participants in fighting or as victims of shelling.  The Committee to Protect Journalists confirmed the deaths of at least 13 journalists in the course of their work during the year.",2,"The constitution and a 1991 law define religious rights in Ukraine, and these are generally respected. However, smaller religious groups continue to report some discrimination. Vandalism of Jewish structures and cemeteries continues. Acknowledging one’s atheism may result in discrimination.In 2022, Ukrainian officials arrested several dozen clergy members of the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, one of the country’s two major Orthodox churches, alleging that they had aided the Russian military.",3,"A 2014 law dramatically reduced the government’s control over education and allowed universities much greater freedom in designing their own programs and managing their own finances. A law adopted in 2017 was designed to align the country’s education system with those in the EU, but it drew criticism for provisions that mandated the use of Ukrainian as the primary language of instruction in most publicly funded secondary schools by 2020, affecting numerous schools that taught in minority languages.In Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, occupation authorities forced Ukrainian teachers to follow the Russian school curriculum. Teachers reported that they had been intimidated, threatened, and in some cases tortured for refusing to use the Russian-imposed curriculum. The Russian authorities have destroyed Ukrainian books and ordered teachers to adhere to the Kremlin’s version of history, deny the existence of the Ukrainian nation, and cultivate Russian patriotism among Ukrainian schoolchildren. Some teachers were forcibly sent to Russia to be “retrained.” Parents who refused to send their children to schools in Russian-occupied areas were threatened with fines and revocation of parental rights. In September 2022, Russian officials reported the opening of 1,422 schools for more than 320,000 children in occupied territories of Ukraine.In areas that were successfully liberated by Ukrainian forces, Ukrainian teachers who had worked under Russian control faced criminal investigation, as the Ukrainian criminal code was amended to regard teaching the Russian curriculum in occupied territories of Ukraine as a form of collaboration with the enemy. ",2,"Ukrainians generally enjoy open and free private discussion, although the polarizing effects of years of war have weighed on political expression, especially with regard to questions of individual and national identity. Heated exchanges in the media and instances of violence against those expressing views considered controversial are not uncommon, likely contributing to self-censorship among ordinary people.

A week after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian lawmakers amended the criminal code to expand grounds for collaborationism charges, including public denial by a citizen of Ukraine of Russia’s aggression, glorification of the aggressor state, or insults to the honor and dignity of Ukrainian soldiers. Free expression and other civil society groups were not able to meaningfully review or comment on the draft amendment. Violations are punishable by fines, imprisonment, and restrictions on the ability to “hold certain positions or engage in certain activities” for a period of up to three years. More than 2,000 cases had been filed by year’s end.",2
united-arab-emirates,"The 1980 Publications and Publishing Law, considered one of the most restrictive press laws in the Arab world, regulates all aspects of the media and prohibits criticism of the government. Journalists commonly practice self-censorship, and outlets frequently publish government statements without criticism or comment. Media operate with more freedom in certain “free zones”—areas in which foreign media outlets can produce news content intended for foreign audiences—but the zones remain subject to UAE media laws and have additional regulatory codes and authorities.Emirati-owned and UAE-based media outlets actively participated in a years-long, government-backed media campaign against Qatar. The government sought to influence reporting on Qatar even after it restored relations with that country in 2021.A number of well-known commentators have been jailed in recent years for criticizing the authorities, expressing support for dissidents or human rights, or calling for political reform. Leading human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, who received a 10-year prison term in 2018 for using social media to “publish false information that damages the country’s reputation,” remained behind bars in 2022.In September 2022, the print edition of the Dubai-based newspaper Al-Roeya was shut down, and dozens of employees were dismissed, after the outlet ran an article about the impact of high fuel prices on UAE citizens. Al-Roeya was part of a company owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s deputy prime minister and minister of presidential affairs; the firm claimed that the outlet was closed as part of its planned transformation into CNN Business Arabic, in partnership with the US-based global broadcaster.",0,"Islam is the official religion, and the majority of citizens are Sunni Muslims. Blasphemy is a criminal offense, as is proselytizing to Muslims by non-Muslim groups. The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments provides regular guidance to Muslim preachers; it and a Dubai counterpart appoint the country’s Sunni imams. Shiite clergy have their own council to manage religious affairs.Christian, Hindu, and Sikh places of worship have been built on plots of land donated by ruling family members. Pope Francis became the first Roman Catholic pontiff to visit the Arabian Peninsula when he traveled to the UAE in 2019 as part of a bid by Emirati officials to emphasize the country’s religious tolerance. Later that year, the authorities announced plans to open an Abrahamic Family House, to include a mosque, a church, and a synagogue; the facility was scheduled to open in 2023. Conditions for Jewish residents continued to improve after the UAE and Israel normalized relations in 2020. A Jewish Community Center in Dubai offers services to worshipers, and other members of the growing Jewish population have congregated at residential properties or rented spaces.",2,"The Ministry of Education censors textbooks and curriculums in both public and private schools. Islamic education is required in public schools and for Muslims in private schools. Several foreign universities have opened satellite campuses in the UAE, although faculty members are generally careful to avoid criticizing the government. The UAE authorities have placed scholars and students who have criticized aspects of government policy on a unified Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) security list, barring them from the wider region. In one prominent case in 2018, a British doctoral student was sentenced to life in prison on espionage charges after a minutes-long trial, then pardoned under international pressure and deported.",1,"A number of laws give authorities broad discretion to punish individuals’ speech on sensitive topics. A 2014 counterterrorism law prescribes punishments including the death penalty for offenses like “undermining national security” and possession of material that opposes or denigrates Islam. A 2015 law against hate speech and discrimination contained loosely worded definitions and criminalized a wide range of free-speech activities. A new cybercrime law that took effect in January 2022, replacing its 2006 and 2012 predecessors, features a broad definition of unlawful content; it bans any material that could harm state interests or public confidence in state institutions, among other provisions, and assigns penalties of up to life in prison for use of the internet to oppose the existing system of government. A new penal code that also took effect in January contains similarly expansive prohibitions on speech including false news, defamation, and criticism of the state and its symbols. These and other criminal laws have been actively enforced, including against ordinary social media users. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has reported that the authorities systematically persecute the relatives and associates of jailed or exiled dissidents, for example by revoking their citizenship, withholding identity documents, banning travel, denying them access to education and employment, and subjecting them to surveillance and intimidation. Such practices serve as a further deterrent to unfettered speech.State security agencies engage in extensive surveillance and hacking activities aimed at perceived opponents of the government. They monitor public and private online communications for critical speech and are believed to use advanced commercial spyware products.",1
united-states,"The United States has a free and diverse press, operating under some of the strongest constitutional protections in the world, though media freedom and independence are somewhat impaired by problems including economic constraints, partisan bias and disinformation, and episodes of violence against journalists.The media environment retains a high degree of pluralism, with newspapers, newsmagazines, traditional broadcasters, cable television networks, and news websites competing for readers and audiences. Internet access is widespread and unrestricted. While many larger outlets have prospered, however, independent local sources of news have struggled to keep up with technology-driven changes in news consumption and advertising, contributing to significant ownership consolidation in some sectors, and a number of communities with just one or no local news outlet.News coverage has also grown more polarized, with certain outlets and their star commentators providing a consistently right- or left-leaning perspective. Although the mainstream media have continued to provide strong and independent coverage of national politics despite increased hostility from political figures in recent years, some outlets’ editorial policies effectively shifted to the left as they were drawn into adversarial relationships with the Trump presidency. The highly influential cable network Fox News has been unique, however, in its close alignment with the Republican Party; several prominent on-air personalities and executives migrated to government jobs under the Trump administration, and key hosts have openly endorsed Republican candidates or participated in campaign rallies. In 2022, some Fox News hosts continued to promote far-right and conspiracist views. In October 2022, the Justice Department formally adopted regulations that prohibited federal authorities—with narrow exceptions—from seizing the records of journalists or requiring their testimony in order to identify confidential sources as part of leak investigations. The move, which codified a policy change issued by the attorney general in 2021, came in response to revelations that the department under Trump had secretly sought or obtained the records of journalists from multiple news outlets while investigating leaks. A growing number of Americans look to social media and other online sources for political news, increasing their exposure to disinformation and propagandistic content of both foreign and domestic origin. The larger platforms have struggled to control false or hateful material without harming freedom of expression or their own business interests, though they have engaged in mass removals of far-right and foreign accounts that are used to spread disinformation. Following the January 2021 attack on Congress, the perceived risk of further incitement of violence by Trump prompted Twitter to ban his account, and Facebook and YouTube imposed indefinite suspensions. Late in 2022, after Twitter was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk, the platform reinstated Trump and thousands of other suspended users as part of a new emphasis on free speech, while temporarily banning several journalists for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Many advertisers responded to the turmoil by pausing their spending on Twitter.In 2021, the Republican-led states of Florida and Texas adopted laws that aimed to restrict social media platforms’ ability to moderate content and suspend certain accounts, though enforcement of both measures was blocked pending judicial review. A federal appeals court overturned much of the Florida law in May 2022, while in September, a different appeals court upheld Texas’s statute, setting the stage for a resolution by the Supreme Court. Separately, New York and California adopted laws in June and September, respectively, that require platforms to be more transparent about their content moderation policies.While criminal violence against journalists in the United States has been rare in recent decades, investigative journalist Jeff German was murdered in Las Vegas in September 2022. A local official who had been the subject of German’s reporting was arrested and charged with the crime. Media watchdog groups registered widespread press freedom violations—including police violence and arbitrary arrests targeting journalists—in the context of the nationwide protests sparked in 2020 by the police killing of George Floyd, a Black civilian, in Minnesota that May. According to the US Press Freedom Tracker, a joint project of multiple nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the number of violations has since declined sharply, falling to 15 arrests or detentions of journalists and 38 assaults on journalists in 2022, from 123 arrests and 334 assaults recorded during 2020. The latest incidents largely occurred during political protests. In June 2022, press freedom groups objected to a Supreme Court ruling that made it more difficult for journalists and others to seek monetary damages from federal officials who use excessive force or unlawful searches.",3,"The United States has a long tradition of religious freedom. The constitution protects the free exercise of religion while barring any official endorsement of a religious faith, and there are no direct government subsidies to houses of worship. The debate over the role of religion in public life is ongoing, however, and religious groups often mobilize to influence political discussions on the diverse issues in which they take an interest. The Supreme Court regularly adjudicates difficult cases involving the relationship between religion and the state. In 2022, the court issued several rulings that eased restrictions designed to avoid the appearance of an official endorsement of religion, for example by authorizing public funding of religious schools under some circumstances.Hate crimes based on religion are generally prosecuted vigorously by law enforcement authorities. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics for 2020, released in 2021, showed a decrease of some 15 percent in such crimes from 2019; incidents involving Jewish targets constituted over 56 percent of the year’s religion-based hate crimes, and anti-Muslim crimes were the next most common category. FBI data covering 2021, released in 2022, were incomplete due to poor rates of reporting by local police departments, but separate studies in 2022 reported data indicating a rise in antisemitic hate crimes.",4,"The academic sphere has long featured a high level of intellectual freedom. While it remains quite robust by global standards, this liberty has come under pressure from both ends of the political spectrum. University faculty have reported instances of professional repercussions or harassment—including on social media—related to curriculum content, textbooks, or statements that some students strongly disagreed with. As a consequence, some professors have engaged in self-censorship. Students on a number of campuses have obstructed guest speakers whose views they find objectionable. In the most highly publicized cases, students and nonstudent activists have physically prevented presentations by controversial speakers, especially those known for their views on race, gender, immigration, Middle East politics, and other sensitive issues. On a number of university campuses, such pressures were associated largely with the progressive left, but social and political forces on the right have increasingly applied pressure of their own in recent years. The Trump administration in 2020 ordered recipients of federal funds, including universities, to avoid diversity training that includes “divisive concepts” related to racism and sexism, prompting expressions of concern regarding impingements on academic freedom from numerous university administrators. A federal judge blocked implementation of the order, but in 2021 state-level officials initiated a wave of similar legislation pertaining to both universities and public schools—a trend that continued in 2022. These efforts were especially focused on restricting the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT), an academic framework for examining a variety of issues including structural racism, and on constraining classroom discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity. According to PEN America, lawmakers in at least seven states had adopted increasingly punitive “educational gag orders” restricting the forms and substance of classroom discussions on race and sexuality by August 2022, in addition to the dozen states that had passed such bills in 2021. Moreover, educators and administrators who were concerned about accreditation, legal liability, and parental anger reportedly acted preemptively to eliminate or alter courses and remove previously well-regarded texts from school libraries. Some library organizations sought to counter the trend by promoting online access to banned books across state lines.These debates took place against the backdrop of a sharp rise in threats and intimidation aimed at school officials, and as increasingly well-funded and organized conservative or right-wing parents’ groups engaged in extensive efforts to control school curriculums and the materials offered in school and public libraries.",3,"Americans are generally free to engage in private discussion and air their personal views in public settings, including on the internet, though there are a number of threats to this freedom.Civil libertarians, many lawmakers, and other observers have pointed to the real and potential effects of the government’s collection of communications data and other forms of intelligence-related monitoring on the rights of US residents, despite the adoption of significant reforms since such activities surged following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Separately, surveillance programs run by federal and local law enforcement agencies have long raised concerns among civil liberties groups, due in part to allegations of a disproportionate focus on religious, racial, and ethnic minority communities. A growing number of law enforcement and other government agencies are monitoring public social media content, with targets including applicants for US visas and participants in protests.A public debate about law enforcement access to encrypted communication services continues, with some officials warning that their technical inability to break encryption even with a judicial warrant poses a threat to the rule of law, and opponents arguing that any weakening of encrypted services’ security would expose all users to criminal hacking and other ill effects.Aside from concerns about government surveillance, internet users in the United States have faced problems such as aggressive disinformation efforts, intimidation, and frequently sexualized harassment on social media that may deter them from engaging in online discussion and expressing their views freely.",4
united-kingdom,"Press freedom is legally protected. The media environment is lively and competitive, espousing viewpoints spanning the political spectrum. The publicly owned British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which relies on dedicated license fees for most of its funding, is largely viewed as editorially independent and competitive with its commercial counterparts. In an August 2022 speech, former news presenter Emily Maitlis criticized a member of the BBC Board for serving as an “active agent of the Conservative Party.” The BBC rejected her claims that month.Journalists face regular harassment; a 2020 National Union of Journalists (NUJ) survey found that over half of its members encountered online abuse, while nearly a quarter were physically attacked. The government published its first-ever National Action Plan to enhance the safety of journalists in 2021. In August 2022, six antilockdown activists received convictions for verbally abusing and chasing BBC journalist Nicholas Watt on a London street in 2021. Five were handed community sentences. Paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have also issued threats against journalists in recent years. In June 2022, the NUJ condemned a pro-UK paramilitary group for threatening a journalist operating in Belfast.Parliament considered the Online Safety Bill (OSB), which would restrict online access to material deemed illegal or harmful, in 2022. In July, the government amended the OSB to prevent the arbitrary removal of news content from online platforms.In July 2022, the Justice Ministry said the government would legislate to address strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs). In November, the Solicitors Regulation Authority warned that lawyers involved in SLAPPs would face disciplinary action.",4,"Freedom of religion is protected in law and practice. A 2006 law bans incitement to religious hatred, with a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. Nevertheless, minority groups, particularly Muslims, continue to report discrimination, harassment, and occasional assault. The Home Office recorded 3,459 religiously based hate crimes in England and Wales against Muslims during its 2021–22 reporting period; 1,919 were recorded against Jewish people, the second-largest targeted group. Muslims have been reluctant to discuss religious subjects or their identity in some settings, especially in the classroom, due to Prevent, a strategy designed to divert individuals vulnerable to terrorist or extremist recruitment. Prevent has been criticized for forcing Muslims to self-censor for fear of referral.In 2021, William Shawcross—who was accused of fostering an “institutional bias against Muslims” as head of the UK’s Charity Commission—was appointed to chair an independent review into Prevent. A draft report from the Shawcross-led review, which said that the government should focus more on Islamist extremism than right-wing threats, was leaked in May 2022. A final report was not published by year’s end.",4,"Academic freedom is generally respected, though the government has recently made political forays into the academic curriculum. A draft law on freedom of speech in higher education remained under parliamentary consideration at the end of 2022. The bill, which would introduce fines for English universities deemed to have restricted free speech, has been criticized by freedom-of-expression groups on grounds that it may allow the government to define “acceptable speech” at universities. The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 requires schools and universities to help divert students from recruitment into terrorist groups, as part of the Prevent strategy. Educators are expected to report students suspected of terrorist or extremist sympathies to a local government body and vet the remarks of visiting speakers, among other obligations.",3,"Concerns about the effects of mass surveillance on unfettered private discussion have persisted for several years. The Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) 2016 required communications companies to store customer metadata for 12 months, which authorities could sometimes access without a warrant. The government later limited access to metadata for serious criminal investigations with the approval of an independent commission after the High Court ruled the legislation incompatible with European Union (EU) jurisprudence in 2018. Other legal challenges against the IPA continued in 2022.The government published a draft of the OSB for parliamentary scrutiny in April 2022. Among other things, the draft required online platforms to remove or restrict content deemed illegal or harmful and placed related responsibilities on Ofcom, the country’s media regulator. In November, the government amended the OSB to require that social media firms only remove content that is illegal or violates their own standards. Provisions on legal material considered harmful to adults were removed. The OSB remained under consideration at year’s end.",3
uruguay,"Constitutional guarantees regarding free expression are generally respected. The press is privately owned; the broadcast sector includes both commercial and public outlets. There are numerous daily and weekly newspapers, some of which are connected to political parties.  Journalists have faced increasing pressure due to their work in recent years, including being targeted with civil lawsuits and threats for their reporting. The Center for Archives and Access to Public Information (CAinfo), a Uruguayan information rights organization, has registered a growing number of constraints on freedom of expression for journalists in the country in recent years. A CAinfo report published in May 2022 noted that the number of threats and restrictions journalists were subjected to during its 2021–22 reporting period increased by 40 percent over the previous year, marking the third consecutive year in which such incidents had increased. Media freedom advocates, including the Latin American Internet Association (ALAI), have also expressed concern about measures in the Accountability Bill (Rendición de Cuentas) submitted to Parliament in June 2022. Critics fear that certain measures in the bill, intended to block illegal broadcasts online, could be invoked to limit freedom of expression more broadly.",3,Freedom of religion is legally protected and broadly respected.,4,"Academic freedom is generally upheld. However, some have expressed concerns about the preservation of autonomy and self-governance within the university system. In November 2022, the Senate passed a bill that, if adopted, would modify how the Technological University of Uruguay’s (UTEC) board of directors is selected, including by giving the government the power to appoint board members.",4,"Discussion of personal and political topics is generally open and robust, and there is little fear of government surveillance or retribution.",4
uzbekistan,"Despite constitutional guarantees, press freedom remains severely restricted. The state controls major media outlets and related facilities, and independent outlets were mostly shuttered or blocked under Karimov. However, domestic media, including news websites and live television programs, now cautiously discuss social problems and criticize local officials, reflecting a slight reduction in media repression since Mirziyoyev took power. Some independent news sources have emerged and are not subject to overt censorship, though most outlets still avoid openly criticizing Mirziyoyev and the government. Under Mirziyoyev, a number of journalists have been released from prison, and 2018 marked the first year in two decades that no journalists were imprisoned.The presence of independent international outlets is limited; several foreign reporters have been granted press passes since 2017, although other journalists working for outlets like RFE/RL have been denied entry. Access to news and information via popular social media sites like YouTube and Facebook has become more reliable in recent years despite the authorities’ sporadic blocking of such platforms. Independent journalists are frequently harassed or interrogated by the security services for their coverage of topics that are deemed to be sensitive by the authorities. In 2022, numerous journalists reporting on the Russian military invasion of Ukraine were warned by the state security services to “exercise restraint” in their coverage of the war, and some were reportedly ordered to delete their work. Journalists continue to face criminal penalties for a variety of possible offenses related to their work. In 2020, the president signed legal amendments that eliminated prison terms for libel and insult, but compulsory labor and other penalties remained in place, and dissemination of false information was added to the criminal and administrative codes. In February 2022, blogger Sobirjon Babaniyazov was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for purportedly insulting President Mirziyoyev on social media. In January, blogger Miraziz Bazarov, who has reported on government corruption and advocated for LGBT+ rights, was sentenced to three years of house arrest on slander charges for allegedly making comments insulting teachers and progovernment bloggers on social media. Journalists were not granted access to the courtroom during his trial.  In June and July 2022, during the public hearing period on the proposed constitutional amendments on Karakalpakstan and the protests that followed, prominent ethnic Karakalpak bloggers and journalists who published criticism of the proposed amendments were arrested by local authorities; at least one, Kural Rametov, was reportedly tortured while in custody. The state has also continued to occasionally use the Soviet-era practice of forced psychiatric hospitalization against journalists.",1,"The government permits the existence of approved Muslim, Jewish, and Christian denominations, but treats unregistered religious activity as a criminal offense. Suspected members of banned Muslim organizations and their relatives have faced arrest, interrogation, and torture. Arrested believers are frequently accused of founding previously unknown religious organizations, a charge that carries high penalties. In most cases, little evidence of the existence of such organizations is presented at the closed trials. Since Mirziyoyev became president in 2016, government regulations curtailing religious freedom have lessened, though significant restrictions remain in place as of 2022. In 2021, Mirziyoyev signed new amendments to the law on religious freedom, relaxing a controversial prohibition on wearing religious clothing in public, including in state and educational institutions, as well as simplifying the registration requirements for religious organizations. However, human rights activists and international monitors have noted that the reforms do not fundamentally change the state’s authority to license religious organizations, censor religious literature, and prosecute anyone participating in religious activities or teaching outside state-approved forums. While mandatory dress codes that effectively prohibit the wearing of religious attire in public schools remain in place, as of the end of 2022 these rules are reportedly no longer being enforced in practice. Despite the expansion of some religious freedoms, security services have continued to use broadly defined terrorism and slander legislation to target religious individuals and activists. In January 2022, Muslim blogger Fazilhoja Arifhojaev was convicted of “threatening public security and public order” and sentenced to more than seven years in prison for criticizing the government’s religious policies on social media. His sentence was upheld on appeal in March. ",1,"The government has long limited academic freedom, in part by controlling contacts between universities or scholars and foreign entities. Universities in Uzbekistan have slowly expanded their cooperation with foreign counterparts since 2016. Texts that glorify former president Karimov are no longer required reading at universities.",1,"The freedoms of personal expression and private discussion have long been limited by mahalla committees—traditional neighborhood organizations that the government transformed into an official system for public surveillance and control. The government also engages in extensive surveillance of electronic communications.Through its various reforms since 2016, the Mirziyoyev administration has signaled a greater tolerance for public criticism, modestly improving the climate for expression of personal views on sensitive topics. However, the 2020 legal amendments that criminalized dissemination of false information, including about COVID-19, indicated ongoing pressure to set limits on public debate.",1
vanuatu,"The government generally respects freedom of the press, though elected officials have sometimes been accused of threatening journalists for critical reporting. Publicly and privately owned newspapers publish in English and French. There are a small number of private broadcasters, but the state-owned broadcaster is dominant. Foreign news services are also available, and about a quarter of the population has access to the internet.In 2019, the government rejected a work-permit renewal request from Canadian journalist Dan McGarry, publisher of the Daily Post newspaper, and barred him from returning to the country. McGarry claimed that the government retaliated against the newspaper’s coverage of Chinese influence in Vanuatu; the Supreme Court revoked the travel ban at the end of 2019, allowing McGarry to return. His work permit has still gone unrenewed as of the end of 2022.The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, which amended numerous laws, provides criminal penalties of up to three years’ imprisonment for threatening language, libel, and slander.",2,"The constitution’s preamble states that the republic is founded on “Christian principles,” but there is no official religion.

venezuela,"The media operate within a highly restrictive regulatory and legal environment. Venezuela formerly benefited from vibrant newspaper, television, and radio sectors, but many outlets have been forced to close or narrow their operations over the past decade. The country had just 22 print newspapers as of 2021, down from 121 in 2013, and dozens of radio stations were closed by the government during 2022 alone. The Maduro regime maintains a state-controlled media infrastructure that promotes its political and ideological program.In February 2022, PSUV vice president Diosdado Cabello took possession of the headquarters of the newspaper El Nacional after the courts awarded him ownership as part of a defamation suit against the outlet. The website of El Nacional has repeatedly been subjected to blocking and censorship.Independent journalists are at risk of government pressure, arbitrary arrest, and physical violence. In February 2022, journalists Ramón Centeno and Gabriel Guerra were arrested and held without trial after interviewing people who were allegedly involved in drug trafficking. Photographer Carlos Debíais remained in detention after being arrested in 2021 for flying a drone over an oil refinery. The NGO Public Space (Espacio Público) documented 157 violations of freedom of expression, including censorship and intimidation, during the first nine months of 2022. Another media freedom group, Press and Society Institute (IPYS), reported in 2022 that there had been 452 alerts related to press freedom, freedom of expression, and access to information during 2021, with restrictions on access to information and aggression against journalists among the most common types of violations.",1,"Constitutional guarantees of religious freedom are generally respected, though relations between the government and the Roman Catholic Church remain tense. According to the 2021 edition of the US State Department’s Report on International Religious Freedom, Roman Catholic and evangelical Christian groups alleged government harassment, intimidation, and retaliation against their members, including members of the clergy. The report also noted a pattern of antisemitic content in regime-affiliated media outlets and social media posts.",3,"Academic freedom has come under mounting pressure in recent years, as budget cuts and other funding problems have undermined universities’ autonomy and prompted an exodus of academics from the country.The regime continued to exert political influence over university leadership during 2022. The Universidad Central de Venezuela, the largest institution of higher education in the country, held elections in July to choose members of the governing bodies for its different faculties and schools. The progovernment candidates lost in all the faculties and in 44 of the 49 schools, but the TSJ partially suspended the results, and the winners were unable to take their posts.",1,"The freedom of personal expression is severely constrained in Venezuela, due in part to the deterrent effect of extensive government surveillance. In June 2022, the Spanish telecommunications firm Movistar, which operates in Venezuela, reported that Maduro’s government had made more than 860,000 requests for telephone interceptions during 2021, affecting over 1.5 million phone numbers. These requests, nearly all of which were accepted, have increased dramatically from just 380,000 in 2016. The government has also used social service and health care systems to surveil Venezuelans; the Fatherland Card, an electronic identification document, is used both to distribute social aid and influence citizens’ online activity.Social media users have faced various threats and punishments for posts that are unfavorable to the authorities. In April 2022, for example, a 72-year-old woman was arrested for a TikTok video in which she mocked the regime. She was released on the condition that she post an apology video and remain under court supervision.",1
vietnam,"Although the constitution recognizes freedom of the press, journalists and bloggers are constrained by numerous repressive laws and decrees. The criminal code prohibits speech that is critical of the government, while a 2006 decree prescribes fines for any publication that denies revolutionary achievements, spreads “harmful” information, or exhibits “reactionary ideology.” Decree 72, issued in 2013, gave the state sweeping new powers to restrict speech on blogs and social media. The state controls all print and broadcast media.A 2018 cybersecurity law requires companies like Facebook and Google to store information about Vietnamese users in Vietnam and allows the government, in collaboration with technology firms, to block access to a broad range of news and information that is deemed a threat to national security. Although Hanoi has complained at times that global technology firms are not doing enough to block problematic content, in practice the companies have reportedly complied with most of the government’s requests.A decree issued in August 2022 detailed the implementation of the cybersecurity law’s data localization requirements, and the regulation took effect in October. In November, the Ministry of Information and Communications announced that major tech platforms would be required take down “false” content within 24 hours of an official request or face serious sanctions. The limit had previously been set at 48 hours.Arrests, assaults, and criminal convictions of journalists and bloggers continued to be reported in 2022. In January, former journalist Mai Phan Lợi, creator of the nonprofit Center for Media in Education Community, received a four-year prison sentence after being convicted on dubious tax-fraud charges. In July, the authorities arrested prominent blogger Nguyễn Lân Thắng, who has long contributed to US-based Radio Free Asia, for supposedly promoting antistate propaganda. At year’s end the authorities continued to detain war veteran and activist Trần Văn Bang, who had been arrested in March for Facebook posts that supposedly included “antistate propaganda.” According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 21 journalists were imprisoned for their work in Vietnam as of December 2022.",0,"Religious freedom remains restricted. All religious groups and most individual clergy members are required to join a party-controlled supervisory body and obtain permission for most activities. The 2016 Law on Belief and Religion reinforced registration requirements, allowed extensive state interference in religious groups’ internal affairs, and gave authorities broad discretion to penalize unsanctioned religious activity.Unregistered and unrecognized religious groups face routine harassment, including violence, criminal charges, and property damage. In July 2022, six members of the Peng Lei Buddhist House, which had refused to register with the official Buddhist organization, were sentenced to a combined 23 years and six months in prison for “abusing democratic freedoms.” In December, an independent Buddhist Unified Church of Vietnam pagoda in Kon Tum Province was destroyed by local authorities.",1,Academic freedom is limited. University professors face punishment if they criticize government policies or fail to adhere to party views when teaching or writing on political topics.,1,"Although citizens enjoy more freedom in private discussions than in the past, authorities continue to attack and imprison those who openly criticize the state, including on social media. The government engages in surveillance of private online activity.In 2022, authorities fined and jailed a wide range of ordinary citizens and more prominent activists for critiquing the state’s COVID-19 response, its development strategies, CPV leaders, and many other topics related to the government. The Vietnam Human Rights Network found that 48 people were arrested for speech-related offenses between the beginning of 2021 and the end of May 2022.",1
yemen,"The state has historically controlled most terrestrial television and radio, though there have been several privately owned radio stations.

Houthi-backed authorities reportedly block certain news websites, online messaging and social media platforms, and satellite broadcasts.All sides in the conflict have subjected journalists to harassment, arbitrary arrests and detentions, violent attacks, and enforced disappearances. At least one journalist was killed in Yemen during 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, for a total of at least 29 killed since 2015.",0,"Islam is the official religion, and the constitution declares Sharia (Islamic law) to be the source of all legislation. A small number of Yemenis belong to non-Muslim religious groups; their rights have traditionally been respected in practice, though conversion from Islam and proselytizing to Muslims is prohibited. Christian converts and members of the Baha’i and Jewish communities in the north have encountered increased persecution under Houthi rule. Houthi authorities reportedly enforce their interpretation of the Zaidi Shiite faith among Muslims.  The militant group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) poses a threat to non–Sunni Muslim residents, particularly in the southeast.Since the outbreak of the war in 2015, assassinations and other violent attacks on religious clerics have increased, and combatants on all sides have destroyed many religious buildings across the country. Progovernment forces have allegedly seized or destroyed Shiite religious sites.",1,"Since 2015, Houthi officials have been accused of skewing the curriculum in schools and universities to promote their political ideology. Houthi authorities have also dismissed and replaced faculty and administrators who are deemed politically disloyal, and repeatedly detained and prosecuted scholars and students as part of their crackdown on dissent. Outspoken academics face a heightened risk of physical violence from the Houthis as well as other armed groups and progovernment forces, and some scholars have been killed by unidentified assailants in recent years.The war has caused damage to educational facilities across the country, suspension of classes and other activities at many schools and universities, and deaths of children caught in either errant or deliberate military attacks on schools.

zambia,"Press freedom is constitutionally guaranteed but restricted in practice. Public outlets continue to exhibit a progovernment bias while private outlets are largely polarized. Self-censorship remains common. Police officers have arrested and intimidated journalists for reporting critical stories; journalists have also faced retaliation from political actors. Press freedom is also impacted by the 2021 Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes Act (CSCCA), which received civil society criticism upon its passage. In 2022, at least eight journalists were detained or arrested in the course of their work.

In January 2022, KBN TV aired a recording in which two government officials allegedly discussed manipulating the affairs of the opposition DP ahead of a by-election. Two days later, authorities interrogated a KBN TV manager and investigated her under the CSCCA. In November, two MUVI TV staff members were detained while covering the arrest of EEP leader Chilufya Tayali.

In an August 2022 report released by the Open Spaces Zambia initiative, 34 journalists and three media houses reported harassment and threats from police, political-party figures, and government officials between January and June. In May, MISA Zambia objected to a local official’s efforts to influence the staffing and broadcasting decisions of Kasempa Radio. In late December, UPND supporters disrupted operations at Kokoliko FM as Tayali of the EEP was being featured in a radio program.

In September 2022, the Labor Ministry reported that 41 percent of women journalists were harassed at work; just one in five incidents was reported.",1,Constitutional protections for religious freedom are generally respected.,3,The government generally does not restrict academic freedom and student associations freely protest issues of a political nature.,2,"Zambians enjoy some freedom of private discussion, though a penal-code provision criminalizing insults towards the president remained in force for much of 2022. Before the provision’s December repeal, ordinary citizens were arrested for allegedly insulting Hichilema; two people received hard-labor sentences as recently as June for this offense. Civil society had called on the president to repeal the provision in September, saying it was being used against government critics.Online activity is also impacted by the CSCCA. In 2021, Collaboration on International Information and Communication Technology Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), a nongovernmental organization (NGO), warned that the act offered limited data-interception protections and criminalized the possession or transmission of content that would “corrupt morals,” though CIPESA also noted that some of the act’s provisions required a warrant. In September 2022, Technology Minister Felix Mutati said the government intended to amend the CSCCA to better address cybercrime.While in power, the PF acquired the capability to monitor digital communications, which then minister Brian Mushimba admitted in 2018 when he said the government was targeting online abuse. In 2020, then president Lungu said that the Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority could track social media activity.",2

Many Zimbabweans rely on radio, but media diversity is limited by sustained refusals to grant licenses to community radio stations. Commercial radio licenses usually go to state-controlled companies or individuals connected to ZANU-PF. The government controls the two main daily newspapers, though there are several independent print outlets. In 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe broke the ZBC’s monopoly by issuing new television broadcasting licenses.
