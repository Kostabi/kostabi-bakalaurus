afghanistan,"The regime places significant restrictions on individual movement, especially on women. Women must be accompanied by a chaperone for long-distance domestic travel and travel abroad. In March 2022, airline officials reported that unaccompanied women were removed from flights.Authorities have used checkpoints to regulate internal movement and are known to engage in intrusive searches of travelers. Taliban reportedly search for known or perceived opponents of the regime at checkpoints, checking travelers’ mobile phones and social media activity.The regime rationed access to passports in 2022 in an effort to restrict emigration. It stopped issuing passports in October. The Taliban maintained a quota of passports for its own members, while others paid bribes and sought travel documents on the black market.Internal displacement remains a significant problem. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported that 3.5 million Afghans were internally displaced at the end of 2022.",0,"The Taliban have historically promised to respect existing property rights and provide enough security to allow for investment. However, the Taliban continued a pattern of property expropriation and extortion directed at the those affiliated with the defunct republic. Traders have complained of being driven out of business by arbitrary tax assessments. In some provinces, armed gangs have kidnapped and stolen from targets perceived as wealthy; these gangs are protected by the authorities. The Taliban have signaled that they would assert state ownership of land based on prerevolutionary records, effectively nullifying four decades’ worth of transactions.",1,"The Taliban ended the limited formal protections from domestic violence offered by the republic. Shelters for survivors of gender-based violence were closed by the Taliban and individuals who were convicted of such violence were among those released by the Taliban during their 2021 takeover.The MVV has restricted the social freedoms of Afghans. Women are obliged to adopt Islamic dress as defined by the regime. Men, especially civil servants, were ordered to grow full beards and avoid “westernized” hairstyles or dress. However, enforcement is reportedly inconsistent.Customary practices, including child marriage, the forced marriage of young girls to older men, and of widows to their husbands’ male relatives, continue to restrict women’s choices regarding marriage and divorce.",0,"The economic and governance crisis associated with the Taliban takeover intensified poverty and heightened Afghans’ vulnerability to exploitation, while weakening safeguards. Aid agencies fear that as many as 120,000 children have been bartered or sold into marriage in the first eight months of the new regime’s rule.Food insecurity is pervasive; in May 2022, the WFP reported that 92 percent of Afghans do not eat enough food. Women and people living with disabilities were especially affected. Child labor has reportedly increased as Afghan families grapple with the country’s economic crisis, with more children working in the mining sector.",1
albania,"Albanians generally enjoy freedom of movement, though criminal activity and practices related to historically predominant honor codes limit these rights in some areas. People are generally free to change their place of residence or employment. Access to government documents is affected by bribery.",3,"Numerous property restitution cases related to communist-era confiscations remain unresolved. Illegal construction is a major problem, as is bribery linked to government approval of development projects. Women continue to face serious challenges to fair and equal property inheritance from parents as well as when divorcing their husbands.",2,"The government generally does not place explicit restrictions on social freedoms, though same-sex marriages are not recognized. Domestic violence is widespread. Police are poorly equipped to handle cases of domestic violence or spousal rape, which is often not understood to be a crime.",2,"Albania has relatively robust labor laws but lacks the capacity to enforce workplace safety and other protections. Conditions in the manufacturing, construction, and mining sectors are often substandard and put workers at risk. While Albania continues to struggle with human trafficking, authorities are proactive in addressing the issue. In recent years, the government has cooperated with civil society leaders, creating an advisory board on trafficking and increasing victim assistance in criminal proceedings.",2
algeria,"While most citizens are relatively free to travel domestically and abroad, the authorities closely monitor and limit access to visas for non-Algerians. Men of military draft age cannot leave the country without official consent. The land border between Algeria and Morocco remains closed. Police reportedly limit the movement of sub-Saharan African migrants attempting to reach the Mediterranean coast. Married women younger than 18 must obtain the permission of their husbands to travel abroad.The government has at times banned Algerian diaspora activists from leaving the country. At least three Algerian-Canadian activists were temporarily prevented from leaving in 2022. All three were interrogated about their potential links to the Hirak, but were later able to return to Canada.",2,"The government plays a dominant role in the economy, leaving little room for private competitors. Cronyism is also a major obstacle to private enterprise, with businesspeople who are not aligned with the regime often facing harassment by the authorities. Numerous regulations and their flawed implementation make Algeria one of the most difficult environments in the world in which to establish and operate a business. Inheritance rules favor men over women.",2,"Women do not enjoy equal rights in marriage and divorce under the family code, which is based on Islamic law. Among other provisions, women must obtain a male guardian’s permission to marry, and the father is the legal guardian of his children. No law addresses spousal rape.Domestic violence is common, and the laws against it are weak; for example, cases can be dropped if the victim forgives the alleged abuser. Women’s rights groups report that between 100 and 200 women are killed in domestic abuse incidents each year.",2,"The weak rule of law, government involvement in the economy, and bureaucratic obstacles pose major barriers to economic opportunity and social mobility. Laws against unsafe or abusive working conditions are poorly enforced.A 2009 law criminalized all forms of trafficking in persons, and Algeria reported its first conviction under the law in 2015. In recent years, the government has made an effort to enforce the ban through prosecutions and has provided protection for victims, though not systematically. Undocumented sub-Saharan African migrants are particularly susceptible to trafficking, including through debt bondage and sexual exploitation.",1
andorra,"There are few restrictions on freedom of movement, and people are generally free to change their place of residence, employment, and education. The government imposed temporary restrictions on travel and internal movement during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",4,"The legal and regulatory framework is generally supportive of property rights and entrepreneurship, and there are few undue obstacles to private business activity in practice.",4,"Personal social freedoms are generally respected, though there are some restrictions for same-sex couples. In July 2022, the government adopted a comprehensive new family code that legalized civil marriage for same-sex couples, set to enter into force in 2023. However, in December, Andorra’s Constitutional Court deemed the code’s distinction between canonical and civil marriage to be discrimination “on the basis of religious convictions” and thus unconstitutional, meaning that parts of the law must be amended before entering into force. Among other things, the new law also permits no-fault divorce and allows transgender people to change their name and gender on legal documents.Domestic violence is prohibited by law and punishable with prison sentences; the government pursues domestic violence cases and provides resources for victims. Nevertheless, such violence remains a serious problem, and sometimes involves violence against children. The CoE’s 2020 report on Andorra’s implementation of the Istanbul Convention—a treaty on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence—listed a number of shortcomings in the collection of data and the support system for victims of sexual violence.Andorra remains one of the few countries in Europe where abortion is completely prohibited, with penalties for both doctors and patients who undergo the procedure. Abortion is relatively accessible in neighboring France and Spain, though this option can be expensive for Andorrans.",3,"Andorran laws provide protections for most workers, including migrant workers. However, temporary workers must leave the country when their employment contract expires, exposing those with expired contracts to potential abuse by employers. The Labor Inspections Office is proactive in addressing violations of workers’ rights.A 2019 report from the CoE’s Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) found that Andorra had made legislative and policy progress on combating trafficking but called on authorities to scrutinize high-risk sectors for possible victims and raise awareness of the threat among law enforcement bodies. Confirmed cases of trafficking have been rare in practice.",4
angola,"Several organizations have been working to remove land mines that were placed during Angola’s 1975–2002 civil war. The mines inhibit agriculture, construction, and freedom of movement, particularly in rural areas.There have been reports by local NGOs that the authorities and private security groups guarding Lunda Norte Province’s diamond mines restrict the movements of local residents.The process for securing entry and exit visas remains difficult and mired in corruption. Bribes are frequently required in order to obtain employment and residence.",1,Predatory elites tend to either disrupt or co-opt emerging new businesses. Authorities have at times expropriated land and demolished homes without providing compensation. Customary law practices can leave women with unequal inheritance rights.,1,"While residents enjoy some freedom with respect to personal status issues like marriage and divorce, child marriage remains common, particularly in rural areas. Same-sex marriage is not recognized. Domestic violence is widespread in Angola, and perpetrators are rarely prosecuted.",1,"Public oil revenues are not equitably distributed or used to benefit the entire population. Rural regions in particular have inadequate infrastructure and access to services, leading to inequities in economic opportunity.Child labor is a major problem, and foreign workers are vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor in the construction and mining industries. The authorities have failed to effectively investigate human trafficking or prosecute offenders.",0
antigua-and-barbuda,"Individuals enjoy freedom of movement, including the ability to change their place of residence, employment, or education.",4,"Many Barbudans forced to evacuate the island due to Hurricane Irma in 2017 opposed moves by lawmakers in Antigua to eliminate the communal land ownership system that governed the island for almost two centuries, and instead establish private land ownership.The development of a multimillion-dollar private resort on Barbuda has driven tensions between the Browne government and Barbudan population and their representatives, who are concerned about the environmental impacts of the development. The Browne government has threatened those who attempt to obstruct the plans with jail time. In June, Antigua and Barbuda’s final appellate court, the UK-based Privy Council, rejected a challenge to the Paradise Found Act 2015, which the appellants argued violated their constitutional right of “protection from deprivation of property” and infringed on communal land rights in Barbuda.",3,"The Domestic Violence Act of 2015 strengthened punishments for perpetrators of domestic violence and laid out a process for victims to obtain an order of protection. However, domestic violence remains a serious problem. In October, Antigua’s House of Representatives passed the Sexual Offenders Registry Bill, enacting increased monitoring of sex offenders and facilitating the sharing of information among jurisdictions. Debate on the bill involved balancing concerns between protecting victims and allowing for the rehabilitation of remorseful offenders.Same-sex marriage and civil partnerships are not recognized.",3,"Antigua and Barbuda is a destination and transit country for the trafficking of men, women, and children for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation. Government efforts to address the problem are inadequate, but progress is being made, according to the US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons report. Compulsory labor is prohibited by law.In May 2022, the government ratified the ILO’s Violence and Harassment Convention. The document recognizes the right to go to work without experiencing violence and harassment with an emphasis on abuses experienced by women in the workplace, a well as the effects of domestic violence on women’s ability to work.",3
argentina,"The government generally respects citizens’ constitutional right to travel both inside and outside of Argentina. People are free to change their place of education or employment.Argentina implemented one of the world’s strictest and most prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns. Bans and restrictions on domestic and international travel were sometimes arbitrary and gave way to abuses; security officers used disproportionate force to enforce measures. Almost all COVID-19-related restrictions were lifted in September 2021, including border controls. The government continued to ease remaining travel restrictions during 2022.",4,"Citizens generally enjoy the right to own property and establish private businesses. Economic instability, cumbersome regulations, and corruption affect the private sector at all levels.Approximately 70 percent of the country’s rural Indigenous communities lack titles to their lands, and forced evictions, while technically illegal, still occur. Indigenous communities continue to struggle to defend their land rights and reclaim traditional lands.",3,"Argentinians enjoy broad freedom regarding marriage and divorce. Same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples were legalized in 2010. A 2012 gender-identity law allows people to legally change their gender.Gender-based violence remains a serious problem. The ombudsperson’s office reported 242 femicides in 2022. Abortion was legalized up to the 14th week of pregnancy in 2020, a landmark decision in Latin America.",4,"Argentina faces high poverty rates aggravated by high inflation. In the first half of 2022, the poverty rate was 36.5 percent, with 8.8 percent of people living in extreme poverty.Forced labor is high in sectors such as garment and brick production, agriculture, and domestic work. At least half of the workforce is informally employed and lacks labor rights and legal protections. Sex trafficking is a serious concern, and efforts to combat it have been hindered by corruption and the complicity of some officials, according to the US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report.",3
armenia,"The law protects freedom of movement and the rights of individuals to change their place of residence, employment, and education. In practice, access to higher education is somewhat hampered by a culture of bribery. Effects of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh have continued into 2022, continuing to constrain freedom of movement along some border areas. After the November 2020 ceasefire, Azerbaijani forces took control over a 21-kilometer (13-mile) stretch of the Goris-Kapan highway, the only major road connecting the Syunik region to the rest of Armenia, partitioning villages and affecting residents’ ability to move freely. In November 2021, Azerbaijani forces built new checkpoints along the road. Azerbaijani forces continued to occupy Armenian territory in 2022 and have frequently acted to impede the internal movement of Armenian residents, using threat of force against civilians to exert control. In September, Azerbaijani forces launched another military offensive, killing hundreds of soldiers and three civilians, and destroying infrastructure in the Syunik region.",2,"Armenian law adequately protects property rights, though officials have not always upheld them in the past. Economic diversification and simpler regulations have increased the ease of doing business in recent years, but a lack of transparency and persistent cronyism created unfair advantages for those with ties to public officials during the HHK government’s tenure. However, much of this has subsided since the 2018 change in government. Numerous incidents of burning pastures and farms, as well as theft of cattle, were reported after the escalation of the militarized conflict and the entry of Azerbaijani troops into Armenia in September 2022.",3,"The constitution defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Domestic violence is common and not adequately prosecuted, and services for victims are inadequate. A new law on domestic violence that took effect in 2018 placed an emphasis on “restoring family harmony,” raising concerns that it would deter victims from leaving dangerous situations. In 2019, the government introduced amendments to remove that reference and expand the definition of what constituted domestic violence. In early January 2020, a women’s rights activist reported that police became more responsive to domestic violence cases after the law’s introduction.The HHK government signed the Istanbul Convention, a Council of Europe (CoE) document that binds participating countries to bolster their efforts to combat violence against women, in 2018. While the government has not yet ratified the Istanbul Convention, the parliament did approve the ratification of the Lanzarote Convention, a CoE document that requires signatories to address sexual violence against children, in May 2020. The July 2022 criminal code includes more significant protections for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV).",2,"Legal protections against exploitative or dangerous working conditions are poorly enforced, and about half of workers are employed in the informal sector, where they may be more exposed to such conditions. Armenians are subjected to sex and labor trafficking abroad, and some children in the country work in agriculture and other sectors. Children residing in care institutions face a particularly heightened risk of trafficking. According to the US State Department, the government does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so.",2
australia,"The government respects freedom of movement, and neither state nor nonstate actors interfere with the choice of residence, employment, or institution of higher education.In response to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and 2021, some state and territory governments periodically closed their internal borders. The process to obtain an exemption for traveling between states was difficult and often significantly delayed. Some people who rely on services including employment or health care across state borders were unable to access these services due to the closures. Some states closed their borders with little notice, and some jurisdictions with lower rates of COVID-19 transmission, particularly Queensland and Western Australia, maintained a hardline stance on internal borders throughout 2021, despite low transmission rates of the virus and high vaccination rates. Queensland reopened its borders to interstate and international travelers in January 2022, and Western Australia followed suit in March, and since then, no state or territory has reimposed pandemic-related border closures in response to the pandemic.",4,"With an open and free market economy, businesses and individuals enjoy a high level of economic freedom and strong protections for property rights.",4,"The government generally does not restrict social freedoms. In 2017, Parliament legalized same-sex marriage following a nationwide, nonbinding postal survey in which more than 60 percent of participants favored legalization. Same-sex couples have also won the right to adopt children at the state level, with the Northern Territory becoming the last state or territory to legalize LGBT+ adoption in 2018. Discrimination based on gender identity was prohibited under a 2013 amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984.Gender-based violence (GBV) remains a national concern, particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. In addition, women who kill domestic abusers in self-defense are often jailed, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women representing the majority of this incarcerated group. In November 2022, the New South Wales state parliament passed a law criminalizing coercive control in intimate partner relationships, with penalties of up to seven years in prison. Abortion law is decided by state and territory governments. New South Wales was the last state to decriminalize abortion in 2019. In some states there is no access to abortion through public health systems despite its legality, forcing people in those areas to seek assistance from private providers.",4,"Australians generally enjoy robust economic opportunities and freedom from exploitation. However, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continue to face economic hardship; census data from 2016 revealed that employment rates in remote areas declined since 2006, impeding their upward social mobility. In 2018, Parliament passed the Modern Slavery Act, requiring large businesses to be more transparent about potential slavery in their supply chains and to make efforts to address the problem. While the law has been largely viewed favorably, some critics have noted that it fails to impose penalties for noncompliance.",3
austria,"Austrian citizens generally enjoy freedom of movement. However, restrictions were periodically imposed between March 2020 and March 2022 to curb the spread of COVID-19.Roma and other ethnic minorities face discrimination in the labor and housing markets. The Labor Ministry has sought to promote integration of younger immigrants by providing German-language courses and job training.",4,Austrians may freely exercise the right to own property and establish businesses.,4,"Same-sex marriage became legal in Austria in 2019. Restrictions on same-sex couples adopting children ended in 2016.The 2009 Second Protection Against Violence Act increased penalties for perpetrators of domestic violence and authorized further punitive measures against chronic offenders. However, gender-based violence remains a problem; Austria has one of the highest rates of femicide in the EU.",4,"A 1979 law guarantees women’s freedom from discrimination in various areas, including the workplace.In June 2022, Austrian police announced that an antitrafficking investigation had uncovered a large-scale labor trafficking operation in which more than 230 Iraqi asylum seekers had been forced to work in illegal conditions and subjected to systematic wage theft.",3
azerbaijan,"The government restricts freedom of movement, particularly foreign travel, for opposition politicians, journalists, and civil society activists. While travel bans were lifted for some dissidents during 2019, many others remained in place, including for some of the political prisoners released that year; others fled the country to avoid further persecution. Some travel bans remained in effect in 2022 and were extended to the families of political emigrants.IDPs from the previous Nagorno-Karabakh conflict enjoy freedom of movement in law, but not in practice. IDPs are legally registered at their place of initial resettlement, which are sometimes in rural areas and far from any source of employment. The process of changing registration is difficult, and IDPs who change their place of registration risk losing their status and accompanying state assistance. As a result, many families are separated, with usually male wage-earners relocating to urban centers for work while their families remain at their place of registration. In 2021, President Aliyev established the Karabakh Revival Fund, which is meant to finance infrastructure development in Nagorno-Karabakh to allow IDPs to return there. During 2022, several families who had been displaced in the 1990s were resettled on the territory taken by Azerbaijan following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.Most of Azerbaijan’s land borders remained closed into 2022, ostensibly for COVID-19-related reasons. Following the Russian military invasion of Ukraine in February, flights between Russia and Azerbaijan were suspended, which, combined with the land border closures, left many Azerbaijanis living in Russia unable to return to Azerbaijan during the year.People with disabilities and psychiatric patients are routinely institutionalized; there is no clear procedure to review their confinement.",1,"Property rights are affected by government-backed development projects that often entail forced evictions, unlawful expropriations, and demolitions with little or no notice. Corruption and the economic dominance of state-owned companies and politically connected elites pose obstacles to ordinary private business activity.",1,"The law generally grants women and men the same rights on personal status matters such as marriage, divorce, and child custody. Domestic violence is a notable problem, and related legal protections are inadequate. Conservative social norms contribute to the widespread view that domestic violence is a private matter, which discourages victims from reporting perpetrators to the police. However, the growth of social media and the movement of rural populations to Baku in recent years have spurred public discussion of the issue. Gender-based violence is a persistent problem. Sexual assaults frequently go unreported, and those that are reported often are not prosecuted.In 2021, new legislation imposing mandatory mediation on those seeking to divorce came into force. The law introduces a number of obstacles for those wishing to divorce, especially for people outside of large cities who may not have access to official mediation services. Critics say that the law will disproportionately disadvantage people who cannot secure legal representation or those who are otherwise vulnerable, such as survivors of domestic abuse attempting to divorce their abuser.",1,"Legal safeguards against exploitative working conditions are poorly enforced, and many employers reportedly ignore them without penalty. Children are vulnerable to sexual exploitation and forced labor.The government has taken some steps to combat forced labor and sex trafficking, including by prosecuting traffickers and providing services to victims, but the problem persists, notably among Romany children and foreign household workers. The authorities extended a preexisting moratorium on labor inspections through the end of 2021.As a result of corruption and a lack of public accountability for the allocation of resources, the state’s oil and gas revenues tend to benefit privileged elites rather than the general population, narrowing access to economic opportunity.",1
bahamas,"The freedom of movement is protected. Migrants and Haitian-Bahamians’ ability to move freely is affected by their lack of Bahamian identity documents, however.Roadblocks have been erected as part of immigration enforcement actions.",3,"The country has a strong private sector, and the economy relies mostly on tourism and financial services. Individuals are free to establish businesses.The government has worked to dismantle shantytowns in recent years. In 2021, a Supreme Court judge expanded an existing injunction to prohibit the dismantlement of any unregulated community in Abaco. In October 2022, Attorney General Pinder said the government was preparing contempt proceedings over structures that were erected in Abaco in apparent violation of that injunction. That same month, the Spanish Wells Commonage Committee announced a one-year construction ban in the Blackwood shantytown.",4,"The government does not place explicit restrictions on social freedoms. However, the constitution distinguishes between Bahamian men and women in the transmission of citizenship to a spouse or child, resulting in distinctions in treatment of married Bahamian women’s children and their foreign-born husbands.In a 2020 ruling, the Supreme Court affirmed the granting of Bahamian citizenship to a Bahamian-born child regardless of the gender or marital status of their Bahamian parent. The Court of Appeal upheld that ruling in 2021. The former FNM government vowed to appeal to the Privy Council. In August 2022, Pinder said the incumbent PLP government would legislate to allow men and women to pass citizenship onto children. Violence against women, including domestic violence and marital rape, is a serious issue. Same-sex marriage is not legalized.",3,"The Bahamas is a source, destination, and transit country for forced labor and sexual exploitation. According to the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report 2022, the government made significant efforts to address trafficking. Migrant workers, many of whom arrive in The Bahamas to work in the agricultural sector and in domestic services, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation.",3
bahrain,"Authorities sometimes restrict movement inside the country to prevent protests by residents of largely Shiite villages outside Manama. The government also obstructs foreign travel by numerous opposition figures and activists.

Bahrain established a “flexible” permit for foreign workers in 2017, aiming to ease the workers’ ability to change jobs; the traditional sponsorship (kafala) system ties migrant workers to a specific employer. However, participation in the newer scheme has been limited by numerical caps and other restrictions.",1,"Although registered businesses are largely free to operate, obtaining approval can be difficult in practice. For the wealthy elites who dominate the business sector, property rights are generally respected, and expropriation is rare. Shiite citizens encounter difficulties obtaining affordable housing and in some cases face de facto bans on purchasing land. Much of the country’s scarce land is occupied by royal properties and military facilities. Noncitizens can only own property in designated areas. Women may inherit property, but their rights are not equal to those of men.",2,"Personal status issues such as marriage, divorce, and child custody are governed by a 2017 unified family law applying to both Sunni and Shiite Muslim families. The law’s provisions are based on Sharia (Islamic law) principles that put women at a disadvantage on many topics. Unlike men, Bahraini women who marry non-Bahrainis cannot pass their citizenship to their children.

Accused rapists can avoid punishment by marrying their victims, and spousal rape is not specifically outlawed. Adultery is illegal, and those who kill a spouse caught in the act of adultery are eligible for lenience in sentencing.",2,"Migrant workers, who make up a large portion of the population, are sometimes subjected to forced labor or have their salaries and passports withheld, although this is illegal. Due to their employment and living conditions, migrant workers have faced a disproportionate risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19, and those who lost their jobs amid the pandemic often faced eviction, denial of services, or deportation. Migrant workers also received fewer emergency benefits than citizens.

The US State Department found in its 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report that the government had made serious efforts to address human trafficking, highlighting the creation of a specialized prosecutor’s office and court. The report also noted that no traffickers were convicted during its coverage period, however, and recommended increased efforts to investigate and convict traffickers.

Revenues from oil and gas exports are used to fund public employment and services that benefit all citizens, but access to public-sector jobs and promotion opportunities often depends on one’s social and sectarian background and personal connections.",1

There are few legal restrictions regarding choice of education or employment.",3,"Property rights are unevenly enforced, and the ability to engage freely in private economic activity is somewhat constrained. Corruption and bribery, inadequate infrastructure, and official bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles hinder business activities throughout the country. State involvement and interference in the economy is considerable. The 2011 Vested Properties Return Act allows Hindus to reclaim land that the government or other individuals seized, but it has been unevenly implemented. Tribal minorities have little control over land decisions affecting them, and Bengali-speaking settlers continue to illegally encroach on tribal lands in the CHT.",2,"Under personal status laws affecting all religions, women have fewer marriage, divorce, and inheritance rights than men, and face discrimination in social services and employment. Rape, acid throwing, and other forms of gender-based violence occur regularly despite laws offering some level of protection. As many as 70 percent of married women are abused by their intimate partners but rarely report those incidents. Domestic violence survivors receive little assistance from government-run shelters or support programs. In 2020, the government introduced the death penalty for rape in response to large protests after a series of high-profile incidents of rape and sexual assault.Giving or receiving dowry is a criminal offense, but coercive requests still occur. Bangladesh has one of the world’s highest rates of child marriage. Despite a stated government commitment in 2014 to abolish the practice by 2041, parliamentarians approved a law that would permit girls under the age of 18 to marry under certain circumstances in 2017, reversing a previous legal ban on the practice.",2,"Socioeconomic inequality is widespread. Working conditions in the garment industry remain extremely unsafe in most factories despite the renewal of a legally binding accord between unions and clothing brands to improve safety practices. Comprehensive reforms of the industry are hampered by the fact that a growing number of factory owners are also legislators or influential businesspeople.Bangladesh remains both a major supplier of and transit point for trafficking victims. Women and children are trafficked both overseas and within the country for the purposes of domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, while men are trafficked primarily for labor abroad. In the 2022 edition of its Trafficking in Persons Report, the US State Department noted that antitrafficking tribunals resumed operating in 2021 but said that the government had lowered its protection efforts during the reporting period. A comprehensive 2013 antitrafficking law provides protection to victims and increased penalties for traffickers, but enforcement remains inadequate.",2

A written ruling was to be released in January 2023.",3,"Residents generally have access to economic opportunity, and the law provides some protections against exploitative labor practices. However, unions have criticized opaque employment practices in the hospitality industry.The government continues to crack down on human trafficking; in the 2022 edition of its Trafficking in Persons Report, the US State Department reported that authorities launched the first trafficking-related prosecutions since 2013. However, no successful convictions have been recorded since the 2016 Trafficking in Persons Prevention Act came into force.",4
belarus,"Opposition activists are occasionally detained at the border for lengthy searches. Passports are used as a primary identity document in Belarus, and authorities are known to harass people living in a different location than indicated by domestic stamps in their passport. Routine citizenship and documentation services abroad have been restricted, resulting in severe delays or denial of service for people who fled the country for political reasons. On numerous occasions, authorities have forced the expulsion of politically active Belarusians since 2020, including Tsikhanouskaya and Catholic archbishop Kondrusiewicz. That December, authorities prohibited Belarusians from leaving the country at land border crossings, except with Russia, ostensibly to prevent the spread of COVID-19; the policy was likely enforced to prevent political dissidents from fleeing. In May 2021, the EU banned Belarusian airlines from traveling over its airspace and accessing its airports. This has limited travel options for Belarusian citizens and significantly increased the cost of leaving the country. Further restrictions on air travel were imposed in response to the border crisis instigated by the Belarusian authorities.",1,"Though limits on economic freedom have eased in recent years, state interference still affects the economy and profitable business owners are never secure from arbitrary government pressure and harassment. Many businesspeople that became involved in the postelection prodemocracy efforts, often to support victims of human rights abuses or to incentivize policemen to resign from law enforcement, were criminally prosecuted on groundless claims. Other businesses and their owners who supported candidates other than Lukashenka have been arrested under false pretense. Multiple businesses relocated their employees to neighboring countries for fear of state harassment or prosecution.In October 2022, Lukashenka announced price regulation measures for 370 consumer goods. At least one chain store was heavily fined and more than 40 people were detained for unsanctioned price increases before year’s end; in one case, a business owner received a suspended sentence of to up to two years in prison for “abuse of office.”",1,"Domestic violence is a pervasive problem in Belarus, and police register about 150,000 incidents per year. In 2018, Lukashenka blocked a draft law on the prevention of domestic violence jointly developed by law enforcement agencies and civil society representatives, calling attitudes against the corporal punishment of children “nonsense from the West.” Threats of losing custody of children are often used to intimidate and harass political activists.The constitution explicitly bans same-sex marriage. Constitutional amendments made in 2022 define marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman. The amendments further declare that marriage, motherhood, and fatherhood are protected by the state, creating further obstacles for same-sex partners to obtain legal recognition and to plan their family life. The Belarusian government led a 2016 effort to block LGBT+ rights from being part of a UN international initiative focused on urban areas.",2,"Mandatory unpaid national workdays, postgraduate employment allocation, compulsory labor for inmates in state rehabilitation facilities, and restrictions on leaving employment in certain industries have led labor activists to conclude that all Belarusian citizens experience forced labor at some stage of their life.

Child marriage and forced marriage remain common in rural areas.",2,"Legal protections against forced labor and other exploitative working conditions are unevenly enforced. Poor conditions are prevalent in the large informal sector, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Human trafficking is widespread, despite increased convictions for the crime in recent years.

Spousal rape is not considered a crime. Customary law restricts women’s rights within a marriage. When husbands and wives separate, custody of any children is traditionally granted to the father. Child and forced marriages still occur under customary law. Perpetrators are rarely prosecuted. Women can experience harassment for not dressing conservatively.In 2018, Parliament passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill, which introduced stronger penalties for rape and raised the age of consent from 16 to 18. Subsequent amendments introduced longer sentences for rape and provide compensation for victims. Women’s rights activists expressed concern over certain aspects of the reforms, including the criminalizing of false rape allegations. Other interventions include a sex offenders registry, a toll-free line for victims of gender-based violence, an interministerial committee on gender-based violence, and 25 courts dedicated to gender-based violence cases.Same-sex relations have been decriminalized, but there is no legislation yet that legalizes same-sex unions.",2,"Workers enjoy protections against exploitative labor practices.

Corruption and organized crime can pose obstacles to private business activity.",3,"The government generally does not restrict social freedoms. Same-sex marriage became legal in 2013. Gender-based violence remains widespread, though legislation has been introduced to combat it. A 2006 law sought to address high rates of impunity for domestic violence. Law 14.188 amended the penal code to criminalize simple bodily harm due to gender and criminalize psychological violence against women.Abortion is legal only in the case of rape, a threat to the mother’s life, or a rare and usually fatal brain deformity in the fetus. However, women and young girls are denied their legal right to abortion due to discretionary acts from the bureaucracy and judicial system. As many as one million Brazilians seek abortions through clandestine means annually, including by traveling abroad.",3,"Slavery-like working conditions pose a significant problem in rural and urban zones. A 2012 constitutional amendment allows the government to confiscate all property of landholders found to be using slave labor, a measure Bolsonaro criticized. Deeply entrenched patterns of discrimination, including precarious informal employment, contributed to Afro-Brazilians suffering high COVID-19-related mortality rates.COVID-19 and inflation have exacerbated inequality in Brazil.

In the past, rights groups have noted that Bangladeshi workers are subject to awful and inhumane conditions in Brunei. Workers who were promised salaried jobs upon arrival have found no employment, and employers have seized workers’ passports to prevent them from accessing services and from leaving for another job.

However, Bulgaria does not recognize same-sex marriages or same-sex unions, nor does it allow same-sex couples to adopt or register as parents of a child. The European Court of Justice in late 2021 ruled that a lesbian couple’s daughter—born in Spain in 2019 to a Bulgarian national and a British national but considered stateless herself—must be issued a Bulgarian passport, raising hopes that this issue would be finally resolved in Bulgaria.Domestic violence remains a problem. People who have experienced domestic violence and NGOs addressing gender-based violence claim that state authorities are often ineffective in providing protection and pursuing criminal charges when abuse is reported.",3,"Labor laws provide basic protections against exploitative working conditions, but they do not extend in practice to gray-market employment. Roma and other ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for sexual and labor exploitation. Although the government has continued to step up efforts to combat trafficking, shelter victims, and punish perpetrators, these measures have not matched the scale of the problem, and punishments remain light in practice.",2

china,"Prior to the sudden abandonment of the strict zero-COVID policies in late November 2022, following widespread protests, lockdowns in dozens of cities across the country restricted people’s movement, and in some cases confining them to their homes or to quarantine centers. The COVID-19 “health code” app, which was in use until late 2022, was reportedly used to restrict peoples’ access to air and train travel, medical facilities, and a range of public services and spaces based on arbitrary or opaque criteria. Some individuals reported that they were prevented from attending protests after their health code app suddenly turned from green to red while they were en route to the event, pointing to the government’s use of the app to restrict the movements of specific individuals.While China’s constitution gives individuals the right to petition the government concerning a grievance or injustice, in practice petitioners are routinely intercepted in their efforts to travel to government centers, forcibly returned to their hometowns, or extralegally detained.Despite the government’s stated commitment to reforming the hukou (household registration) system, it continues to prevent close to 300 million internal migrants from enjoying full legal rights as residents in the cities where they work.Police checkpoints throughout Xinjiang limit residents’ ability to travel or even leave their hometowns.Millions of people are affected by government restrictions on their access to foreign travel and passports, with Uyghurs and Tibetans experiencing the greatest difficulty.

An ongoing government crackdown on private businesses, particularly large technology and social media firms, has ostensibly been aimed at curbing monopolistic practices, uncontrolled growth, and other economic ills, but has also brought the private sector more firmly under CCP control. Running a business continues to expose individuals to prosecution and long prison terms. Chinese-Canadian Xiao Jianhua, one of China’s richest businessmen, was sentenced to 13 years in prison on bribery and other charges in August 2022, five years after his abduction from a Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong. Tomorrow Holdings, the investment group he had founded, had been linked to family members of prominent former officials.Property rights protection remains weak. Urban land is owned by the state, with only the buildings themselves in private hands. Rural land is collectively owned by villages. Farmers enjoy long-term lease rights to the land they work, but they have been restricted in their ability to transfer, sell, or develop it. Low compensation and weak legal protections have facilitated land seizures by local officials, who often evict residents and transfer the land rights to developers. Corruption is endemic in such projects, and local governments rely on land development as a crucial source of revenue.",1,"Following regulatory changes in 2021 allowing couples to have up to three children, out of concern over falling fertility rates, the government in 2022 launched a new campaign instructing local family planning officials to limit the number of abortions, including by discouraging abortions for “nonmedical” reasons. The move was interpreted as a further effort to boost the country’s declining fertility rate. While ethnic minority couples were already permitted to have up to three children prior to 2021, in practice ethnic Tibetans as well as Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang are subject to abusive policies aimed at limiting their reproduction. Domestic violence continues to affect one-quarter of Chinese women, according to official figures, despite laws criminalizing the behavior. The law does not criminalize spousal rape.Chinese law defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman, denying marriage rights to same-sex couples. Muslims in Xinjiang face restrictions and penalties related to aspects of their appearance with religious connotations, such as headscarves on women or beards on men.",2,"While workers in China are afforded important protections under existing laws, violations of labor and employment regulations are widespread. Exploitative employment practices such as wage theft, excessive overtime, student labor, and unsafe working conditions are pervasive in many industries. Forced labor and human trafficking are common, affecting internal migrants as well as Chinese nationals who are trafficked abroad. Forced labor is the norm in prisons and other detention facilities.",2
colombia,"Freedom of movement improved substantially in tandem with the peace process, but it remains restricted by ongoing violence in certain regions, particularly for marginalized people. More than 35,000 individuals were displaced during the first six months of 2022, mostly due to threats from armed groups. Travel in some remote areas is further limited by illegal checkpoints operated by criminal and guerrilla groups. Most COVID-19-related restrictions on movement ended in 2022, but incoming international travelers were still required to be vaccinated or provide a negative coronavirus test before entering the country.As of July 2022, more than one million Venezuelan migrants have been granted Temporary Protection Status (ETPV), allowing them to work and move freely in Colombia for 10 years. Permit-holders are eligible for a range of state-run programs and services, including healthcare and education.",3,"Violence and instability in some areas threaten property rights and the ability to establish businesses. Guerrillas, paramilitary successor groups, and common criminals regularly extort payments from business owners. Corruption as well as undue pressure exerted on prosecutors and members of the judiciary can disrupt legitimate business activity.Progress remains slow on the implementation of the landmark 2011 Victims and Land Law, which recognized the legitimacy of claims by victims of conflict-related abuses, including those committed by government forces. While affected citizens continue receiving compensation and modest progress has been made on land titling, the legal process for land restitution is heavily backlogged, and the resettlement of those who were displaced during the conflict moved slowly during the Duque administration, which demonstrated limited will to advance the process. In 2022, the newly elected Petro administration promised to accelerate the process, and in October, the government agreed to a series of land purchases, which will be distributed at a subsidized price to those displaced by the conflict.",2,"Personal social freedoms, such as those related to marriage and divorce, are largely respected. In 2016, after several years of contradictory judicial and administrative decisions regarding same-sex unions, the Constitutional Court voted to legalize them.In February 2022, the Constitutional Court decriminalized all abortions performed within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Prior to this, women continued to face criminal charges for abortion.",4,"Child labor, the recruitment of children by illegal armed groups, and related sexual abuse are serious problems in Colombia; recruitment declined following the peace accord but has increased since 2020 amid pandemic-related disruption and violence. A 2011 free trade agreement with the United States and a subsequent Labor Action Plan called for enhanced investigation of abusive labor practices and rights violations, but progress remains deficient in several areas. In coca-growing zones, armed groups exert coercive pressure on farmers to engage in coca cultivation and shun government-run crop-substitution programs.",2

While these rights are generally respected in practice, poverty frequently prevents travel between the islands as well as access to higher education.The authorities introduced COVID-19-related movement restrictions in March 2020, suspending travel to the French territories of Mayotte and Réunion. An overnight curfew was imposed in February 2021 and remained in effect until June 2022.",2,"In accordance with civil and some customary laws, women have equal rights in inheritance matters. Local cultures on Grande Comore and Mohéli are matrilineal, with women legally possessing all inheritable property. However, this is complicated by the concurrent application of Sharia, interpretations of which can limit gender equality. In addition, a poor land-registration system and women’s difficulties in securing loans hampers their right to own land.Endemic corruption and a lack of transparency hampers normal business activity.",2,"Early and forced marriages have been reported in Comoros.

Many young people struggle to find sustainable opportunities for employment. Poverty has driven many people to attempt the dangerous trip to Mayotte.Government efforts to identify and prosecute human trafficking are minimal, and trafficking cases, if addressed, are often done so through informal mediation processes. These mechanisms have sometimes facilitated the return of trafficking victims to traffickers.

In 2019, then president Alvarado signed a technical decree to facilitate limited access to abortion, though conditions remain restrictive.",3,"Despite legal protections, domestic workers are subject to exploitation and forced labor. Employers often ignore minimum wage and social security laws, and fines for violations are insignificant. Child labor is a problem in the informal economy. Sex trafficking and child sex tourism are serious problems. The US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report highlighted the government’s “significant efforts” to combat trafficking, including implementing a national antitrafficking action plan.

Women are generally afforded equal freedom of movement, though risks of insecurity and sexual violence hinder this in practice.",2,"Citizens have the right to own and establish private businesses, and the country has attracted significant investment since 2011. However, property and land rights remain weak, especially in the west, where conflict over land tenure remains a significant source of tension.

Migrants may be discriminated over land issues even though they have legal documents of their property title.",2,"Women suffer significant legal and economic discrimination, and sexual and gender-based violence are widespread. According to a 2019 survey carried out by Citizens for the Promotion and Defense of the Rights of Children, Women and Minorities (CPDEFM), an Ivorian NGO, more than 70 percent of women in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire’s largest city, have been victims of domestic violence. Legal protections from gender-based violence are weak and are often ignored. Impunity for perpetrators also remains a problem, and when it is prosecuted, rape is routinely reclassified as indecent assault. Costly medical certificates are often essential for convictions yet are beyond the means of victims who are impoverished.Child marriage is historically widespread, though the 2019 marriage law set the minimum age for marriage at 18 for both sexes. Customary and religious marriages, more common outside urban areas, were not affected by the law. The law also banned same-sex marriage.",1,"Despite efforts by the government and international industries in recent years to counter the phenomenon, child labor is a frequent problem, particularly in the cocoa industry. Human trafficking is prohibited by the constitution, but government programs for victims of trafficking—often children—are inadequate.In the 2022 edition of its Trafficking in Persons Report, the US State Department reported that the government was successfully convicting more traffickers and identifying more victims, but also reported that victims receive insufficient shelter or services.",2

However, corruption can inhibit normal business operations.",3,"In 2014, following a 2013 referendum that banned same-sex marriage, the parliament passed a law allowing same-sex civil unions. The law affords same-sex couples equal rights in inheritance, social benefits, and taxation. In April 2021, an administrative court in Zagreb ruled that same-sex couples have the right to adopt children. The ruling was confirmed by a higher court in May 2022. Domestic violence remains a concern. Convictions for rape and domestic violence can bring lengthy prison terms, although Amnesty International noted that the vast majority of cases receive sentences of one year or less. Police sometimes fail to adhere to recommended procedures for handling domestic violence reports.In 2018, lawmakers ratified the Istanbul Convention, a treaty on preventing and combating gender-based and domestic violence. The treaty was unpopular among conservative and far-right groups who believed its tenets could lead to the legal introduction of same-sex marriage, a third gender category, or school curriculum changes. In response, the government offered a statement saying the treaty’s adoption would not change the legal definition of marriage. Amnesty International criticized the Croatian government for failing to harmonize its legislative and policy framework with the treaty’s terms. Abortion is legal, but is restricted to cases of rape, incest, or serious health problems for the pregnant person or fetus after 10 weeks. Croatian doctors face pressure to refrain from performing the procedure. In May 2022, a Croatian woman whose fetus was diagnosed with an aggressive tumor was only able to receive an abortion after a medical commission ruled in her favor. Four hospitals had declined to assist the woman, who was advised to travel to Slovenia.",3,"Worker protection laws are robust, and the Office of the Labor Inspectorate actively investigates work sites.

The number of people leaving Cuba—including those barred from traveling abroad, known as regulados—has risen sharply since the July 2021 protests, with estimates exceeding 140,000 Cuban immigrants and asylum seekers attempting to enter the United States between October 2021 and July 2022 alone.",1,"The 2019 constitution recognized private property as one form of ownership, though opportunities to obtain property and operate private enterprises remain restricted. In June 2021, the government announced that it would allow the formation of small and medium-sized enterprises but would limit their activities to sectors that are not deemed strategic. Restrictions on self-employed workers remained under the government’s updated private-enterprise policy, however.

denmark,"Freedom of movement is protected by law and generally respected by the government. However, in 2018, the government, then headed by Lars Løkke Rasmussen, proposed an “antighetto” initiative, applicable to neighborhoods identified as having high unemployment and crime rates as well as a high percentage of residents designated to have “non-Western” origins. In June 2021, Parliament made changes to the regulations, expanding their reach to new neighborhoods. The revision, which replaces the term “ghetto” with “parallel society,” imposes tenancy restrictions based on education, income, ethnicity, and criminal record. In November 2022, the Danish Eastern High Court referred a case brought on behalf of a group of Danish residents affected by the initiatives to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The court will rule on whether the “antighetto” policies—particularly the tenancy quotas based on “non-Western” background—violate the European Union (EU) Race Equality Directive.Since 2015, Denmark has enacted measures that restrict the movement of people who seek to join, or have joined, extremist groups abroad—notably the IS. Some of the measures have been criticized for having a low evidentiary threshold or for lacking appropriate oversight mechanisms.

Female students with children often leave school, sometimes under pressure from their principals. Gender-based violence, including domestic violence, sexual violence, and femicide, is also common. El Salvador has one of Latin America’s highest femicide rates.",2,"El Salvador remains a source, transit, and destination country for the trafficking of women, children, and LGBT+ people. There are instances of forced labor in the construction and informal sectors. According to the 2022 edition of the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report, there has been an increase in convictions of traffickers and 2019 legislation granted temporary residency rights to trafficking survivors, although none received “residency benefits” during the reporting period. However, the government reduced resources allocated for the antitrafficking prosecution team, and shelter and public services for survivors remain insufficient.Children are vulnerable to economic exploitation, and child labor is a serious problem. Children perform dangerous jobs in agriculture and are recruited by gangs and other criminal elements to carry out illegal activities.",2

Equatorial Guinea continues to score poorly on social and economic development indicators, and economic conditions have worsened when global oil prices are low.Some foreign workers are subject to passport confiscation and forced labor. Corrupt officials are often complicit in human trafficking, according to the US State Department.

ethiopia,"While the constitution establishes freedom of movement, local conflicts impede people’s ability to travel freely. Travel to Tigray, several parts of Oromia, and other parts of Ethiopia have been severely impeded due to the violent conflicts. The intentional destruction of infrastructure such as roads and bridges by armed actors has also undermined civilian and humanitarian movement.Though the government and the Tigray administration agreed to end hostilities in November 2022, the conflict impeded people’s movement in the region throughout the year.Violent conflict and security clampdowns in Amhara, Afar, Oromia, and Benishangul Gumuz have also significantly reduced internal travel, with most Ethiopians feeling safer in their home region than in other states.",0,"Private business opportunities are limited by heavy government regulation of key industries and the dominance of state-owned enterprises in many sectors.

A gender gap persists in many aspects of economic life including land ownership and access to finance.The conflicts have hindered people’s ability to exercise their right to own property and private businesses. The ICHREE’s 2022 report documented widespread looting and destruction of properties by government forces, its allied forces—including Eritrean forces—and Tigrayan forces in Tigray, Amhara, and Afar, as a result of the war in Tigray. The rising number of attacks targeting ethnic groups committed by armed militants resulted in the destruction and looting of properties in Benishangul Gumuz, Amhara, SNNP, Oromia, and other regions.",1,"Legislation protects women’s rights, but these rights are routinely violated in practice. Enforcement of laws against rape and domestic abuse is inconsistent, and cases routinely stall in the courts. Particularly in conflict-affected areas, people have barely any legal protections in practice. The government and its allied forces have been implicated in committing widespread acts of rape and sexual violence against Tigrayan women and girls, with the particular goal of rendering them infertile.Forced child marriage is illegal but common in Ethiopia, and prosecutions for the crime are rare. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is also illegal, but the law is inconsistently enforced. In Tigray, the conflict and the humanitarian crisis have resulted in an increase of instances of child marriage, child labor, human trafficking, and coerced sex. Civilians in Tigray have been sex trafficked by the ENDF, its regional allied forces, and Eritrean forces.LGBT+ people do not have social freedoms and do not publicly identify themselves, for fear of violent retaliation.

In early 2022, Prime Minister Marin said that the government would vote on a bill to overturn these requirements later in the year, and in September the government submitted a proposal for an act addressing the legal recognition of gender.Legislation permitting in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination was enacted in 2007, but surrogacy remains illegal for both opposite and same-sex couples.The government submitted a proposal to reform the section of the criminal code that addresses sexual offenses to define rape as a nonconsensual act and it was adopted by the parliament in June 2022. However, there are complaints that sexual offenses are not properly investigated by the police. Rates of violence against women remain high. There are not substantial frameworks or procedures to address domestic violence, nor long-term support for survivors. A March 2022 Amnesty International report found that less than half of all municipalities have gender-based violence prevention programs.",4,"The authorities generally uphold protections against exploitative working conditions. Asylum seekers and migrants are most vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking. The government actively prosecutes trafficking offenses, and survivors have access to protection and assistance.

Those working in the informal sector and extractive industries in the country’s interior are particularly vulnerable to abuses.,2
haiti,"The government generally does not restrict travel or place limits on the ability to change one’s place of employment or education. However, insecurity has prevented free movement, particularly in Port-au-Prince, as roads are frequently blockaded by criminal groups, police, or protesters, and many residents avoid unnecessary travel due to widespread gang violence. Movement was further restricted by roadblocks, protests, and the occupation of the country’s main fuel terminal after the government announced a fuel-subsidy reduction in September 2022.The International Organization of Migration counted 113,000 internally displaced people as of August 2022, most of whom fled the capital due to gang violence. Many displaced Haitians live in especially poor conditions.",1,"Although the legal framework protects property rights and private business activity, it is difficult in practice to register property, enforce contracts, and obtain credit. Poor record-keeping and corruption contribute to inconsistent enforcement of property rights.Business owners faced more intensive extortion efforts on the part of criminal gangs in 2022. Criminal gangs are also known to demand bribes or other support from officials. NGOs, meanwhile, have had to negotiate with criminal groups for access to territory; criminal groups have additionally pressured NGOs into providing financial assistance or hiring their members.",1,"Basic freedoms related to marriage, divorce, and custody are generally respected. However, there are no laws specifically addressing domestic violence, which is a widespread problem. Both domestic violence and rape are underreported and rarely result in successful prosecutions, with justice officials often favoring reconciliation or other forms of settlement. Spousal rape is not recognized as a criminal offense. Sexual violence has also become more common due to gang activity. According to an August 2022 report, the RNDDH learned of at least 52 women and girls who were raped as gangs fought for control of Nan Brooklyn in July. In its October report, the BINUH said that gangs were engaging in sexual violence as a means of subjugation.The reformed penal code that was set to take effect in June 2022 would decriminalize abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a threat to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman. Abortion was prohibited entirely under existing law. The reformed code would also lower the age of consent to 15. The government postponed the implementation of the code in June, largely due to negative public reaction but also due to a lack of follow-through on its own part.",2,"Socioeconomic mobility is obstructed by entrenched poverty and inequality. Legal protections against exploitative working conditions in formal employment are weakly enforced, and most workers are informally employed. After workers protested for better pay, the government introduced new minimum wages for three wage classes in February 2022.As many as 300,000 children work as domestic servants, often without pay or access to education; they are especially vulnerable to physical or sexual abuse. Other forms of child labor are common. To escape dire social and economic conditions at home, many Haitians have risked human trafficking and dangerous land and sea journeys to reach countries including The Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and the United States.",0
honduras,"Ongoing violence and impunity have reduced personal autonomy and freedom of movement in Honduras. Those living in gang-controlled territories face extortion, and dangerous conditions limit free movement and options for education and employment. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees calculated that over 247,000 people were internally displaced at the end of 2021, while 23,100 Hondurans requested asylum in Mexico in the first nine months of 2022.The December 2022 state of exception curtailed constitutional rights, allowing authorities to restrict movement in parts of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula.",2,"Corruption, crime, and gang activity inhibit the ability to conduct business activities freely and dissuade entrepreneurs from establishing new businesses. Taxi and bus drivers are notable targets of gangs.",2,"Same-sex marriage remains illegal in Honduras, despite ongoing calls for reform from LGBT+ activists. A 2019 law banned same-sex couples from adopting children despite the objection of activists, who called the bill excessive and discriminatory. Abortion is illegal in Honduras, including in cases of rape or incest, with criminal sanctions including imprisonment for those accused of terminating their pregnancies. Emergency contraception is also illegal.Domestic violence remains widespread and largely goes unpunished. Honduras has one of the world’s highest femicide rates, and these murders are rarely investigated. According to the Center for Women’s Rights, a local NGO, 297 women died by femicide in 2022.",2,"Lack of socioeconomic opportunities combined with high levels of crime and violence limit social mobility for most Hondurans and exacerbate income inequality. Human trafficking remains a significant issue. Honduras serves as a source country for women and children forced into prostitution. Adults and children are also vulnerable to forced labor in agriculture, mining, and other sectors, and as domestic servants.",2
hungary,There are no significant restrictions on Hungarians’ freedom of travel or their ability to change their place of residence or employment. Movement restrictions and curfews related to the COVID-19 pandemic were instituted based on epidemiological data.,4,"Individuals have the right to own property and establish private businesses. However, the success of a business is somewhat dependent upon its owner’s government connections. Businesspeople whose activities are not in line with the financial or political interest of the government are likely to face harassment and intimidation, and subject to increasing administrative pressure for a possible takeover. In August 2022, the minister of justice announced that the airline Ryanair was to be fined for unfair trade practices. The company’s chief executive had publicly criticized the government’s May 2022 small-business tax.Changes in 2022 to the small-business tax scheme were adopted overnight without public consultation and negatively affected hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs.",3,"The constitution defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. LGBT+ Hungarians are allowed to pursue civil unions.In 2020, the National Assembly ended the legal recognition of gender identity for transgender people. As a result of the Ninth Amendment of the Fundamental Law, the constitution now stipulates that “the mother is a woman, the father is a man,” and “Hungary protects the right of children to self-identify in line with their birth sex.” Furthermore, the law effectively limits the right to adoption only to married couples, excluding single people and non-married partners—among them same-sex couples—from this right.Domestic violence and spousal rape are illegal, but the definition of rape hinges on the use of force or coercion, not on lack of consent. NGOs describe government responses to violence against women as inadequate. In 2020, the parliament rejected the ratification of the Istanbul Convention over what parliamentarians considered to be the destructive nature of the convention’s gender ideology and the document’s preferential treatment for asylum seekers based on gender. While the government has opened victim support centers in recent years, there have been numerous media reports about domestic violence cases having fatal consequences.Though the constitution defines life as beginning from conception, the statutory regime makes abortion broadly available. However, in September 2022, the government unexpectedly restricted access to abortion by ministerial degree, dubbed a “heartbeat law,” requiring the presentation of the fetus’s vital functions to the pregnant person before the termination of the pregnancy.",3,"Hungary is a transit point, source, and to a lesser extent, destination for trafficked persons, including women trafficked for prostitution. Prevention, coordination efforts, and processes to identify and support victims remain inadequate, while trafficking investigations and enforcement of relevant laws are unreliable. In 2020, the government adopted a National Strategy against Human Trafficking for 2020–23, which included harsher sanctions for traffickers. The parliament also amended the relevant laws primarily to protect children against sexual exploitation.A 2018 labor code amendment significantly raised the maximum hours of overtime employers are allowed to ask for per year.",3
iceland,"Freedom of movement is constitutionally protected and respected in practice. Although travel to and from Iceland was affected by COVID-19-related regulations, a total lockdown was never imposed. All COVID-19-related restrictions were lifted by February 2022.",4,There is generally no undue government interference in business or private property ownership.,4,"Parliament unanimously passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage in 2010, and a 2006 law established full and equal rights for same-sex couples in matters of adoption and assisted pregnancy. Comprehensive legislation on transgender issues ensures full and equal rights for transgender people and guarantees relevant healthcare, among other provisions. Abortions through the 22nd week of pregnancy are permitted without requiring special approval.",4,"Citizens generally enjoy fair access to economic opportunity. However, the systematic exploitation of migrant workers has become a significant problem in recent years, especially in the tourism industry. Employers who exploit workers have largely acted with impunity due to an inadequate government response. Wage theft is not punishable by law. There are reports of forced labor, primarily involving migrants, in the construction and service industries, and of forced sex work in nightclubs.Iceland criminalized human trafficking in 2009. In the 2022 edition of its Trafficking in Persons Report, the US State Department reported that one person had been prosecuted and convicted of trafficking in Iceland during the year, the first such case since 2010.",3
india,"The constitution grants citizens the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. However, freedom of movement is hampered in some parts of the country by insurgent violence or communal tensions. Several states require companies to reserve jobs for locals, limiting opportunities for interstate migration, although enforcement of the quotas is reportedly limited.India’s large internal migrant population suffered significant hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the government imposed an excessively harsh lockdown that offered little assistance or security to low-paid workers. Millions were consequently compelled to travel from cities to their native villages for lack of employment and essential supplies. In 2021, a government think tank published a policy framework that aimed to ease interstate movement among other goals. This situation abated in January 2022 when the national government directed states to shorten coronavirus-related isolation periods.",3,"Although the legal framework generally supports the right to own property and engage in private business activity, property rights are somewhat tenuous for tribal groups and other marginalized communities. Members of these groups are often denied adequate resettlement opportunities and compensation when their lands are seized for development projects. While many states have laws to prevent transfers of tribal land to nontribal groups, the practice is reportedly widespread, particularly with respect to the mining and timber industries. Muslim personal status laws and traditional Hindu practices discriminate against women in terms of property rights and inheritance.Muslim-owned properties were demolished by authorities in several areas in 2022. In April, authorities in Delhi, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh responded to communal unrest by demolishing Muslim-owned structures. In June, authorities in Uttar Pradesh destroyed three Muslim-owned houses in an apparent act of reprisal against protests; authorities claimed the homes were illegally constructed. In October, authorities in Madhya Pradesh destroyed three men’s homes after they were accused of throwing stones during a Hindu ceremony. In June, three UN special rapporteurs wrote a letter objecting to the practice. ",2,"Rape and other sexual abuse are serious problems, and scheduled-caste and tribal women are especially vulnerable. Mass demonstrations after the fatal gang rape of a woman on a Delhi bus in 2012 prompted the government to enact significant legal reforms, but egregious rape cases continue to surface. The criminal justice system as well as prominent politicians have been repeatedly faulted for their poor handling of such matters.Despite criminalization and hundreds of convictions each year, dowry demands surrounding marriage persist, sometimes resulting in violence. A 2006 law banned dowry-related harassment, widened the definition of domestic violence to include emotional or verbal abuse, and criminalized spousal sexual violence, but enforcement is reportedly poor.In August 2022, the Supreme Court expanded the official definition of the family to include same-sex parents and other households that had been deemed “atypical.”Several BJP-led states have passed or proposed laws meant to stem the alleged practice of “love jihad”—a baseless conspiracy theory according to which Muslims marry Hindu women with the goal of converting them to Islam. The legislation effectively created obstacles to interfaith marriages and raised the risk of legal penalties, harassment, and violence for interfaith couples. In February 2022, the BJP argued for toughening penalties on interfaith marriages ahead of the Uttar Pradesh state elections.Muslim personal status laws and traditional Hindu practices feature gender discrimination on matters such as marriage, divorce, and child custody. A Muslim divorce custom allowing a man to unilaterally divorce his wife was criminalized in 2019. The malign neglect of female children after birth remains a concern, as does the banned use of prenatal sex-determination tests to selectively abort female fetuses.",2,"The constitution bans human trafficking, and bonded labor is illegal, but estimates of the number of workers still affected by the practice range from 20 to 50 million. A 2016 law allows children below the age of 14 to engage in “home-based work,” as well as other occupations between the ages of 14 and 18. Children are not permitted to work in potentially hazardous industries, though the rule is routinely flouted. The use of child labor reportedly surged during COVID-19 lockdowns, as schools were closed and families faced severe economic hardships. There have been reports of complicity by law enforcement officials in human trafficking.",2
indonesia,"Freedoms to travel and change one’s place of residence, employment, or higher education are generally respected. However, Indonesians engaging in these administrative processes are sometimes vulnerable to bribery. Papuans have additionally faced restrictions on movement from security forces; residents in Intan Jaya Regency reported that they must ask security officers’ permission to move about, are questioned about their movements, and are subjected to checks. In March 2022, UN experts expressed concern over ongoing violence and internal displacement in the Papua region. Some 5,000 Indigenous Papuans were displaced between April and November 2021 according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The OHCHR also counted at least 60,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) since December 2018. IDPs often flee without their identity cards, leaving them without access to services.",2,"Despite a robust private sector, corruption hampers business activity. Property rights are threatened by state appropriation and licensing of communally owned land to companies, particularly impacting Indigenous communities and others with unregistered or customary land rights. Women have relatively poor rights to marital property. Ethnic Chinese in Yogyakarta face restrictions on private property ownership under a 1975 decree contravening national laws.",2,"Abortion is illegal except as life-saving treatment or in instances of rape. Adults over the age of 15 must have corroboration and witnesses to bring rape charges.In April 2022, the parliament passed a sexual violence bill, which criminalizes sexual harassment, forced contraception and sterilization, forced marriage, sexual torture, slavery and exploitation, and online sexual violence.The criminal code approved by the parliament in December 2022 prohibits cohabitation of unmarried people as well as consensual extramarital sex; Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned that millions of couples who lack marriage certificates would run afoul of the new code. The criminal code also prohibits the dissemination of information on contraception to minors. The minimum age for marriage is set at 19. Marriages must be conducted under the supervision of a recognized religion, which obstructs interfaith marriages. Local Sharia-based ordinances in many districts impose restrictions on dress, gambling, alcohol use, and sexual activity; these ordinances are disproportionately enforced against women and LGBT+ people. Public displays of affection are banned in Aceh Province under Sharia-based regulations.",2,"Authorities set standards for working conditions and compensation, but enforcement is inconsistent. Indonesian workers are trafficked domestically and abroad, including women in domestic service and men in the fishing industry. In January 2022, authorities in North Sumatra discovered a cage used to detain workers on a plantation operated by a local regent.",2
iran,"Freedom of movement is restricted, particularly for women and perceived opponents of the regime. Many journalists and activists have been prevented from leaving the country. Women are banned from certain public places and can generally obtain a passport to travel abroad only with the permission of their fathers or husbands. In August 2022, authorities allowed women to attend a professional domestic soccer game. Women had been barred from attending soccer matches in stadiums since the 1979 revolution, but in recent years a limited number of women have been allowed into stadiums for international matches amid increased pressure on Iran to remove the ban.",1,"Iranians have the legal right to own property and establish private businesses. However, powerful institutions like the IRGC play a dominant role in the economy, limiting fair competition and opportunities for entrepreneurs, and bribery is said to be widespread in the business environment, including for registration and obtaining licenses. Women are denied equal rights in inheritance matters.",1,"Social freedoms are restricted in Iran. All residents, but particularly women, are subject to obligatory rules on dress and personal appearance, and those who are deemed to have violated the rules face state harassment, fines, and arrest. It was reported in July 2022 that officials in Qom had closed three cafés due the presence of female customers who were not wearing headscarves. In early September 2022, the secretary of the regime’s Headquarters for Promoting Virtue and Preventing Vice said that authorities were planning to use facial recognition technology in public places to identify women who were not obeying official hijab requirements.Following Mahsa Amini’s death in September 2022, an increasing number of women appeared in public without their headscarves as an act of civil disobedience. Dozens were arrested, including a number of prominent actresses. The police unit that enforces the hijab rules reportedly disappeared from the streets of major cities, however, and in December 2022 an official stated that morality patrols had been abolished.Police have long conducted raids on private gatherings that breach rules against alcohol consumption and the mixing of unrelated men and women. Those attending can be detained and fined or sentenced to corporal punishment in the form of lashes.Women do not enjoy equal rights in divorce and child custody disputes. In 2019, the Guardian Council approved a legal amendment that would enable Iranian women married to foreign men to request Iranian citizenship for their children. The first identification cards for such children were issued in 2021.Iranians can receive an abortion within the first four months of a pregnancy if three doctors decide that the mother’s life is at risk or if the fetus shows signs of severe disability. In 2021 the Guardian Council ratified the Youthful Population and Protection of the Family Law, which strengthened enforcement of abortion restrictions and established a committee that includes judicial representatives, Islamic jurists, doctors, and legislators to develop new regulations. The law also bans voluntary sterilization and the distribution of free contraceptives.",1,"The government provides no protection to women and children forced into sex trafficking, and both Iranians and migrant workers from countries like Afghanistan are subject to forced labor and debt bondage. The IRGC has allegedly used coercive tactics to recruit thousands of Afghan migrants living in Iran to fight in Syria. Human Rights Watch has reported that children as young as 14 are among those recruited.The population faces widespread economic hardship driven by a combination of US-led trade sanctions and mismanagement by the regime. The crisis has resulted in the rapid devaluation of the national currency and soaring prices for basic goods. In September 2022, Alena Douhan, the UN special rapporteur on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures, said in a report that sanctions on Iran affected most aspects of life in the country, and she called for them to be lifted.",1
iraq,"Freedom of movement has improved somewhat as areas formerly controlled by IS were brought back under government control. However, large-scale destruction of housing and infrastructure, the presence of sectarian or partisan militias, and the ongoing threat of violence has made it difficult for many displaced people to return home. The renewed IS insurgency and the Iraqi Security Forces’ corresponding response, as well as fighting between the Turkish military and the PKK in northern Iraq have constrained the freedom of movement of residents in rural western and northern Iraq.The KRG also continues to prevent Arab families from returning to villages on the border with Syria, from which they fled during fighting between the Peshmerga and IS in 2014.The movement of women is limited by legal restrictions. Women require the consent of a male guardian to obtain a passport and the Civil Status Identification Document, which is needed to access employment, education, and many social services.",1,"Iraqis are legally free to own property and establish businesses, but observance of property rights has been limited by corruption and conflict. Families perceived to be affiliated with IS living in displacement are particularly vulnerable to confiscation or takeover of their property. Business owners face demands for bribes, threats, and violent attempts to seize their enterprises. Contracts are difficult to enforce. Women are legally disadvantaged with respect to inheritance rights and may face pressure to yield their rights to male relatives.In Baghdad’s middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, such as Jadriya and Karrada, pro-Iranian militias have used threats and violent intimidation to force owners of large homes to give up their property, expanding a practice previously employed against Sunnis and Christians in the capital. In Iraqi Kurdistan, the recent construction boom has sometimes come at the expense of local landowners and farmers, whose fields are confiscated without notice or compensation.",1,"Forced and early marriages are common, especially in the context of displacement and poverty. Over one in four Iraqi women aged 20 to 24 were married by age 18, and marriage for those aged 15 is legal with parental approval. Laws on marriage and divorce favor men over women. No law banning domestic violence exists, and Iraqi husbands are allowed to “punish” their wives and children. Iraqi women’s rights organizations’ efforts to compel Parliament to pass a law banning gender-based violence have been unsuccessful. Rapists can avoid prosecution if they marry their victims; spousal rape is not prohibited. The law also allows reduced sentences for those convicted of so-called honor killings, which are seldom punished in practice. These types of crimes typically involve a male relative targeting a woman (sister or wife) or an LGBT+ person. Both men and women face pressure to conform to conservative standards on personal appearance and face harassment, detention, and abuse by state actors and relatives for diverging from traditional appearance or mannerisms that match their biological sex.",1,"As of 2022, over 2,700 Yazidi women and children who had been kidnapped by IS during the 2014 genocide of Yazidi people remain missing. Many of them were likely forced into sexual slavery or forced labor. Exploitation of children, including through forced begging and the recruitment of child soldiers by militias, is an ongoing problem. Foreign migrant workers frequently work long hours for low pay and are vulnerable to forced labor. According to the US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons report, human trafficking continues unabated throughout Iraq—at times with the protection of corrupt officials—and internally displaced persons, refugees, migrant workers, and LGBT+ people are particularly vulnerable.

A study published in 2022 by the International Labor Organization shows that almost 55 percent of total employment in Iraq is in the informal sector, where employees have limited protections, benefits, and work stability.",1
ireland,"There are ordinarily no restrictions on travel or the ability to change one’s place of residence, employment, or education.",4,"Private businesses are free to operate, and property rights are generally respected.",4,"Individuals in Ireland have gained expanded social freedoms in recent years. In a 2015 referendum, voters extended marriage rights to same-sex couples. That same year, the Children and Family Relationships Act extended adoption rights to same-sex and cohabiting heterosexual couples, and the Gender Recognition Act allowed transgender individuals to obtain legal recognition without medical or state intervention, and—for married transgender people—without divorcing. In a 2018 referendum, voters abolished a constitutional amendment that made nearly all abortions illegal, and health providers began performing abortions in 2019.In 2019, Ireland enacted the Domestic Violence Act 2018, which criminalized forms of emotional and psychological abuse. However, domestic and sexual violence against women remain serious problems, and marginalized and immigrant women have particular difficulty accessing support. In January 2022, the killing of 23-year-old teacher and musician Ashling Murphy while she was jogging outside in Tullamore led to widespread condemnation of violence against women in Ireland. According to Safe Ireland, a women and children’s advocacy group, 11 more women were murdered in Ireland over the course of the year. Justice Minister Helen McEntee in August 2022 announced that new antistalking legislation as well as other measures addressing gender-based violence would be introduced and enacted before the end of the year, but they were still before the Dáil at year’s end.",4,"People generally enjoy equality of opportunity.

Although the government works to combat human trafficking and protect victims, undocumented migrant workers remain at risk of trafficking and labor exploitation.",4
israel,"Security measures can sometimes present obstacles to freedom of movement, though military checkpoints are restricted to the West Bank. Informal local rules that prevent driving on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays can also hamper free movement. In June 2022, the Ministry of Interior issued a new regulation that prohibits asylum seekers from working outside of construction, agriculture, institution-based caregiving, hotels, and restaurants. The regulation, which came into effect in October and applies to 17 municipalities with large numbers of asylum seekers, was made possible by an October 2021 Supreme Court ruling that determined that limiting the employment of asylum seekers is permitted by Israeli law. A number of asylum seekers filed an appeal against the regulation in September 2022.Migrant workers in the caregiving sector are only allowed to work within a specific geographical area assigned to them, and can only switch employers three times in the span of their time in Israel, which is generally capped at five years.",3,"Property rights within Israel are effectively protected, and business activity is generally free of undue interference. Businesses face a low risk of expropriation or criminal activity, and corruption is not a major obstacle for private investors. Migrant workers and asylum seekers are barred from owning businesses, forcing them to hire Israeli partners to be able to run their business. However, the authorities’ general commitment to property rights has been called into question given their handling of unrecognized Bedouin villages and their settlement policies in the occupied territories.",3,"Personal social freedoms are generally guaranteed. However, since religious courts oversee personal status issues, women face some disadvantages in divorce and other matters. Many ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities attempt to enforce unofficial rules on gender separation and personal attire in the public sphere. Marriages between Jews and non-Jews are not recognized by the state unless conducted abroad, nor are marriages involving a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man. Israel recognizes same-sex marriages conducted abroad. Nonbiological parents in same-sex partnerships are eligible for guardianship rights. A 2018 law extended surrogacy rights to women without a male partner but not to men without a female partner, effectively excluding gay men. In June 2022, a parliamentary committee approved loosening restrictions on Israel’s abortion law; among other things, access to abortion pills will be provided through Israel’s health care system.",3,"Israel remains a destination for human-trafficking victims, and African students, migrant workers, and asylum seekers residing in the country are especially vulnerable to forced labor and other forms of exploitation. In 2021, the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report demoted Israel to Tier 2, citing the government’s insufficient efforts to combat human trafficking. Roughly 30 percent of Palestinian laborers working in Israel have been forced to pay illegal fees to brokers to obtain Israeli work permits; those forced to pay the fee thus enter Israel in debt, making them less likely to quit due to abusive employment conditions. Some migrant workers in the caregiving sector who left their employers due to abuse have had their visas voided by Israeli authorities without a hearing.",2

Delays in court proceedings often undermine enforcement of protections for property rights. According to experts on organized crime, mafia groups exploited the social and economic crises provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic, expanding control of cash-starved local businesses via loan-sharking and money-laundering operations.",3,"The law protects individual freedom on personal status issues such as marriage and divorce. Same-sex civil unions with nearly all the benefits of marriage are permitted, and courts have begun to recognize second-parent adoption rights for same-sex couples. Though public awareness of the problem of domestic violence is increasing due to advocacy campaigns, it remains a persistent issue, and calls to the national domestic violence hotline rose significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown.",4,"In the last few years, Italy has adopted measures to combat human trafficking and labor exploitation, but both phenomena remain concerns, especially with respect to asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants from Eastern Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis following the Russian government’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 increased migrants’ vulnerability to exploitation and worsened labor and living conditions.

japan,"There are few significant restrictions on internal or international travel, or on individuals’ ability to change their place of residence, employment, and education.",4,"Property rights are generally respected, and individuals are free to establish and operate private businesses.",4,"While personal social freedoms are mostly protected, there are some limitations. The country’s system of family registration, koseki, recognizes people as members of a family unit and requires married couples to share a surname, which usually defaults to the husband’s surname. This can create legal complications for women as well as children born out of wedlock or to divorced parents, among others. There is no legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Japan, though some municipal and prefectural governments, including the Tokyo metropolitan government, have passed legislation allowing the registration of same-sex partnerships. Domestic violence is punishable by law, and protective orders and other services are available for victims, but such abuse often goes unreported.",3,"Individuals generally enjoy equality of opportunity, and the legal framework provides safeguards against exploitative working conditions. However, long workdays are common in practice and have been criticized as harmful to workers’ health. Many workers are temporary or contract employees with substantially lower wages, fewer benefits, and less job security than regular employees.The government announced in July 2022 that it would review the foreign technology trainee program, in which about 328,000 trainees were participating at that time. According to investigations in some prefectures, roughly 60 to 70 percent of the companies employing foreign trainees violated labor laws, suggesting that abuse and exploitation may be common throughout the program.Commercial sexual exploitation remains a problem.

The government does not recognize marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men. Matters such as marriage and divorce are handled by religious courts, which place women and converts from Islam at a disadvantage and restrict some interfaith marriages. In recent years, the parliament has adopted laws that better regulate the processing of domestic violence complaints and abolish a penal code provision allowing rapists to avoid punishment by marrying their victims. However, reduced sentences are still possible for those who murder a spouse caught committing adultery, and spousal rape is not a crime. Women marrying for the first time must obtain approval of a male guardian.",2,"Migrant workers, who are the majority of the Jordanian garment industry’s workforce, are especially vulnerable to exploitative labor practices. Labor rights organizations have raised concerns about poor working conditions, forced labor, and sexual abuse in Qualifying Industrial Zones, where mostly women and foreign factory workers process goods for export. Rules governing minimum wage, working hours, and safety standards are not well enforced. Syrian refugees are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and, as many are without work permits, often work in the informal sector for low wages.Economic hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic increased the prevalence of child labor dramatically, according to local NGOs. Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, and the government and civil society groups have failed or are unable to provide adequate aid.As of April 2022, 148,269 Jordanians were wanted to serve prison terms for unpaid debt, a practice that is widespread in Jordan and is in violation of international human rights law.

According to official government data, 57 criminal cases of human trafficking were initiated in the first half of 2022, which was more than the first six months of the previous year. Some experts claim that official statistics do not fully depict the extent of trafficking in Kazakhstan, which serves as a source, destination, and transit country for human trafficking. The authorities reportedly make little effort to assist foreign victims of trafficking.",2
kenya,"While the constitution provides protections for freedom of movement and related rights, they are impeded in practice by security concerns and ethnic tensions that lead many residents to avoid certain parts of the country. The enforcement of COVID-19 lockdown measures was disproportionate and often excessively implemented. However, all COVID-19-related restrictions were lifted by May 2022.",2,"Organized crime continues to threaten legitimate business activity in Kenya. Political corruption and ethnic favoritism also affect the business sector and exacerbate existing imbalances in wealth and access to economic opportunities, including public sector jobs.Forced evictions without compensation are prevalent in low-income areas, particularly in Nairobi. In 2021, Nairobi authorities evicted over 40,000 people in an informal settlement to make way for a highway.",1,"The constitution recognizes marriage as a union between two people of the opposite sex, but otherwise does not place explicit restrictions on social freedoms. Polygamy is legal, and approximately 10 percent of the married population are in polygamous marriages. Rape and domestic violence remain common and are rarely prosecuted. In a 2021 report, Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned that survivors of gender-based violence receive insufficient government support.",2,"Kenya remains an unequal society, with wealth generally concentrated in towns and cities. The arid and semiarid north and northeastern parts of the country have particularly high poverty rates. Refugees and asylum seekers from neighboring countries, particularly children, have been vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor in Kenya, though Kenyan children are also subject to such abuses. Kenyan workers are recruited for employment abroad in sometimes exploitative conditions, particularly in the Middle East and southeast Asia.",2
kiribati,"While there are no significant constraints on internal freedom of movement, the government did impose overnight curfews in South Tarawa and Betio in May 2021, after two crewmembers of a fishing vessel tested positive for COVID-19. In January 2022 the country entered another lockdown as the virus’s Omicron variant spread through Tarawa; most travel restrictions had been lifted by early August.",4,"The government operates a system of land registration and generally upholds property rights. Land is owned on either an individual or a kinship basis, and inheritance laws pertaining to land favor sons over daughters.",3,"There are few legal restrictions on personal freedom regarding matters such as marriage and divorce, though same-sex marriage is not permitted, and citizenship laws allow fathers but not mothers to confer citizenship on children. Domestic violence is criminalized but remains a serious and widespread problem. A 2019 survey in South Tarawa found that 38 percent of women had experienced physical or sexual violence by a male partner. Cultural norms deter formal complaints and police interventions.",3,"There are few economic opportunities in Kiribati, with most citizens engaged in subsistence agriculture, fishing, and other informal-sector activities that lack effective legal safeguards on issues like wages and working hours. According to the US State Department, the public sector accounts for some 80 percent of formal employment. Although forced labor and other exploitative working conditions are uncommon, local women and girls are vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation, often involving the crews of visiting ships.Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 2015, children and adolescents are restricted from professions considered dangerous. The Employment and Industrial Relations Act of 2015 sets the minimum employment age for most work at 14 years and the minimum age for “hazardous” work at 18. Enforcement of these laws, while active, is limited by financial constraints.",3
kosovo,"Freedom of movement and residence is somewhat restricted in Kosovo, especially for those living in ethnic Serb areas. In August 2022 the governments of Kosovo and Serbia reached an agreement on travel identification that made cross-border movement easier. Tensions rose over Kosovo authorities’ plan to issue fines for those with Serb-issued license plates, but a deal that deescalated the situation was reached in November.",3,"The legal framework on property rights is poorly outlined, and those rights are inadequately enforced in practice. While the law states that inheritance must be split equally between male and female heirs, strong patriarchal attitudes lead to pressure on women to relinquish their rights to male family members. A number of policies incentivize co-ownership, where couples who wish to register their properties jointly have their municipal taxes and fees waived. However, this has not significantly increased the percentage of properties owned by women. Property reclamation by displaced persons is hindered by threats of violence and local resistance to accepting returnees.",1,"Domestic violence remains a problem. When criminal cases are referred, prosecutions and convictions are rare. Rape is illegal, but spousal rape is not addressed by the law. Courts often give convicted rapists sentences that are lighter than the prescribed minimum.Same-sex marriage is not legally recognized in Kosovo, though LGBT+ activists say that provisions in the constitution implicitly permit same-sex marriages. In March 2022, a draft civil code with provisions for the registration of same-sex civil unions was rejected by parliament, triggering protests.",2,"Kosovo is a source, transit point, and destination for human trafficking.

Although the law permits the establishment of businesses, bureaucratic obstacles sometimes slow the process, and fair competition can be impaired by nepotism or corruption. Companies are legally prohibited from conducting business with citizens of Israel.Sharia-based inheritance rules, particularly those pertaining to Sunni families, put women at a disadvantage.",1,"Personal status laws favor men over women in matters of marriage, divorce, and child custody. For example, Sunni women must have the approval of a male guardian to marry and are only permitted to seek a divorce when deserted or subjected to domestic violence. Domestic abuse and spousal rape are not specifically prohibited by law, and rapists can avoid punishment if they marry their victims.Article 153 of the penal code classifies crimes in which a man kills a close female relative whom he has caught in “an unsavory sexual act” as misdemeanors, punishable by at most three years in prison. Such incidents are rare but not entirely unknown; a local civil society campaign seeks to eliminate the penal code provision.A 2020 law designed to combat domestic violence provides for shelters, restraining orders, and legal assistance for victims, among other components. However, it does not criminalize domestic violence or cover gender-based violence outside the immediate household.In February 2022, the Constitutional Court found Article 198 of the penal code, which criminalizes “imitating the opposite sex,” to be unconstitutional. Despite this positive step, transgender people still experience discrimination based on their appearance, and several Islamist members of parliament have called for a new law to replace Article 198.",2,"Foreign household workers and other migrant workers are highly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, often forced to live and work in poor or dangerous conditions for low pay. Despite some legal protections designed to prevent mistreatment, many employers reportedly confiscate their household workers’ passports, subject them to excessive working hours, and restrict their movements outside the home. Recruiting agents are known to hold female migrant workers for ransom, demanding money from their families before they could return home. Other migrant workers have been repatriated by the state labor bureau after being refused payment or otherwise harassed or abused by their employers.",1

The ethnic violence of 2010 has affected property rights in the south, as many businesses, mainly owned by ethnic Uzbeks, were destroyed or seized.",2,"Cultural constraints and inaction by law enforcement officials discourage victims of domestic violence and rape from contacting the authorities. Legislation enacted in 2017 aimed to broaden the definition of domestic abuse and improve both victim assistance and responses from law enforcement bodies, but the law is weakly enforced.The practice of bride abduction persists despite the strengthening of legal penalties in 2013, and few perpetrators are prosecuted.",2,"The government does not actively enforce workplace health and safety standards. Child labor is restricted by law but reportedly occurs, particularly in the agricultural sector. The trafficking of women and girls into forced prostitution abroad is a serious problem. Police have been accused of complicity in the trafficking and exploitation of sex trafficking victims, and reportedly accept bribes from traffickers. Kyrgyzstani men are especially vulnerable to trafficking for forced labor abroad.",1

Marriage among girls younger than 18 is allowed with parental permission and fairly common in practice, especially in rural areas.",2,"Regulations against unsafe or exploitative working conditions are poorly enforced. Trafficking in persons is common, and enforcement of antitrafficking measures is hindered by a lack of transparency and weak rule of law. The US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report 2022 notes that the Laotian government is working to combat human trafficking, but calls its efforts to identify Laotian and foreign survivors insufficient. The country’s worsening economic situation since the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted greater trafficking of women to China and a massive migration of workers, usually illegally, to Thailand and other neighboring states.",1

Nevertheless, citizens find it extremely difficult to transfer official places of residence for voting purposes. They also face de facto sectarian boundaries and militia checkpoints in some areas.Noncitizens are subject to much harsher restrictions on movement. Many Palestinians classified as refugees live in designated camps, and access to those areas is controlled and often constrained by Lebanese security services. Many Syrian refugees live in informal camps or smaller settlements, and are subject to curfews and other obstacles to movement.Migrant workers face severe restrictions on movement under a sponsorship system that revokes their residency rights if they are dismissed by their designated employers. Employers often confiscate migrant workers’ passports, further reducing their autonomy.",1,"Lebanese law protects citizens’ rights to own property and operate private businesses, but powerful groups and individuals sometimes engage in land-grabbing and other infringements without consequence, and business activity is impaired by bureaucratic obstacles and corruption.Refugees, including longtime Palestinian residents, have few property rights. Women have weaker property rights than men under the religious codes that govern inheritance and other personal status issues in Lebanon, and they often face family pressure to transfer property to male relatives.",2,"Because the religious codes and courts of each confessional community determine personal status law in Lebanon, people’s rights regarding marriage, divorce, and child custody depend on their affiliation, though women are typically at a disadvantage compared with men. The incidence of child marriage has reportedly increased in recent years, particularly among refugee populations. Partners seeking to enter an interfaith marriage often travel abroad, as Lebanon recognizes civil marriages performed elsewhere. Women cannot pass Lebanese citizenship to non-Lebanese spouses or children of non-Lebanese fathers. Same-sex marriage remains illegal in Lebanon. However, transgender people have some legal precedent allowing them to live publicly based on their gender identity; a 2016 Court of Appeals ruling allowed a transgender man to legally change his gender in the civil registry and supported the plaintiff’s desire to seek gender confirmation surgery.",2,"Citizens’ communal affiliation can either enhance or restrict their economic opportunities in a given area, company, or public-sector entity, depending on which group is in a dominant position. Individuals must also contend with political patronage and clientelism, layered on top of communally enabled corruption, in the public and private sectors.All residents of Lebanon have faced hardship amid the economic crisis that emerged in 2019, featuring rampant inflation, currency devaluation, import shortages, and a sharp rise in poverty rates. However, noncitizens, such as refugees and migrant workers, are subject to particular disadvantages and have long been especially vulnerable to exploitative working conditions and sex trafficking. The authorities do not effectively enforce laws against child labor, which is common among Syrian refugees, rural Lebanese, and segments of the urban poor.Household workers and migrant workers who operate under the sponsorship system routinely suffer from economic exploitation. Employers are favored in legal cases involving migrant workers, discouraging the latter from reporting denial of wages and contract obligations as well as physical, psychological, and sexual abuse.",1

As of mid-2022 there were about 140,000 internally displaced people in Libya, representing a reduction of more than 50 percent since the cease-fire, though many were still unable to return home.Corruption is a problem for those seeking to advance their employment or education. In 2022, the Ministry of Education introduced regulations aimed at addressing the use of forged university degrees to falsely obtain government jobs.",0,"While Libyans formally have the right to own property and can start businesses, legal protections are not upheld in practice. The Qadhafi regime’s Law No. 7 of 1986 abolished land ownership, leading to decades of squatting in private domiciles and ongoing disputes over property rights. Businesses and homes have been damaged amid fighting or confiscated by militias in recent years, particularly in Libya’s eastern regions. Persistent insecurity has severely disrupted ordinary commerce, allowing armed groups to dominate smuggling networks and informal markets.",1,"Laws and social customs disadvantage women in personal status matters including marriage and divorce. Libyan women with foreign husbands do not enjoy full citizenship rights and cannot transfer Libyan citizenship to their children; the GNU granted citizenship to a group of more than 100 such children in June 2022, and in October it decreed that all children of Libyan mothers and foreign fathers would have access to public education and health care.There are no laws that specifically address or criminalize domestic violence, and most such violence goes unreported due to social stigma and the risk of reprisals. The law imposes penalties for extramarital sex and allows rapists to avoid punishment by marrying their victims.

Forced labor, sexual exploitation, abuse in detention facilities, and starvation are widespread among migrants and refugees from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, many of whom are beholden to human traffickers. Libya lacks comprehensive laws criminalizing human trafficking, and the authorities have been either incapable of enforcing existing bans or complicit in trafficking activity. Traffickers have established enterprises in which refugees and migrants are loaded into overcrowded boats that are then abandoned in the Mediterranean Sea, where passengers hope to be rescued and taken to Europe.

The RMI was upgraded to Tier 2 in the US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report due to the RMI government’s significant and increasing efforts to improve its response to trafficking crimes in the country.",3
mauritania,"While the Bidhan population is relatively free to make personal decisions about residence, employment, and education, the choices of Black Mauritanians and the Haratin are often constrained by racial and caste-based discrimination. People without government identity cards are not allowed to travel in some regions, which disproportionately affects Black Mauritanians.",1,"Legally guaranteed property rights are not always enforced in practice, as it can be difficult to get property disputes fairly adjudicated in court. Complex laws and an opaque bureaucracy present challenges to starting a business.Many Black Mauritanians who left their homes in the Senegal River Valley in the wake of the 1989 conflict have been unable to regain ownership of their land since returning. Local authorities reportedly allow Bidhan to appropriate land used by Haratin and Black Mauritanians. Residents of some southern villages have pushed back against what they consider unlawful expropriation of their land by the government and powerful investors.",2,"According to 2022 data from the UN Children’s Fund, as many as 40 percent of Mauritanian women were married as children. Female genital mutilation is illegal, but the law is rarely enforced and the practice remains common. Domestic violence and rape remain problems, victims rarely seek legal redress, and convictions for these crimes are rare. Laws banning adultery and morality offenses discourage sexual assault survivors from reporting incidents to police.",1,"Despite 2015 amendments to the antislavery law, slavery and similar practices remain a challenge, with many former slaves still reliant on their former owners due to racial discrimination, poverty, and other socioeconomic factors. The government has cracked down on NGOs that push for greater enforcement of the law and rarely prosecutes perpetrators, though two slave owners received prison terms in 2020. In November 2022, the National Human Rights Commission announced the establishment of a hotline to report cases of slavery.",0

Mauritians are free to change their place of residence, employment, and education.",4,"Mauritius is considered among the most business-friendly countries in Africa. However, the Non-Citizen Property Restriction Act limits most noncitizens from owning or acquiring property. Corruption can hamper business activity.",3,"The government generally does not limit social freedoms, though same-sex relations are punishable by five years in prison. Rape is against the law, but spousal rape is not specifically criminalized. Domestic violence is illegal but remains a significant concern.In June 2021, Mauritius added provisions to the Quarantine Act requiring all citizens be vaccinated with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Penalties for violating the requirement include up to a five-year jail term.",3,"Women and children are vulnerable to sex trafficking. In its 2022 Human Trafficking Report, the US Department of State noted a continued absence of standard operating procedures for victim identification, a lack of victim-centered approaches, lenient sentences from courts, weak deterrence, a lack of investigation of traffickers exploiting individuals for forced labor, and a lack of identification of victims of forced labor.The position of migrant workers in the manufacturing and construction sectors can be precarious. Mauritian labor rights advocacy organizations have claimed that the government rollback of labor protection laws in response to COVID-19 led to more exploitation of migrant workers, and these laws have yet to be restored.While Mauritius enjoys a comparatively high, and growing, gross domestic product, inequality soared during the pandemic. The World Bank has warned that failing to implement growth strategies that prioritize the poor will contribute to a significant widening of inequality through 2030. With global factors driving high inflation in 2022, particularly on food and oil prices, there are pervasive concerns that widening inequality will lead to greater economic exploitation of individuals already at the margins.",2
mexico,"Citizens are generally free to change their place of residence, employment, or education. However, criminals have impeded freedom of movement by blocking major roads in several states in recent years, and ordinary citizens avoid roads in many rural areas after dark.",3,"Property rights in Mexico are protected by a modern legal framework, but the weakness of the judicial system, frequent solicitation of bribes by bureaucrats and officials, and the high incidence of criminal extortion harm security of property for many individuals and businesses. Large-scale development projects, including high-priority López Obrador initiatives, have been accompanied by corruption and rights-related controversy in recent years.",2,"Sexual abuse and domestic violence against women are common, and perpetrators are rarely punished. Implementation of a 2007 law designed to protect women from such crimes remains halting, particularly at the state level, and impunity is the norm for the killers of hundreds of women each year. State authorities can issue “gender alerts” that trigger greater scrutiny and an influx of resources to combat an epidemic of violence against women, but the mechanism has proven ineffective. According to official statistics, 968 femicides were recorded in 2022; some nongovernmental sources say the true number is likely much higher. The government has made some efforts to combat violence and promote gender equality, but the López Obrador administration has also cut funding for women’s services, and in 2022, as in previous years, the president frequently dismissed feminists as allies of the political opposition.Abortion has been a contentious issue in recent years. Many states reacted to Mexico City’s 2007 liberalization of abortion laws by strengthening their own criminal bans on the procedure. In a landmark ruling in September 2021, the SCJN declared laws criminalizing abortion unconstitutional, though state-by-state legislative reforms or judicial challenges will be required to give the ruling effect. As of November 2022, 11 states have decriminalized abortion.Mexico has taken steps toward equality for LGBT+ people, though significant cultural and legal barriers persist. A 2015 SCJN decision overruled state laws defining the purpose of marriage as procreation. Legislators in the states of Guerrero and Tamaulipas voted to legalize same-sex marriage in October 2022, becoming the last of Mexico’s 32 states to do so. As of August 2022, 19 states allow gender changes on identification documents.",2,"Economic opportunity is limited in Mexico, which maintains a high rate of economic inequality. Migrant agricultural workers face brutally exploitative conditions in several northern states. In 2018, the SCJN ruled that Mexico’s millions of domestic workers—the vast majority of whom are women—must be incorporated into the formal sector and receive social security and health benefits. The López Obrador administration has increased some forms of redistributive spending, and in recent years has sharply increased Mexico’s minimum wage.Mexico is a major source, transit, and destination country for trafficking in persons, including women and children, many of whom are subject to forced labor and sexual exploitation. Organized criminal gangs are heavily involved in human trafficking in Mexico and into the United States. This danger has been exacerbated since 2019 by the United States’ denial of entry to migrants and asylum seekers, which has forced thousands of migrants to wait in dangerous nearby cities, as well as by the economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.",2
micronesia,"Freedom of movement is generally respected. Under the CFA, Micronesians are free to travel to the United States without visas for residence, education, and employment.

Most travel restrictions had been lifted by August 2022, when the FSM fully reopened its international borders.",4,"Property rights are protected by law, and individuals are able to operate private businesses; most such enterprises are small and family-owned in practice. Property and business rights are somewhat restricted for foreigners. Noncitizens are legally prohibited from owning land, and a number of regulations limit the kinds of businesses that they can own and operate.",3,"Personal social freedoms are largely protected. However, there are no specific laws against spousal rape, and both rape and domestic violence are rarely prosecuted due to societal inhibitions against reporting such crimes. The FSM’s first support center for survivors of gender-based violence opened in Chuuk in 2020.",3,"Forced labor is prohibited, and the government enforces basic standards for working conditions in the formal sector. Foreign migrant workers nevertheless remain vulnerable to exploitative labor practices, including on foreign fishing vessels in FSM waters.

moldova,"The law protects freedom of internal movement and foreign travel, and the government generally respects these rights. There are no formal restrictions on the right to change one’s place of employment or education, but bribery is common in educational institutions. Travel to Transnistria is subject to checks by the de facto territorial authorities.",3,"Although Moldovan law guarantees property rights, they are undermined by a weak and corrupt judiciary. Widespread corruption also affects fair competition and normal business activity. Allies of powerful individuals have been accused of benefiting economically from selective enforcement of business regulations.",2,"Most personal social freedoms are protected, but domestic violence and sexual abuse are common. A 2016 report by several Moldovan NGOs found that more than 63 percent of women and girls over the age of 15 had experienced some form of gender-based violence in their lifetime, while over 20 percent of men admitted to having had nonconsensual sex with a woman. Domestic and gender-based violence laws are inadequately enforced. Abuses that do not result in significant injury are subject only to administrative penalties.Sexual harassment in the workplace remains common, and such incidents are inadequately addressed. In 2021, Parliament ratified the CoE’s Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women.Child marriages are reported in the Romany community. Neither marriage nor civil unions for same-sex couples are legally recognized.",2,"Due to weak protection of labor rights by authorities and trade unions, reports of exploitative labor practices—including long work hours, low wages, and fully or partially undocumented work or wages—are common. The rural population, women, and Roma are especially vulnerable to these practices. Regulations meant to prevent exploitative or unsafe working conditions are poorly enforced. Human trafficking remains a problem, though the authorities do attempt to prosecute traffickers.",2

However, obtaining government approval to start a business is often a lengthy and complex process, and related costs can be prohibitively expensive.",3,"Personal social freedoms are generally respected. Abortion remains illegal except under special circumstances, including rape and a risk to the pregnant person’s life or physical health. In 2019, however, the parliament passed legislation that removed criminal punishments for people who undergo abortions; health professionals could still face penalties for performing an abortion in Monaco. Also in 2019, the parliament adopted a law allowing civil partnerships for all couples, including those of the same sex. Domestic violence is outlawed in Monaco, and there are few reported incidents. The government and NGOs provide a network of support services for victims of domestic violence.",4,Legal protections against labor exploitation are adequately enforced.,4
mongolia,"The government respects freedom of movement. Exit bans imposed on individuals involved in legal cases are overseen by the courts.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought some temporary restrictions on domestic movements, but perhaps more significantly has severely reduced air travel, including restricting Mongolians’ ability to return to the country from abroad. These restrictions were lifted in 2022.",4,"People are generally free to own property and establish private businesses, though SOEs play a prominent role in some sectors. Corruption also hampers many private business activities. Officials have reportedly withheld operating licenses and other documentation from businesses until bribes are paid. There is a history of corruption and government interference in the mining industry.",3,"Individual rights on personal-status issues such as marriage and divorce are protected by law. However, domestic violence remains a problem. The government has initiated programs to encourage better police responses to domestic violence complaints in recent years. A government survey conducted with the United Nations (UN) and published in 2018 found that nearly a third of women faced physical or sexual abuse from a partner. Just 10 percent of those who had suffered severe sexual violence by a nonpartner reported the crimes to the authorities. Sexual harassment is not explicitly restricted and is widespread. An April 2022 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women noted that progress had been made in the prevention of violence against women but also urged a wider definition of such violence beyond domestic violence and further harmonization of domestic laws and with international standards.",3,"The government has struggled to cope with economic inequality, particularly as large numbers of rural Mongolians migrate to cities that lack sufficient housing and infrastructure. Their situation has become even more precarious as the capital of Ulaanbaatar has restricted the registration of new residents in an effort to curb winter-time air pollution.Women, children, people living in poverty, and other vulnerable segments of the population are at some risk of becoming trafficking victims, and can be compelled to engage in sex work, forced labor, or begging. Mine workers are subject to exploitative conditions, as are contract workers from China. The government has made efforts to better prosecute trafficking cases, but corruption and a lack of will to address the issue impede progress.",2

morocco,"Moroccan law guarantees freedom of movement and the ability to change one’s place of employment or education, but in practice poor economic conditions and corruption limit these rights. Widespread bribery, nepotism, and misconduct within the educational sector constrain merit-based advancement.",2,"Well over a third of the land is collectively owned by tribes and managed by the Interior Ministry, and in recent years it has been subject to private development without fair compensation to previous occupants. Moreover, under tribal rules of inheritance, women cannot hold the rights to occupy and use such lands, leaving them more vulnerable to displacement. Ordinary inheritance rules also put women at a disadvantage, generally granting them half the property of an equivalent male heir.Private business activity is hampered in part by the dominant role of the king, his family, and the Makhzen. Among other assets, Mohammed VI has a majority stake in Al Mada, a massive holding company with stakes in virtually every economic sector, including mining, tourism, food, banking, construction, and energy.",2,"The 2004 family code granted women increased rights in the areas of marriage, divorce, and child custody, though a number of inequities and restrictions remain, and implementation of the code has been uneven.All extramarital sexual activity is illegal, which deters rape survivors from bringing charges, among other repercussions.Domestic violence is rarely reported or punished due to social stigma, though Moroccan NGOs offer support to domestic-violence survivors. A 2018 law criminalized domestic violence and forced marriage, and imposed more stringent penalties on those convicted of rape. Although the law was considered a step forward, critics faulted the legislation for failing to outlaw spousal rape, not providing a clear definition of domestic violence, and not mandating the government to provide greater support for survivors. Abortion is legal only when the mother’s life is at risk. In September 2022, a 14-year-old girl died following a clandestine abortion performed at the house of a man accused of sexually assaulting her, leading to protests calling for abortion to be decriminalized.",2,"Poverty is widespread, and economic opportunities are scarce for a large portion of the population. Child laborers, especially girls working as domestic helpers, are denied basic rights and are frequently abused by their employers. A 2018 labor law meant to protect young women employed as household workers requires employers to use written contracts, sets a minimum working age of 18 (after a five-year phase-in period during which 16- and 17-year-olds are allowed to work), mandates a day off each week, and sets a minimum wage. Rights groups criticized the legislation for failing to provide support to reintegrate domestic workers into society, and for permitting girls under 18 to work until 2023.A 2016 law criminalized human trafficking; existing measures had defined and banned only some forms of trafficking and left many victims unprotected. Immigrant laborers, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, are often employed informally and subject to significant exploitation.",1
mozambique,"Although Mozambicans face no formal restrictions on domestic or international travel, movement is hampered by the presence of checkpoints manned by corrupt police officials, who often harass and demand bribes from travelers. Hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans have been displaced due to the ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado Province. According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), as of November 2022, there were over one million IDPs in Mozambique, mostly from Cabo Delgado. Authorities in Nampula and Niassa have also asked for help managing the displaced population. Despite continued conflict, a relative improvement in security had allowed an increasing number of IDPs to return to their place of origin by year’s end.",3,"The law does not recognize private property outside urbanized areas; citizens instead obtain land use rights from the government. Many citizens are uninformed about the land law and fail to properly register their holdings. The government must approve all formal transfers of land use rights in an often opaque and protracted process. As a result, most land transactions occur on an extralegal market.There is no legal restriction to private business. However, businesspeople do face kidnappings and extortion. Under customary law, women usually cannot inherit property. The government does not frequently intervene to protect women’s property rights when inheritance is denied.",2,"Domestic violence is pervasive in Mozambique and laws against it are infrequently enforced. Early and forced marriages remain common in rural areas. Mozambique has historically possessed one of the world’s highest rates of child marriage, though in 2019 the government passed legislation closing a loophole that previously allowed the practice. Children and women have been especially impacted by ongoing violence in Cabo Delgado. Insurgents have kidnapped children to be used as soldiers, and women are being captured as sexual slaves.",2,"Many women and girls from rural areas are at risk of becoming drawn into sex trafficking and domestic servitude. Government efforts to confront trafficking are improving but remain inadequate, according to the US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report. Child labor is permitted for children between 15 and 17 years old with a government permit. However, children under 15 frequently labor in the agriculture, mining, and fishing sectors, where they often work long hours and do not attend school. Many observers note that the government’s 2017 plan of action to address the high number of children who are employed has been ineffective.",2
myanmar,"Following the 2021 coup, movement has been increasingly restricted across the country. The military erected roadblocks and checkpoints; enforced exit controls, curfews, and residency rules for private dwellings that require reporting overnight guests; and engaged in violent raids of neighborhoods and villages. Some high-profile dissidents have been arrested as they attempted to leave Myanmar by air, while thousands more have fled to neighboring countries by land despite the dangers posed by military forces. Restrictions were further tightened by an April 2022 decree requiring a national registration card to travel or stay somewhere outside one’s home.Additionally, Myanmar’s large population of stateless residents remain subject to significant restrictions on their movement, particularly the 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State and are confined to designated camps and villages; those who attempt to travel outside these areas are regularly detained.",0,"Disputes over land-grabbing and business projects that violate human rights are common. Myanmar’s property-transfer laws prohibit transfers to or from a foreigner except in certain state-approved cases of inheritance and require registration of foreign-owned property. Stateless residents, including the Rohingya, cannot legally buy or sell property or set up a business.Instances of forced eviction and displacement, confiscation, lack of sufficient compensation, and direct violence against landholders by state security officials abound. Court cases are frequently brought against farmers for trespassing on land that was taken from them. The resumption of armed hostilities following the coup involved military attacks and arbitrary destruction of property in 2022, including the leveling of entire villages. Rohingya land and property are consistently razed, confiscated, appropriated, or built on, often with the direct involvement of the military, and sometimes under the guise of development assistance.",1,"Legal restrictions require Buddhist women submit an application to marry non-Buddhist men. Laws that might protect women from domestic abuse and rape are weak and poorly enforced, and such violence is an acute and persistent problem. The army has a record of using rape as a weapon of war against ethnic minority women, and security personnel typically enjoy impunity for sexual violence. Following the 2021 coup, numerous instances of gender-based violence were reported by detainees.",1,"Human trafficking, forced labor, child labor, and the recruitment of child soldiers are serious problems in Myanmar. Child soldiers are enlisted by the military and ethnic rebel groups, which also recruit civilians for forced labor. Various commercial and other interests continue to use forced labor despite a formal ban on the practice. Trafficking victims include women and girls subjected to forced sex work and domestic servitude, as well as women who are sold as brides to men in China—an expanding practice in some ethnic minority states. People displaced by ongoing conflicts are especially vulnerable, and such forms of sexual and labor exploitation increased following the coup. In July 2022, the World Bank estimated that the coup had caused 40 percent of the country’s population to live in poverty, wiping out the previous decade’s improvements in economic growth and poverty reduction amid worsening economic inequality.

namibia,"Freedom of movement is constitutionally guaranteed and generally observed in practice. However, it was restricted when authorities imposed COVID-19-related restrictions when a state of emergency was declared in March 2020.The illegal fencing of communal land, condemned by the Commission of Inquiry into Ancestral Land Rights in January 2021, and its impact on freedom of movement and access to resources found in communal areas remains a challenge. In September 2022, President Geingob registered his concern with traditional leaders over this corrupt and illegal practice and urged them to address it. In March 2022, the Supreme Court directed a government ministry to reconsider an appeal for residency rights from a member of a same-sex couple. The applicant claimed that he should not need a visa when entering the country because he permanently resides there with his same-sex partner, whom he married outside of Namibia.",3,"Private property rights are guaranteed in law and largely respected in practice. The constitution prohibits expropriation without compensation. There are no legal barriers to women’s access to land. However, customs regarding inheritance procedures and property rights limit women.Land rights remain a contentious and unresolved issue. The Commission of Inquiry into Ancestral Land Rights and Restitution presented its report to President Geingob in July 2020. The Indigenous Hai//om group sued the government in an effort to gain recognition for its ancestral rights to land in Etosha National Park, but ultimately lost on appeal in the Supreme Court in March 2022. In June, the Land Reform Ministry rejected the Affirmative Repositioning (AR) movement’s petition calling for a ban on foreign nationals owning land; the ministry reported that it had plans draft legislation on the issue.",3,"Same-sex marriages are not recognized, and many churches have in the past indicated their unwillingness to recognize or perform them. In January 2022 the High Court ruled against two same-sex couples seeking legal recognition of their marriages concluded outside of Namibia, but the court acknowledged that they had been discriminated against. In another case, the Supreme Court directed the government to reconsider the residency application of a same-sex couple living in Namibia.Rates of gender-based violence (GBV) and rape of minors are high. In September 2022, parliament passed the Combating of Domestic Violence Amendment Act, which was criticized for excluding same-sex couples. The Combating of Rape Amendment Act, which introduces harsher sentences for rape, was promulgated in October. Namibia lacks appropriate cybercrime and data protection laws to address online GBV.Abortion is only available for those in medical danger and for survivors of rape and incest. Forced and child marriages occur; 7 percent of girls are married before turning 18.

However, forced child labor is prevalent in the agricultural sector and in domestic settings. San and Zemba children are especially at risk. Human trafficking remains a challenge. In April 2022 police reported a syndicate had smuggled 26 Namibian women to Oman. In September, a Congolese national was sentenced to three years in prison for smuggling migrants into Namibia. The US State Department reported in its 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report that Namibia fully met minimum antitrafficking standards.",2
nauru,"Most people in Nauru are free to move around the island. However, while asylum seekers were granted freedom of movement across the island in 2015, there are limits on their ability to leave, and they face significant difficulties in obtaining employment and education. Many asylum seekers had lived in tents and converted storage containers at the processing center, where they were under heavy surveillance. In 2018, the aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) was asked by Nauru officials to stop providing care for asylum seekers, and the group subsequently left the country. In the days afterward, MSF condemned conditions for the asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru and claimed they had been forced out.The government has withheld the passports of some political opponents in recent years, including at least three people associated with the Nauru 19, among them two former opposition lawmakers. These two opposition lawmakers blame the government for the death of former president and Nauru 19 member Sprent Dabwido. Legal action, filed in 2019 by the two former lawmakers, claims that the Nauruan government delayed returning Dabwido his passport, preventing him from receiving treatment for cancer in Australia in time to be cured.To prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into the country, Nauruan stopped most international flights landing in Nauru in 2020 and imposed quarantine requirements for most international arrivals, except for those arriving from a regularly updated list of “safe countries” deemed to have sufficiently low levels of COVID-19 in their respective populations. Other movement restrictions, including curfews, were enforced with strict punishments. In June 2022, amid the country’s first outbreak of the virus, arriving flights from abroad were banned. These restrictions eased in August, although other restrictions (including mandatory mask wearing) remained.",3,"The constitution protects the right to own property and people in Nauru freely establish businesses.

In 2020, the government simplified the process for victims of domestic violence to obtain safety and protection orders against their abusers. The government of Nauru also announced then that it would introduce harsher laws for sex offenders, including by reducing the ability of sex offenders to receive bail and introducing laws that prevent the age of the perpetrator a mitigating factor in sex offences. Marital rape is a criminal offense.Same-sex marriage is not recognized by law.

nepal,"Freedom of movement is generally respected in Nepal. There are legal limits on the rights of refugees to move freely, but restrictions are rarely enforced. Citizens generally enjoy choice of residence, though bribery is common in the housing market as well as the university admittance process. In rural areas, some women remain subject to chhaupadi, a traditional practice in which menstruating women are physically separated from their families and communities. The practice was criminalized in 2018, and arrests have occurred inconsistently since then.",3,"Although citizens have the right to own private businesses, starting a business in Nepal often requires bribes to a wide range of officials. Women face widespread discrimination when starting businesses, and customs and border police are notoriously corrupt in dealing with cross-border trade. Foreigners generally cannot own land, though in practice individuals, businesses and organizations have found ways around this rule with long term leases of properties technically owned by Nepalis. In 2022, Nepal’s finance ministry stated that foreigners will soon be able to buy apartments in buildings that have at least 100 units.",2,"Gender-based violence remains a problem and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2009 Domestic Violence Act provides for monetary compensation and psychological treatment for victims, but authorities rarely prosecute domestic violence cases, which are sometimes handled informally.Underage marriage, especially of girls, remains common. Foreign men married to Nepali women must wait 15 years to obtain naturalized citizenship, while foreign women married to Nepali men can immediately become citizens. Children of foreign-born fathers and Nepali mothers must apply for naturalized citizenship, while children of foreign-born mothers and Nepali fathers are automatically granted citizenship. In June 2020, a parliamentary committee endorsed an amendment to the Citizenship Act that would require foreign-born wives to wait seven years before attaining their own citizenship. In July 2022, a proposed amendment to the Citizenship Act would have granted citizenship to foreign women married to Nepali men once they initiated the process to give up their existing citizenship, but didn’t pass.",2,"Trafficking of children and women from Nepal for prostitution in India still happens with some regularity, and police rarely intervene.

According to Human Rights Collective Nicaragua Never Again, 716 femicides occurred between 2010 and 2020. Another organization, Catholics for the Right to Decide, reported 67 femicides in 2022.	The 2012 Comprehensive Law against Violence toward Women and subsequent amendments have had little effect on gender-based violence. It also allows for mediation between the perpetrator and victim of sexual violence, despite concerns from rights groups.	Abortion is illegal and punishable by imprisonment, even when performed to save the pregnant person’s life or in cases of rape or incest. Medical practitioners and people who get abortions can be punished with eight-year prison sentences.",2,"Nicaragua is a source country for women and children forced into prostitution; adults and children are also vulnerable to forced labor. In the 2022 edition of its Trafficking in Persons Report, the US State Department reported that the government did little to eliminate human trafficking, though authorities did secure convictions against four people during its reporting period. However, the department also noted that Nicaraguan authorities “continued to downplay the severity of the trafficking problem” and offered insufficient resources or shelter to survivors.",2
niger,"The constitution guarantees freedom of movement, but this is hampered by militant activity and bribery by security officials who guard checkpoints.",2,"Several complications undermine legal guarantees of the right to own property. Few people hold formal ownership documents for their land, though customary law provides some protection. The enforcement of both state and customary law often gives way to tension and confusion. Women have less access to land ownership than men due to inheritance practices and inferior status in property disputes.",2,"Family law gives women inferior status in divorce proceedings. Female genital mutilation (FGM) was criminalized in 2003 and has declined, but it continues among a small percentage of the population. Penalties for rape are heavy, but societal attitudes and victims’ fears of retribution discourage reporting, and when rape is reported it is often poorly investigated. Domestic violence is not explicitly criminalized, though women may lodge criminal allegations of battery against partners. Some cases have resulted in convictions, but reporting is similarly discouraged in practice.",1,"Although slavery was criminalized in 2003 and banned in the 2010 constitution, it remains a problem in Niger. Estimates of the number of enslaved people vary widely but is generally counted in the tens of thousands. Niger remains a source, transit point, and destination for human trafficking. There has been a worrying in the number of youth being forced to work as beggars in major cities in recent years.",1
nigeria,"While the freedom of movement is legally guaranteed, security officials frequently impose dusk-to-dawn curfews and other movement restrictions in areas affected by communal violence or militant activities. Railway services between Abuja and Kaduna were suspended for eight months following the armed attack on a train traveling between the two cities in March 2022. In April, the government eased most remaining COVID-19 restrictions, including lifting a nationwide curfew. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that nearly 2.5 million people in northeast Nigeria were internally displaced as of July 2022.",1,"Nigeria’s poorly regulated property rights system hinders citizens and private businesses from engaging in the efficient and legal purchase or sale of property, including land. Bribery is a common practice when starting a business and registering property. Women belonging to certain ethnic groups are often denied equal rights to inherit property due to customary laws and practices.However, the climate for private enterprise in recent years has benefited from advancements in credit accessibility, ease of starting a business, ease of paying taxes, and property registration.The property rights of Fulani and of farmers are affected by violence as Fulani travel south to find new grazing lands. Herding groups’ grazing lands have been used for cultivation, while Fulani herders have been observed expropriating farmers’ land and crops.

Boko Haram’s attacks on women’s rights have been particularly egregious, with victims often subjected to forced marriage and rape, among other acts.Abortion is illegal unless the life of the mother is in danger. As a result, many women seek out dangerous illegal abortions, finding themselves at risk of medical complications. Women who face such complications often do not receive further medical treatment.",1,"Nigerian organized crime groups are heavily involved in human trafficking. Boko Haram has subjected children to forced labor and sex slavery. Both Boko Haram and a civilian vigilante group that opposes the militants have forcibly recruited child soldiers, according to the US State Department.Meanwhile, implementation of the 2003 Child Rights Act, which protects children from sexual exploitation and other abuses, remains uneven; at the end of 2022, two northern states had not implemented the legislation, though they were in the process of doing so.The US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report noted that Nigeria “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.” The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) continues to rescue trafficking survivors and prosecute some suspected traffickers, but its funding is reportedly inadequate and labor traffickers face few prosecutions. Survivors often find their freedom of movement withheld by NAPTIP in poorly managed shelters and experience discrimination when seeking access to public services after their release.",1
north-korea,"Citizens have no freedom of movement, and forced internal resettlement is routine. Emigration is illegal. In recent years, authorities have employed stricter domestic controls to arrest the flow of defectors, who have also been impeded by regional coronavirus-related travel restrictions. The South Korean Unification Ministry reported that over 1,000 defectors entered the country in 2019 but only 67 did so in 2022.The regime implemented strict pandemic-containment measures and border controls in 2020. Authorities imposed new virus-related lockdowns in May 2022 and imposed local restrictions near the Chinese border in August. Internal movement was proscribed in September to limit the spread of “seasonal flu.” In November, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that North Korea had tightened security along the Chinese border since the global pandemic began in 2020. Some rail traffic with China and Russia was observed during the year, however. A person’s songbun classification affects their place of residence as well as employment and educational opportunities, access to medical facilities, and even access to stores. All foreign travel is strictly controlled by the regime. Freedom of movement for foreigners is also limited and subject to arbitrary constraints.Most North Korean workers cannot freely choose their employment, with the government assigning men and unmarried women to their positions and often denying monetary compensation.

A lack of infrastructure, scarcity of energy and raw materials, lingering foreign debt, and ideological isolation also hobble business activity in the country.Informal and government-approved private markets and service industries have provided many North Koreans, especially women, a growing field of activity that is somewhat free from government control. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has hampered access to goods to sell in those markets, limiting people’s ability to earn discretionary income and increasing dependence on domestic food production and distribution.Local officials have had some discretion in the management of special economic zones and over small-scale experiments with market-oriented economic policies.",1,"Men and women have formal equality in personal status matters such as marriage and divorce. However, sexual and physical violence against women is common, and victims have little legal recourse. There are no specific legal penalties for domestic violence. UN bodies have noted the use of forced abortions on pregnant women when forcibly repatriated from China and infanticide of half-Chinese children.",1,"Forced labor is common in prison camps, mass mobilization programs, and state-run contracting arrangements in which North Korean workers are sent abroad. Human trafficking networks, sometimes operating with the assistance of government officials, target North Korean women; those ensnared are subject to sex slavery and forced marriages, often in China. Some women have also turned to prostitution to survive in recent years and are exploited by their employers and the police.Economic opportunities are also hampered by international sanctions imposed in response to North Korea’s continued nuclear pursuits. Since 2016, sanctions have targeted civilian industries including textiles and seafood. North Korea has also been cut off from the international banking system. While this has not deterred North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, it has created growing difficulties for those dependent on markets and quasi-private businesses.",1

However, the legal changes have been delayed in the parliament due to a lack of support from several political actors.",2,"Laws do not impose rigid barriers to social mobility, though rampant corruption can effectively hamper upward income mobility. Though the government’s 2018–22 economic formalization strategy has proven somewhat successful in addressing informal employment, the country’s informal economy remains large, leaving many workers vulnerable to employer abuse. The Assembly amended the labor code and minimum-wage legislation in January 2022, raising the minimum wage to 18,000 denar (around $300) per month. Sunday was declared a nonworking day, ensuring some workers’ rights.Workers in the garment industry lack protections and are vulnerable to mistreatment. A 2022 study that featured data from seven regions found that around 1,000 textile workers were being paid less than the guaranteed 18,000 denar minimum wage. Human trafficking remains a problem. The government has taken steps to better identify trafficking victims, notably at government-run transit centers that house migrants and refugees.

The US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report notes that though Norwegian authorities make significant efforts to fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, they do not report official numbers of identified and assisted victims and have not developed formal identification procedures for trafficking victims. Authorities have also focused on the undocumented status off migrants who are potentially being trafficked, penalizing the victims rather than the people who were exploiting the trafficked individuals. In July 2022, the Transparency Law went into force, requiring companies to assess their own operations and supply chains’ compliance with human rights obligations. The law is intended to prevent corporations from being complicit in economic exploitation and human rights violations domestically and abroad, and to provide consumers with access to information based on companies’ human rights impact.",4

Omani women who marry foreigners cannot transmit citizenship to their spouses or children. Omani law does not specifically address domestic violence and sexual harassment or criminalize spousal rape, while extramarital sex is criminalized. Women who report rape have at times been prosecuted for engaging in extramarital sex, if authorities do not believe they were assaulted. A woman must have a male guardian—usually a father—to contract her into marriage, and women are at disadvantage under laws governing matters such as divorce and child custody. The 2018 penal code included a new provision that criminalized the wearing of women’s clothing by men.",1,"Oman’s labor policies put migrant workers at a severe disadvantage and effectively encourage exploitation. Household workers, who are not covered by the labor law, are especially at risk of abuse by employers. The government has pursued an “Omanization” process to replace foreign workers with native Omanis. Among other tactics, temporary visa bans for foreign workers in various professions have been issued or extended since 2013. In 2021, the Ministry of Labor announced plans to bar expatriates from certain private-sector occupations, which would only be open to Omani citizens.Despite a 2008 antitrafficking law and some recent efforts to improve enforcement, authorities have not always proactively identified or protected human trafficking victims, particularly among migrant and household workers.

Gradual social change has also eroded the power of wealthy landowning families involved in such exploitation. Nevertheless, other traditional forms of extreme labor exploitation remain common. Employers continue to use chronic indebtedness to restrict laborers’ rights and hold actual earnings well below prescribed levels, particularly among sharecroppers and in the brick-kiln industry.

A 2017 law guarantees household workers a maximum 10-hour working day, one rest day a week, three weeks of annual leave, and an end-of-service payment, among other provisions. A 2020 reform established a monthly minimum wage of 1,000 riyals ($275) for all workers, regardless of sector or nationality. Authorities introduced a nondiscriminatory minimum wage in March 2021—the first in the region.

Migrant workers who built the infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup were subjected to serious human rights violations; according to the Guardian, as many as 6,500 workers died in the 10-year period leading up to the tournament. Workers reportedly faced brutal working conditions, pervasive debt bondage, unsanitary living conditions, and wage theft. Additionally, in the run-up to the World Cup, thousands of migrant workers were reportedly evicted from apartment buildings, some with as little as two hours’ notice.",1

In March 2022, the government issued rules that speed up the expropriation process for public development projects included in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.",2,"While personal social freedoms are generally protected, domestic violence remains a serious problem, and laws meant to combat it are poorly enforced. Same-sex marriages are not permitted under Romanian law.

russia,"The government restricts freedoms of movement and residence. Adults must carry internal passports while traveling and to obtain many government services. Some regional authorities impose registration rules that limit the right of citizens to choose their place of residence, typically targeting members of ethnic minorities and migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asia.Russians have emigrated in large numbers after the invasion of Ukraine began. In May 2022, the FSB reported that 3.9 million people left in the first calendar quarter, though stated reasons included tourism and private business. More left after the partial mobilization was announced in September, with 700,000 leaving within two weeks of the announcement according to Forbes Russia. Some who tried to flee during the mobilization drive were met by security personnel who delivered conscription notices at border points.Employees of the military and security services were banned from foreign travel in 2014. Following the September 2022 mobilization, reservists in many regions were prohibited from leaving their home districts, and men who received mobilization summons were refused passports. Authorities launched raids to locate military-age men during the mobilization, including those who were ostensibly exempt. Naturalized citizens who are considered opponents of the war also face restrictions; in November, Putin proposed legislative amendments that would allow for the revocation of their passports.Ukrainians have been forcibly sent to Russia in large numbers. In August 2022, Interfax reported that over 3.4 million Ukrainians, including 556,000 children, were in Russia. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, meanwhile, said 2.9 million Ukrainian refugees were in Russia in October. In September, the United Nations accused Moscow of forcing Ukrainian children into Russia with the aim of facilitating their adoptions there.In late October, Putin approved an order imposing movement restrictions in several regions in Russia proper and Crimea.",1,"State power and private property are intimately connected, with senior officials often using their government positions to amass vast property holdings. State takeovers of key industries and large tax penalties imposed on select companies after dubious legal proceedings have illustrated the precarious nature of property rights under Putin’s rule, especially when political interests are involved. Private businesses more broadly are routinely targeted for extortion or expropriation by law enforcement officials and organized criminal groups.Two laws passed in July 2022 compel private businesses to supply the military with goods and services and force employees to work overtime to support the war effort.",1,"Constitutional amendments approved in 2020 define marriage as a union between a man and a woman; the changes were formally adopted in 2021, effectively barring any future law recognizing same-sex marriage.Domestic violence receives little attention from the authorities. Survivors who kill their abusers in self-defense are commonly imprisoned. A 2017 law decriminalized acts of domestic violence that do not result in permanent physical harm. The measure also relieved police of the obligation to initiate cases, transferring that burden to survivors. Over 12,000 women may have died in domestic violence incidents between 2011 and 2019 according to a 2021 report published by the Russian Consortium of Women’s NGOs.Residents of certain regions, particularly in the North Caucasus, face tighter societal restrictions on personal appearance and relationships, and some so-called honor killings have been reported. In Chechnya, Kadyrov has spoken in favor of polygamy and sought to compel divorced couples to remarry.",2,"Legal protections against labor exploitation are poorly enforced. Migrant workers are often exposed to unsafe or exploitative working conditions. Both Russians facing economic hardship and migrants to Russia from other countries are vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking. Trafficking victims are routinely detained, deported, and prosecuted for activity they were forced to participate in.As the war against Ukraine continued, Russian authorities began reaching out to employers, providing them with draft summons to deliver to particular workers. While some migrant workers have reportedly enlisted in order to receive citizenship after a “fast-track” decree was signed in September 2022, others have reportedly been manipulated into participating, as have prisoners. Individuals who do join report having to acquire their own supplies and going without promised payments. ",1

Business owners who are seen as critical of the government have sometimes faced politically motivated investigations and asset seizures. The law grants the same property and inheritance rights to men and women, though women are not always able to assert their rights in practice.",2,"The law generally grants equal rights to men and women regarding marriage and divorce, but informal marriages under customary law, including polygamous unions, lack such protections, and same-sex marriages are illegal. The penalties for spousal rape are much lighter than that for other forms of rape.

Family members of activists can also be banned from travel or imprisoned.Gender segregation restricts freedom of movement for both men and women, but male guardianship and other factors have historically imposed onerous constraints on women. The long-standing ban on women driving was lifted in 2018, and since 2019 adult women have been able to apply for a passport independently. Gender-segregation norms are easing in some places, but unevenly and informally.In 2021, the kafala visa-sponsorship system was modified so that certain foreign workers no longer need their employer’s permission to leave their job, take a new job, or leave the country; they instead need to seek permission from the Saudi government.",0,"While a great deal of business activity in the kingdom is dominated by or connected to members of the government, the ruling family, or other elite families, officials have given assurances that special industrial and commercial zones are free from interference by the royal family.Women face legal discrimination regarding property rights, with daughters typically receiving half the inheritance awarded to sons. Women are no longer legally required to obtain permission from a male guardian to apply for business licenses.",1,"There are several official restrictions on marriage. For example, Muslim women may not marry non-Muslims, citizens require the Interior Ministry’s permission to marry noncitizens, and men are barred from marrying women from certain countries. All sexual activity outside of marriage is criminalized, and the death penalty can be applied in certain circumstances. In March 2022, Saudi Arabia adopted a personal status law that codifies matters such as a divorced woman’s rights to child custody, alimony, and child support, reducing the scope of judicial discretion. It also prohibits girls under 18 from being forcibly married, and allows a woman to appeal to a court if her male guardian rejects a proposed marriage. The law nevertheless retains the system of male guardianship and leaves women at a disadvantage on a variety of topics. A 2013 law broadly defined and criminalized domestic abuse, prescribing fines and up to a year in prison for perpetrators. However, enforcement remains problematic, with some officials prioritizing privacy and family integrity over safety and justice for victims. Prosecutions are extremely rare. Women’s practical ability to leave abusive relationships is severely limited. While women are no longer legally required to live with their husbands under the 2019 reforms to the guardianship system, social taboos and other obstacles often deter them from leaving their family home. There are a limited number of shelters for women escaping abuse, but women are not allowed to leave them without their guardians’ permission.The religious police’s authority to enforce gender-segregation and personal-attire rules was sharply curtailed in law and practice in 2016.

In February 2022, authorities indicated that men would be fined for wearing shorts only if they did so in mosques or government offices.",0,"Saudi citizens generally enjoy generous welfare benefits from the government. State programs give preferential treatment to companies that hire certain percentages of Saudi citizens, while penalizing those that fail to meet such targets.Foreign workers—who make up more than half of the active labor force—enjoy limited legal protections and remain vulnerable to trafficking and forced labor, primarily through employers’ exploitation of the kafala system. They also lack pathways to become citizens and face discrimination, including lower wages. The 2021 reforms to the kafala system ended the requirement that foreign workers obtain their employer’s permission to leave the country or to take another job, a rule that had been criticized for enabling forced labor. However, foreign workers do need to obtain permission from the government to take those actions. Moreover, the changes do not apply to the nearly 3.6 million people employed as domestic workers, personal security guards, or chauffeurs, as they are governed by separate regulations that provide fewer safeguards against exploitative working conditions.",1

However, the economy remains dominated by chaebol that have colluded with political figures to pursue their own interests, and property ownership for individuals has become especially difficult due to fluctuating housing prices.",3,"Personal social freedoms are largely respected, and women and men generally have equal rights in divorce and custody matters. Abortion was decriminalized in 2021. Same-sex marriage is not legal in South Korea. Same-sex couples are not allowed to register for health insurance as spouses, with a court ruling denying benefits to a couple in January 2022.Domestic violence is prevalent despite laws meant to combat such activity; 16.1 percent of women surveyed in 2021 reported violence, emotional abuse, or other coercive behavior by intimate partners. Arrest and prosecution rates for such cases are low, while sexual offenses against women and children carry weak penalties. Foreign-born brides also suffer high rates of domestic violence.President Yoon vowed to abolish the MGEF during his presidential campaign. The MGEF currently provides services for victims of sexual and domestic abuse, support for single parents, who headed 1.5 million households as of 2020, and other “family-related projects” such as youth counseling.",3,"While protections against exploitative working conditions are enforced, foreign migrant workers, who number 480,000, remain vulnerable to illegal debt bondage and forced labor, including sex trafficking. Migrant workers’ groups have denounced the employment permit system and legislation that makes it difficult for individuals to change their employment, which can expose workers to abuses. Couriers, some of whom have died from overwork, typically lack the labor protections of full-time employees.Women in South Korea are vulnerable to recruitment by international marriage brokers and sex traffickers. Many foreign women who have suffered sexual violence face language barriers and are reluctant to come forward due to their employment status. Although the government actively prosecutes human trafficking cases, those convicted often receive light punishments. In its Trafficking in Persons Report 2022, the US State Department noted that authorities initiated fewer trafficking prosecutions than in its previous reporting period.",3
south-sudan,"The interim constitution enshrines free movement and residence, as well as the right to an education. The civil war, multiple local conflicts, and poor-to-nonexistent service delivery have made it impossible for many people to exercise these rights in practice. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said 2 million IDPs were receiving its support in South Sudan as of March 2022.",0,"Land-use and ownership disputes frequently cause conflict, and the return of refugees has exacerbated the problem. Property rights are weak and not respected in practice. Customary practices often deny women their legal rights to property and inheritance.Armed groups and influential politicians prosper through corrupt business deals and activities, including through illicit natural-resource extraction.",0,"Domestic violence is common but is not legally addressed. Rape and other forms of sexual violence have been used extensively as weapons of war against both men and women, without legal consequence for perpetrators. A UN panel of experts’ November 2022 report on the country warned that conflict-related sexual violence remained widespread.Customary law puts women at a disadvantage in matters of divorce and child custody. Forced and early marriages are common, with about half of girls marrying by age 18. Spousal rape is not a crime.",0,"Essential goods are unaffordable for ordinary people due to rampant inflation.

Trafficking in persons for forced labor and sexual exploitation is widespread. Rural women and girls, IDPs, and migrants from neighboring countries are among the most vulnerable to mistreatment. The use of child soldiers is also a serious problem. Girls have increasingly been forced to provide labor, including sex work.",0
spain,"There are few significant restrictions on individuals’ freedom to travel within the country or abroad, or to change their place of residence, employment, or education. However, the authorities have been criticized for failing to grant documented asylum seekers free movement within Spanish territory, despite multiple court rulings on the matter.",4,"The legal framework supports property rights, and there are no major restrictions on private business activity.",4,"Personal social freedoms are generally respected. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Spain since 2005, and same-sex couples may adopt children. In December 2022, the Congress of Deputies passed a bill allowing people aged 16 or older to change the gender on their official documents without a medical diagnosis or proof of hormone treatment. The bill, which had yet to win Senate approval at year’s end, would also ban so-called conversion therapies.There are legal protections against domestic abuse and rape, including spousal rape; while both remain problems in practice, the government and civil society groups work actively to combat them. A law that took effect in October 2022 defined rape as nonconsensual sex, eliminating the need to show that the crime featured physical violence or intimidation, but critics denounced an unintentional loophole that allowed people convicted under the old law to apply for reduced sentences. Abortion is legal but can be difficult to access in practice: in five of Spain’s 17 autonomous regions, no public hospital offers the procedure.",4,"Residents generally have access to economic opportunity and protection from exploitative working conditions. Despite strong antitrafficking efforts by law enforcement agencies, however, migrant workers remain vulnerable to debt bondage, forced labor, and sexual exploitation.The government continued to increase the country’s minimum wage in 2022, aiming to raise the figure to 60 percent of the average salary in Spain by the end of 2023 as part of an effort to reduce the level of income inequality in the country, which is among the worst in the European Union.",3
sri-lanka,"Free movement is restricted by security checkpoints, restricted military areas, and military occupation of public and private land. Security checkpoints erected in Northern Province after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president have been mostly dismantled, though Tamil areas remain under surveillance. Women with children younger than five years old are not allowed to travel abroad for work. Access to educational institutions is impeded by corruption, with bribes often required to obtain primary school admission.",2,"Ongoing occupations and other forms of land grabbing remain serious problems, especially for Tamils in the northeast. Members of minority groups have been targeted by criminals using forged land deeds in Colombo, leading to an investigation in October 2022. Corruption sometimes hinders the effective enforcement of property rights in general. Some women face gender-based disadvantages regarding inheritance under the customary laws of their ethnic or religious group, and Muslims reportedly encounter discrimination in property transactions.",2,"Although women have equal rights under civil and criminal law, matters related to the family—including marriage, divorce, and child custody—are adjudicated under the customary laws of each ethnic or religious group, and the application of these laws sometimes entails discrimination against women. Rape of women and children and domestic violence remain serious problems, and perpetrators often act with impunity. Some very young girls are forced into marriages under Islamic personal law, which the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government sought to change by altering the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA). However, the government was criticized for attempting to revise the MMDA without adequate input from the Muslim community. In 2021, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama objected to the cabinet’s decision to amend the MMDA, in part because it would ban polygamous marriages for Muslims.",2,"Although the government has increased penalties for employing minors, many children continue to work as household servants and face abuse from employers. Women and children in certain communities are vulnerable to forced sex work.

In the 2022 edition of its Trafficking in Persons Report, the US State Department noted that the government was making significant attempts to address human trafficking and to implement a 2021–25 antitrafficking action plan. However, prosecutions of traffickers and sentences for those convicted were reported as insufficient.

While most of the mainly Tamil workers on tea plantations are unionized, employers routinely violate their rights. Migrant workers recruited in Sri Lanka are often exposed to exploitative labor conditions abroad.",2

The April 2021 La Soufrière volcanic eruption caused significant displacement, especially in the north. Over 13,300 people were displaced. In April 2022, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reported that more than 100 homes remained uninhabitable.Public sector employment was affected by a government mandate requiring some workers to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, which was announced in October 2021 and took effect that December. It was reported that over 500 workers lost their jobs after refusing to comply with the mandate. In March 2022, the High Court allowed those dismissed to file a lawsuit against the state.

The government has actively encouraged investors to do business in the country, though there are some regulatory difficulties.",4,"Individual rights with respect to personal status matters like marriage and divorce are generally protected by law, though same-sex marriage is not recognized. The Domestic Violence Act of 2015, which went into effect in 2016 and provides for protective orders, offers some tools and resources to victims of domestic violence. However, such violence remains a serious and widespread problem, as does sexual assault.",3,"The law provides safety and other basic protections against labor exploitation, and these are typically upheld, though there are some reports of inadequate enforcement. The Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act of 2011 criminalizes forced labor and sex trafficking, and the government has increased its efforts to investigate violations and improve prevention and victim protection, but it has yet to secure any trafficking convictions.",3
sudan,"The 2019 interim constitution affirms freedom of movement and the right to travel—including overseas—for all citizens, but these rights are still impeded in practice by state security forces and other armed groups across the country, including those engaged in clashes between ethnic communities. Most of the more than 3.7 million IDPs in Sudan (as of July 2022) were concentrated in the long-standing conflict areas of Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile States.In 2020, the transitional government abolished the need for exit permits, as well as a rule that had required women to obtain permission from a male guardian to travel abroad with children.In 2022, the government began to limit the movement of people in some of the states affected by intercommunal conflicts. Several reports indicate that the decision has mostly affected already vulnerable and marginalized communities.",1,"Weak land rights have been a chronic driver of conflict in Sudan. In a succession of opaque deals, al-Bashir’s regime leased large parcels of arable land to foreign countries for export crop production. In some cases, local populations were forced from their land or had their water supplies depleted.The 2019 interim constitution guarantees the right to own property and protects citizens from expropriation by the state without compensation. The government has stated its intention to address land-related grievances, but property seizures by security forces and communal conflicts over land rights continue to be reported.Women are denied equal rights to property and inheritance under laws based on Sharia (Islamic law) and through discriminatory customary practices.",1,"Although the transitional government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in April 2021, it failed to endorse provisions recognizing equality in marriage, divorce, and parenting, which Sharia-based laws deny women. Among other restrictions, a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man.In 2019, the transitional government repealed the Public Order Act, which had been used in part to punish women for dress or behavior deemed indecent. However, the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, an Indigenous African women’s rights advocacy group, reported in September 2021 that women continued to be punished for “morality transgressions.”Sexual violence against women remains a major problem. A UN report released in August 2021 claimed there were high numbers of incidents of domestic and sexual violence in households; family sexual violence against women, in informal jobs, displaced and refugee women outside of camps, children in Quranic schools, and people with disabilities; forced, arranged, and child marriages; female genital mutilation (FGM); and restricted access to financial resources and educational opportunities. In 2020, the transitional government criminalized FGM.",1,"Bleak economic conditions, mass unemployment, and high prices for basic goods were among the root causes of the revolution that helped topple al-Bashir’s regime in 2019. Prime Minister Hamdok’s government voiced a commitment to reversing these trends. In 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 12-month program to support the government in its efforts to eliminate large fuel subsidies, increase spending for health and social programs, increase its tax base, reduce corruption, and improve the business environment. Though the country officially met the requirements to receive debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) in June 2021, international financial institutions paused assistance to the Sudanese government after the October 2021 coup, including $500 million from the World Bank and $150 million from the IMF.

The transitional government took early steps to clamp down on hazardous practices and working conditions in the gold-mining sector. Migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and IDPs remain especially vulnerable to exploitation, including by criminal networks engaged in human trafficking. Some armed groups in the country have allegedly recruited children as fighters. In August 2021, the Sudanese government launched the 2021–23 National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking.",0

Corruption, especially regarding land policy, government contracts, and licensing, can hinder private business activity. Indigenous and other minority groups face illegal land expropriation, including by illegal logging and mining operations.Indigenous peoples and Maroons’ traditional land rights are not guaranteed by law. A draft bill to regulate collective rights was introduced in 2020 but was not decided upon in 2022. Women face inequality related to inheritance and property due to discriminatory cultural customs.",2,"Individuals are generally free of undue constraints on personal status decisions such as marriage and divorce, though those decisions are impacted by cultural forces. Despite efforts of the Santokhi government to address it, gender-based violence remains a serious problem; laws that criminalize it are not well enforced.",3,"Despite continuous government efforts to combat it, human trafficking remains a serious problem. Corruption has facilitated traffickers’ criminal activities.Women and migrant workers are especially at risk of sexual exploitation and forced labor in various industries. Construction and mining work often receives inadequate attention from labor inspectors.The deteriorating economy in Venezuela has increased the vulnerability of Venezuelan women to sex trafficking in Suriname.",2

Sweden continues to maintain checkpoints on its external borders that were instituted during the 2015 refugee crisis.,4,The government respects the rights of individuals to own property and establish private businesses. A 2011 Supreme Court ruling granted Sami reindeer herders common-law rights to disputed lands.,4,"Same-sex couples are legally allowed to marry and adopt; lesbian couples have the same rights to artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization as heterosexual couples. An individual can legally change their gender identity, though doing so requires a medical assessment. There are persistently high levels of rape and sexual assault in the country, although the relatively high rates may be due to how rape is recorded and defined compared to other countries.",4,"People in Sweden generally enjoy equality of opportunity. However, unemployment is higher among immigrants, and particularly immigrant women, than it is among people who were born in Sweden. Increasing violence in the less affluent, ethnically diverse suburbs points to a frustration among those residents, many of whom are immigrants, that they do not enjoy the same equality of opportunity as ethnic Swedish citizens. According to the 2022 Labor Force Survey from Statistics Sweden, the employment rate for foreign-born residents was 64.2 percent compared with 70.5 percent for Swedish-born residents. The United Nations has also noted that the performance gap between foreign-born and native-born children in school remains high. Sweden is a destination and, to a lesser extent, a transit point for women and children trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The Swedish government has a proactive antitrafficking program, but the United Nations has pointed out that Sweden lacks robust methods to prevent individuals, especially unaccompanied immigrant children, from falling victim to human trafficking.",4

However, rising COVID-19 infections in early 2022 again forced some businesses to reduce their activity or even close temporarily.",4,"Personal social freedoms are protected for most people. In a 2005 referendum, voters approved same-sex civil unions. Recognized since 2007, these unions granted many of the legal benefits of marriage. Limited adoption rights for same-sex civil partners were granted in 2018. Members of parliament voted to approve same-sex marriage and allow transgender and intersex people to update identity documents more easily in 2020. Voters also supported same-sex marriage and adoption rights in a September 2021 referendum. The right to easily update identity documents, meanwhile, was included in the civil code and took effect in January 2022.",4,"The Swiss government does not fully comply with international antitrafficking standards, according to the US State Department’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report. Swiss authorities made some efforts to support international trafficking investigations during the department’s reporting period, but sentencing of convicted traffickers was considered “lenient.” In April 2021, Switzerland signed on to an ILO framework to combat forced labor, modern slavery, human trafficking, and child labor.Labor regulations are generally enforced, but migrant workers are more vulnerable to exploitation. No nationwide minimum wage exists and voters rejected an initiative to introduce one in 2014. The cantons of Geneva, Jura, Neuchâtel, Ticino, and the half-canton of Basel-Stadt do maintain minimum wages.",3

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported in December 2022 that there were 5.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Syria. More than 5.5 million Syrians have sought refuge abroad. Some Syrians have begun returning to their homes in areas where fighting has subsided, though new violence and displacements continued to occur in 2022.",0,"Property rights have been routinely disregarded throughout the civil war. Businesses are frequently required to bribe officials to operate and complete bureaucratic procedures. Access to markets dominated by regime members or allies is restricted. Militias extort businesses and confiscate private property to varying degrees.Law No. 10 of 2018 allows the state to designate areas for reconstruction and redevelopment by decree; individuals who cannot meet a number of criteria to prove ownership of affected property risk losing it without compensation. Personal status laws based on Sharia (Islamic law) discriminate against women on inheritance matters, and societal practices further discourage land ownership by women.",0,"Perpetrators of “honor crimes” can receive reduced sentences under the penal code, and rapists can avoid punishment by marrying their victims. Women cannot pass citizenship on to their children. Personal status laws for Muslims put women at a disadvantage regarding marriage, divorce, and child custody. Church law governs personal status issues for Christians, in some cases barring divorce. Early and forced marriages are a problem, with displaced families in particular marrying off young daughters as a perceived safeguard against endemic sexual violence or due to economic pressure. Personal social freedoms for women are uneven in areas outside government control, ranging from onerous codes of dress and behavior in extremist-held areas to formal equality under the PYD in Kurdish-held areas. However, the 2019 defeat of IS, setbacks for other extremist groups, and a decline in the scale of fighting over time has reduced the population’s exposure to the most egregious violations of personal social freedoms.",1,"Many armed groups forcibly conscript or use child soldiers. Children are also subject to forced labor in the context of severe economic hardship. IDPs and refugees are especially vulnerable to sexual and labor exploitation and human trafficking, even in relatively stable government-controlled areas, as access to employment and investment is often dependent on personal, political, or communal affiliations.",0
taiwan,"Taiwan’s residents enjoy freedom of movement, and the government has gradually eased restrictions on travel between Taiwan and China in recent years. However, despite laws and guidelines meant to protect them, some migrant workers routinely experience illegitimate movement restrictions, such as the withholding of travel documents by employers. Contractual restrictions make it difficult in practice for many migrant workers to change employers. Coronavirus-related restrictions were relaxed in 2022 as the government ended its zero-COVID strategy. In October, for example, travelers were no longer required to enter quarantine. Migrant workers continued to face some restrictions in 2022, however. Coronavirus-related rules have been applied against migrant workers in a discriminatory manner during the pandemic.",4,"Although property rights are generally respected, urban renewal and industrial projects have been criticized for unfairly displacing residents. Housing advocates have called for legal amendments to clarify residency rights, including protections against forced eviction, and the establishment of an appeals system to review alleged violations.Indigenous groups argue that government efforts to recognize their claims to ancestral lands are inadequate, as the project applies only to state-owned land and excludes large segments of privately owned territory.",3,"There are no major restrictions on personal status matters such as marriage and divorce, although Chinese nationals who are married to Taiwanese nationals must wait six years before becoming eligible for citizenship; spouses of other nationalities need only wait four years. Same-sex marriages have been legal in Taiwan since 2019.Rape and domestic violence remain serious problems. While the law permits authorities to investigate complaints without victims pressing charges, cultural norms inhibit many women from reporting these crimes to the police. Reforms have improved protections for accusers and encouraged reporting of rape and sexual assault, which appears to have increased prosecution and conviction rates.",4,"Protections against exploitative working conditions in Taiwan are relatively strong overall, and NGOs actively expose abuses and advocate for policy improvements. Amendments to the Labor Standards Act (LSA) instituted in 2018 allowed employers to schedule more consecutive workdays and shorter breaks between shifts than previously, in what was considered a setback for workers.Many of Taiwan’s 700,000 migrant workers are mistreated or exploited by employers, despite 2018 amendments to the Employment Services Act that were meant to address abuses. These workers are often indebted to brokers. The LSA does not cover foreign domestic workers or fishery workers; they are subjected to the withholding of wages, long working hours, physical and sexual abuse, lack of food or medical care, denial of sleep, substandard safety equipment, poor living conditions, and extortion or fraud by recruitment and brokerage agencies. Abuses are particularly prevalent aboard distant fishing vessels, with crewmembers being physically assaulted, working excessive hours, and having their wages withheld.Some skilled foreign workers and students are encouraged to seek permanent residency under a Labor Ministry initiative.For-profit universities have reportedly recruited foreign students—especially from Indonesia—and then placed them into exploitative labor conditions under the pretense of educational opportunity.",3

tanzania,"Residents enjoy some basic freedoms pertaining to travel and changes of residence, employment, and education. The government has wide discretion in enforcing laws that can limit movement, particularly in Zanzibar, where the approval of local government appointees is often required for changes in employment, personal banking, and residency. Separately, the authorities in recent years have arbitrarily arrested and deported some Kenyans, many of whom had been granted Tanzanian citizenship. The government imposes travel restrictions on activists, human rights researchers, opposition figures, and other prominent individuals. Opposition politicians who were under threat of violence struggled to leave Tanzania after the 2020 election.",2,"Tanzanians have the right to establish private businesses but are often required to pay bribes to license and operate them. The state owns all land and leases it to individuals and private entities, leading to clashes over land rights between citizens and companies engaged in extractive industries.

The law’s implementation has been limited by shortcomings including a lack of awareness of its provisions, a shortage of trained agents to handle complaints, pressure on women from some agents to avoid taking abusive husbands to court, and logistical barriers to reporting abuse. High-profile cases of femicide stemming from domestic violence continued to be reported during 2022.Public displays of affection can lead to charges of violating public morality laws, which carry penalties including jail time.",3,"Despite efforts by civil society groups to combat such problems, Tunisian women and children are subject to sex trafficking and forced domestic work both in Tunisia and abroad. Refugees and other migrants are also susceptible to exploitation by traffickers. Cases of exploitation in the agriculture and textile sectors are prevalent; women often work long hours with no contracts, benefits, or legal recourse, and many are reportedly transported to work sites under dangerous conditions.Protests continue to call attention to the lack of economic opportunity associated with high inflation, unemployment, and a dearth of meaningful reform to address such issues. The COVID-19 pandemic, by many measures, exacerbated Tunisia’s social and economic challenges. In 2022, rising food prices and shortages of basic staples were driven by a combination of internal causes and the international effects of the war in Ukraine.",2
turkey,"Freedom of movement is limited in some regions and for groups treated with suspicion by the government. In southeastern Turkey, movement is limited due to the conflict between the government and the PKK. More than 125,000 public sector workers who were fired or suspended following the coup attempt in 2016 have since been unable to find employment due to an atmosphere of guilt by association and cannot travel abroad as their passports have been canceled. Refugees continue to face legal and practical obstacles to free employment and movement within the country.",1,"Private property rights are legally enshrined, but for the last decade, critics or opponents of the government have been subjected to intrusive tax and regulatory inspections. Since 2016, the assets of hundreds of companies, NGOs, and media outlets deemed to be associated with terrorist groups have been confiscated. From 2016–18, at least $11 billion in private business assets, ranging from corner stores to large conglomerates, were seized. The developments have severely harmed public confidence in the rule of law and free enterprise.",1,"Turkey’s GBV and femicide rates are among the world’s highest, and women’s rights activists largely blame this environment on a culture of impunity enabled by the government and judiciary. Turkey’s withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention, an international treaty to prevent GBV, in 2021 removed key legal protections for women facing domestic abuse. Police are reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes and few women’s shelters exist. Erdoğan and the AKP consistently campaign to dissuade women from seeking divorce and to bear at least three children. Contraception, while legal, is increasingly difficult to access. Child marriages, although illegal, often take place, mainly performed through unofficial religious ceremonies or by fraudulently obtaining marriage licenses using false identification.",2,"The weakness of labor unions and the government’s increasing willingness to act against organized labor have undermined equality of opportunity, protection from economic exploitation, and workplace safety. Workplace accidents have become frequent in recent years and laborers have little recourse if injured. According to the Health and Safety Labor Watch (İSİG), at least 1,843 workers died in work-related incidents in 2022. Only a tiny portion of refugees have work permits. Turkey’s informal economy is as big as about a third of its overall economy, and migrant and refugee workers are especially vulnerable to economic exploitation in unregulated industry.",1
turkmenistan,"Freedom of movement is restricted, with frequent reports of individuals being barred from traveling abroad; officials are reportedly instructed to prevent citizens under the age of 40 from leaving the country. The government is known to prohibit the families of dissidents and prisoners from leaving. Internal passports and a residency permit system also obstruct travel within the country.Additional restrictions on the freedom of movement were imposed in January and July 2022 ostensibly in response to outbreaks of COVID-19, though the government denies the presence of the coronavirus in the country.",0,"The constitution establishes the right to property ownership, but the deeply flawed judiciary provides little protection to businesses and individuals, and the president’s relatives monopolize key sectors of the economy that are not directly state controlled. Arbitrary evictions and confiscation of property are common.",1,"Domestic violence is reportedly common, but few victims file complaints with the authorities, and the government has not made significant efforts to monitor, prevent, or combat the problem. Reporting and prosecution of rape are similarly limited. While polygamy has long been illegal, it apparently persists in practice.Restrictions that entered into force in April 2022 significantly curtailed people’s social freedoms, particularly women’s. The new rules banned women from wearing tight clothes, dyeing their hair, and wearing certain accessories. Cosmetic surgery has been outlawed, male drivers of private cars are no longer allowed to have nonfamily female passengers, and women may not ride in the front seat of a car. There have been reports of couples being detained for holding hands in the city of Mary. There were also reports of women losing their jobs for having undertaken cosmetic surgery and being refused aboard a flight because of their appearance and their use of cosmetics.",1,"The government forces thousands of students, public employees, and other citizens to participate in the annual cotton harvest with little or no pay. Impoverished residents of rural areas are especially vulnerable to trafficking abroad for forced labor or sexual exploitation, and the government does little to address the problem.The state’s mismanagement of a weak economy, including soaring inflation, has inhibited opportunity and imposed hardships on the population. Persistently low oil and gas prices have driven down vital export revenues in recent years, leading to reports of unpaid wages and shortages of basic goods. Basic food stuffs are reportedly being rationed and people caught buying more than their allotted shared of bread have been threatened by the police with a penalty of 15 days in prison.",0

The country’s borders were closed to international travel in 2020 due to COVID-19; home isolation rules were rescinded in November 2022 and the border was reopened in December.,4,"Tuvalu’s legal framework and government policies are generally supportive of property rights and private business activity. However, laws and practices surrounding land ownership and inheritance favor men over women.",3,"Although personal social freedoms are generally respected, domestic violence often goes unreported because it is viewed as a private matter. There are no specific laws against spousal rape.",3,"Forced labor is prohibited, and the government mandates basic protections against exploitative or dangerous working conditions, though enforcement is not proactive or consistent. Most of the labor force works in the informal sector or in small-scale fishing and agriculture. No law addresses forms of harmful or hazardous child labor. The 2021 edition of the US State Department’s Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor noted evidence of child labor in the fishing industry and among domestic workers. The State Department also reported that Tuvalu made “minimal advancement” to address child labor.Under legislation passed in 2017, the ombudsman’s office functions as the country’s national human rights institution. The office was charged with reviewing Tuvaluan legislation against Funafuti’s international obligations under a 2016–20 action plan.",3
uganda,"Freedom of movement is largely unrestricted, though this was not the case during the COVID-19 pandemic when the government violently enforced harsh restrictions. The last curfew restrictions were lifted in February 2022. However, economic barriers to movement often limit Ugandans’ mobility in practice.",3,"Land disputes are common, especially in the post-conflict north, and throughout the country where private investors seek to develop land or extract resources, resulting in forced evictions which are sometimes but not always compensated. While women have a legal right to own and inherit land, they are often excluded from doing so.In 2020, the government received a commission of inquiry (COI) report on land rights, which recommended the establishment of land courts and an ombudsman, among other measures. In March 2022, President Museveni banned all land evictions not approved by the District Security Committee, chaired by the presidentially appointed Resident District Commissioner.Despite Museveni’s actions, evictions due to environmental concerns including flooding and landslides are increasingly common. Throughout 2022, opposition politicians criticized the government for selectively evicting people from environmentally sensitive areas, whether to protect the land or the people.",2,"Aside from restrictions on same-sex relations including marriage, personal social freedoms are largely regulated at a societal and familial level. The median age of marriage for women is 18.7 years, compared to 23.3 years for men, according to a 2016 national survey. In the same survey, 25 percent of women reported that their husband or partner had multiple wives. Domestic violence is widespread; more than 60 percent of young adults experienced physical abuse as children, according to a 2019 UN Children’s Fund report, while in the 2016 national survey, 46 percent of ever-married women and 23 percent of ever-married men report that they are afraid of their current or most recent partner some or most of the time. As noted in other sections, there is very low tolerance for LGBT+ people, who face serious persecution and physical danger.A Nordic Africa Institute report published in May 2021 noted that Ugandan girls were at higher risk of gender-based violence (GBV) due to COVID-19-related school closures and stringent lockdown measures. Nearly 645,000 teenage pregnancies were reported between March 2020 and September 2021, according to the UN Population Fund.",1,"Poor enforcement of labor laws contributes to unsafe or exploitative conditions for some workers, including extremely low pay. Child labor in agriculture, domestic service, and a variety of other industries is a significant problem, and the issue is most prevalent in rural areas. Sexual exploitation of minors is also an ongoing problem.While Uganda maintains domestic laws to promote workers’ rights, the government has failed to regulate the recruitment and transfer of Ugandan domestic workers to Middle Eastern countries. An estimated 165,000 Ugandans have migrated to Saudi Arabia since 2017. Accounts describe workers experiencing sexual abuse, beatings, exploitation, and torture. In July 2022, the Committee on Gender, Labour, and Social Development urged the government to put in place a system to monitor and protect Ugandans employed as domestic workers abroad; in September, the government announced its plan to repatriate 500 Ugandan migrant workers from the Arabian Peninsula.",1
ukraine,"As a result of the full-scale Russian invasion that began in February 2022, about one third of Ukrainians were forced from their homes during the year. Some five million sought refuge abroad; roughly 13 million people are estimated to remain in war-affected areas with damaged transportation and other infrastructure and heightened security risks, including an estimated six million IDPs. In addition to the disruption to employment and education caused by the Russian invasion, the danger of land mines and unexploded ordnance prevents refugees and displaced individuals from returning home and impairs agricultural activity.Russian and Russian-affiliated authorities have forcibly transferred Ukrainian civilians, including children, to either Russia or Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, in violation of international law. They have also subjected thousands of Ukrainians to humiliating and abusive security screening known as “filtration,” placing those who “fail” ideological screening into detention camps.In early March 2022, the Ukrainian government implemented a decree on general mobilization. The new rules prohibited most men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country. The rules were tightened in September to apply to Ukrainian men who had been admitted to study at foreign institutions, with authorities citing the mass forgery of documents. Apart from the mobilization rules, freedom of movement is generally not restricted in areas under government control. However, Ukraine’s cumbersome system requiring individuals to be legally registered at an address in order to receive important services has long created a barrier to full freedom of movement and employment. ",1,"The government has taken steps to scale back regulation of private businesses in recent years, though the business environment is affected by widespread corruption. A reform law allowing the sale of agricultural land went into effect in July 2021, ending a moratorium. Under the law, only individual Ukrainian citizens can currently buy and sell farmland; organizations will be able to acquire such land beginning in 2024, so long as their participating members are all Ukrainian citizens.",2,"The government generally does not restrict personal social freedoms, though same-sex marriage remains unrecognized in Ukraine. Ongoing Russian military aggression has added urgency to calls for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Ukraine, which would afford same-sex partners of wounded and deceased soldiers the same rights and benefits as those granted to heterosexual couples. Since the Ukrainian constitution, which defines marriage as “based on the free consent of a woman and a man,” cannot be changed during wartime, Zelenskyy in 2022 ordered the prime minister to work out legal recognition of civil partnerships that would apply most of the rights of marriage to same-sex partners.	Domestic violence is widespread, and police responses to the few victims who report such abuse are inadequate. In July 2022, however, the parliament ratified the Istanbul Convention, the Council of Europe’s treaty on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.",3,"The trafficking of women domestically and abroad for the purpose of prostitution continues. IDPs are especially vulnerable to exploitation for sex trafficking and forced labor.

The new labor code adopted in July 2022 threatened to increase exploitative conditions for Ukrainians working at companies with fewer than 250 employees, as it withdrew legal protections and made their pay structure, working hours, and conditions or terms of contract termination subject to the employer’s discretion.",2
united-arab-emirates,"Emirati citizens face few apparent restrictions on movement within the UAE or on their ability to change their place of employment, though societal norms sometimes constrain a woman’s ability to work or travel without the consent of her husband, father, or other male guardian.Under the kafala system, migrant workers’ legal status is tied to their employers’ sponsorship, meaning they can be punished or deported for leaving employment without meeting certain criteria. Stateless residents’ freedom of movement is limited by their lack of travel documents; under a government program, many stateless people have received passports from the Comoros that ease travel and other activities but do not confer full citizenship.",1,"The UAE has enacted reforms in recent years to ease procedures for establishing and operating businesses. However, the government and ruling families exercise considerable influence over the economy and are involved in many of the country’s major economic and commercial initiatives, limiting the space for independent business activity.Citizens of the UAE and other GCC states are able to own property. In 2019, the emirate of Abu Dhabi allowed foreigners to own freehold property in designated investment zones. Dubai has permitted non-GCC nationals to own property in designated zones since 2001. Women generally receive smaller inheritances than men under Sharia, and women are excluded from state benefits aimed at supporting home ownership. A law implemented in the emirate of Abu Dhabi in 2021 allowed non-Muslim residents to benefit from new inheritance rules.",1,"Women are generally placed at a distinct disadvantage under laws governing marriage and divorce. Among other disparities, a Muslim woman’s male guardian must approve her marriage. Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslims, while Muslim men may marry Christian or Jewish women. Some categories of extramarital sex are criminal offenses, which deters victims from reporting rape. No laws prohibit spousal rape. A measure adopted in 2019 introduced orders of protection and new criminal penalties to address domestic violence, but its wording appeared to allow some forms of control or punishment by male guardians.In 2020, the government announced changes to Sharia-based laws that decriminalized consensual sex and cohabitation by unmarried heterosexual couples; eliminated penalties for the possession, purchase, or consumption of alcohol by people aged 21 or older; and repealed legal provisions that assigned lighter penalties for “honor crimes” against women. The amendments would also allow couples who married in another country to adhere to that country’s divorce and inheritance laws. The updated penal code that took effect in January 2022 reintroduced criminal penalties for unmarried couples in some situations, for example by allowing the husband or male guardian of a woman in such a relationship to file charges.In 2021, the emirate of Abu Dhabi announced a new law on divorce, inheritance, and child custody concerns for non-Muslims; among other things, the law allowed for joint-custody arrangements and civil marriage. The emirate also announced a new court to adjudicate matters under the new law.",1,"Economic disparities persist between UAE citizens living in more and less affluent emirates and between citizens and the noncitizen majority. Foreign workers are often exploited and subjected to harsh working conditions, physical abuse, and withholding of passports, with little to no access to legal recourse. A series of ministerial decrees issued in 2015 aimed to give migrant workers more flexibility to terminate employment under certain conditions. Foreign household workers were not covered by those decrees or by labor laws in general, leaving them especially vulnerable. A law adopted in 2017 guaranteed such household workers basic protections and benefits including sick leave and daily rest periods, though they were inferior to those in the national labor law, and household workers would still be unable to leave their employers without a breach of contract.",1
united-states,"There are no significant undue restrictions on freedom of movement within the United States, and residents are generally free to travel abroad without improper obstacles. A patchwork of temporary movement restrictions prompted by the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 were loosely enforced and had mostly been lifted by late 2021 as vaccination rates rose.",4,"Property rights are widely respected in the United States. The legal and political environments are supportive of entrepreneurial activity and business ownership. Pandemic-related business restrictions at the state and local levels, which caused significant disruption and prompted civil disobedience and public protests by some private business owners in 2020, declined as vaccination rates rose and businesses reopened in 2021.",4,"Men and women generally enjoy equal rights in divorce and custody proceedings, and there are no undue restrictions on choice of marriage partner, particularly after a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that all states must allow same-sex marriage. In December 2022, Congress passed and the president signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which would require the federal government and all states to recognize same-sex marriages performed legally in other states, even if the Supreme Court were to reverse its 2015 decision. In recent years, a growing number of states have passed laws to eliminate exemptions that allowed marriages of people under age 18 in certain circumstances. Rape and domestic or intimate-partner violence remain serious problems. The applicable laws vary somewhat by state, though spousal rape is a crime nationwide. Numerous government and nongovernmental programs are designed to combat such violence and assist victims.In June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned a 1973 precedent and found that the federal constitution did not guarantee a right to abortion, thereby returning the issue to the states. By year’s end, near-total bans on abortion had taken effect in at least 12 states, with only narrow exceptions that would make access extremely difficult or dangerous in practice. Increased restrictions were in effect in an additional five states, and court injunctions temporarily blocked near-total or significant bans in six other states. The populations of states where abortion was effectively unavailable or severely restricted accounted for nearly a third of US women of reproductive age. Critics of the new or revived state restrictions noted that their vague language introduced considerable uncertainty about whether doctors would face prosecution even for providing potentially life-saving care. Scores of clinics—nearly 70 as of October—were forced to stop offering abortion services or close entirely, compelling women in the affected states to travel to jurisdictions with more liberal laws in order to seek treatment, a constraint that disproportionately burdened women with lower incomes. Although reproductive rights advocates mobilized to help pay for travel and facilitate access to abortion medication, access to abortion demonstrably declined, particularly in the 12 states with near-total bans in effect; even in states where abortion remained legal, providers sometimes lacked the capacity to serve both local patients and those traveling from other states. Voters in six states were presented with referendums on abortion rights in August and November, and in each case majorities supported the option that would preserve wider access to abortion.The recent pattern of state laws restricting the rights of transgender people has also affected their access to medical treatments related to bodily autonomy and appearance. ",3,"The “American dream”—the notion of a fair society in which hard work will bring economic and social advancement, regardless of the circumstances of one’s birth—is a core part of the country’s identity. In recent decades, however, studies have shown a widening inequality in wealth and a narrowing of access to upward mobility. A series of economic stimulus and relief packages introduced by the federal government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic successfully reduced overall poverty rates, but the temporary nature of some highly effective programs, such as an expanded tax credit for families with children that expired at the end of 2021, meant that the societal gains were often ephemeral.One key aspect of inequality in the United States is the growing income and wealth gap between Americans with university degrees and those with a high school degree or less; the number of well-compensated jobs for the less-educated has fallen over time as manufacturing and other positions are lost to automation and lower-cost foreign production. These jobs have generally been replaced by less remunerative or less stable employment in the service and retail sectors, where there is a weaker tradition of unionization. The pandemic-related economic shock amplified that dynamic, disrupting employment and income for lower-earning, less-educated workers in particular. In 2021, a lockdown-induced spike in household savings, combined with fiscal and monetary stimulus policies, produced strong demand, greater bargaining power, and higher wages for such workers. However, the same factors, along with persistent trade disruptions caused by the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, also produced high levels of inflation that tempered the effect of wage increases through 2022.The inflation-adjusted national minimum wage has fallen substantially since the 1960s, with the last nominal increase in 2009, though many states and localities have enacted increases since then. Other obstacles to gainful employment include inadequate public transportation and the high cost of living in economically dynamic cities and regions. The latter problem, which is exacerbated by exclusionary housing policies in many jurisdictions, has also contributed to an overall rise in homelessness in recent years.",3

In 2017, the president issued a decree to formally ban forced agricultural labor by students, health workers, and teachers. During the subsequent cotton harvests, the government increased incentives for voluntary labor and granted access to international observers. In 2018, the International Labor Organization (ILO) noted that 93 percent of cotton workers were voluntarily employed for that year’s harvest, while child labor was not an issue.
