afghanistan,"Afghanistan is an effective one-party state under the Taliban. Political parties have no legal protection. However, some parties informally operate in Afghanistan; their leaders operate in exile abroad.",0,The government of the IEA is exclusively composed of Taliban members. No other party has a share in or can compete for power. The Taliban tolerate no opposition.,0,"Citizens cannot exercise any meaningful political choice under the Taliban. Policymaking, resource allocation, and the selection of officials all take place opaquely within the structures of the IEA. At most, some Taliban officials in provincial administrations are reportedly open to limited consultation and lobbying by male community representatives.",0,"No group in Afghanistan enjoys political rights or electoral opportunities. Some groups are particularly marginalized and excluded from the limited public debate that does occur. Under the Taliban, women are excluded from any position of official authority and are additionally impacted by restrictions on their movement. A June–July 2022 assembly that included clerics and traditional leaders included no women. Most Taliban members belong to the Pashtun ethnic group, which is believed to represent 42 percent of the Afghan population. Members of that group hold top positions in powerful ministries, though non-Pashtun members of the Taliban hold less powerful posts. LGBT+ people are thoroughly excluded from political participation; the Taliban support the former republic’s criminalization of same-sex relations and reject LGBT+ rights.",0
albania,"Albanian citizens generally have the right to organize in political parties. The two main parties, PS and PD, are sharply polarized and given to personality-driven rivalry. Candidates who do not belong to a party currently seated in the Assembly must collect a set number of signatures to run.In January 2022, PD leader Lulzim Basha expelled former premier Sali Berisha from the party. The decision came after months of internal tension and days after Berisha supporters attempted to storm the party’s headquarters. An intraparty conflict between the two men’s supporters ensued; in March, Basha resigned as party leader, with Berisha succeeding him in May.",3,"In Albania’s multiparty system, opposition parties have the opportunity to participate in the political process and take power via the ballot box.",3,"While individuals are generally free to make their own political choices, powerful economic actors shape Albanian politics through their media holdings and influence on electoral campaigns. Criminal organizations and corrupt actors are also known to exert influence.",3,"Albanian law guarantees political rights for citizens regardless of their ethnic, racial, lingual, or religious identity. However, Roma and other marginalized communities remain vulnerable to political exploitation and have difficulty participating in politics.Women are underrepresented in the Assembly, holding 35.7 percent of its seats. However, a record 12 women were appointed to the 17-member cabinet in September 2021.",3
algeria,"The Interior Ministry must approve political parties before they can operate legally. Parties cannot form along explicitly ethnic lines. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which swept the 1990 local and 1991 national elections that preceded Algeria’s decade-long civil war, remains banned. Since the Hirak emerged in 2019, the authorities have intensified their repression of opposition groups, especially parties espousing separatism, Islamist groups, and parties perceived as closely aligned with the Hirak.In January 2022, the Council of State suspended the opposition Socialist Workers’ Party (PST) for allegedly failing to organize its annual congress within the legally mandated timeframe.In recent years, authorities have increasingly used vaguely worded antiterrorism legislation to prosecute members of the opposition. In 2021, the High Security Council designated the Rachad—an organization that includes former FIS members—and the Movement for the Self-Determination of Kabylie (MAK) as terrorist organizations. Numerous people accused of affiliation with the groups have since faced arrest. In November 2022, exiled MAK leader Ferhat Mehenni was sentenced in absentia to life in prison on terrorism-related charges.",1,"Opposition parties play a marginal role in Parliament, and their campaigns are regularly curtailed by the government. Election boycotts by opposition groups are not uncommon.Opposition leaders have also been subject to detention and prosecution. In January 2022, an Algiers court sentenced Democratic and Social Movement (MDS) leader Fethi Ghares to two years’ imprisonment and a 200,000 dinar ($1,400) fine on charges including “offending public bodies.”",1,"The military retains its long-standing influence over civilian politics. Its vast resources and lack of public accountability have helped shape its role as the most powerful political actor in Algeria.Allegations and scandals involving corruption in the selection of political candidates, as well as vote-buying during elections, have surfaced in recent years. After Bouteflika stepped down in 2019, the authorities initiated an anticorruption campaign targeting entrepreneurs and officials who were accused of exercising improper influence on political decisions under the former administration.",1,"No specific ethnic or religious group dominates the main state institutions, which tend to include both Arab and Amazigh (Berber) officials. Kabylie-based parties associated with the Amazigh community, like the Rally for Culture and Democracy and the FFS, have controlled a small number of municipalities, but their activities are often curtailed by the military. Some Amazigh activists have been targeted by the authorities for mobilizing in support of their political interests.Women remain reluctant to run for office, are often unable to secure meaningful influence within Parliament, and are more likely to lose intraparty debates. Women won only 8 percent of the seats in the 2021 lower house elections.LGBT+ people are politically marginalized and have little practical ability to advocate for their political interests.",1
andorra,"Political parties may form and operate freely, and there are a number of active parties in Andorra. Two new parties, TV and CC, made their debut in the 2019 elections.",4,"The country has experienced multiple democratic transfers of power between rival parties, most recently in 2011, when the DA replaced a government led by the PS. Opposition parties are well represented in the Consell General and deprived the DA of its outright majority in the 2019 elections.",4,Citizens and political figures are generally able to make political choices without undue interference from external forces.,4,"More than 50 percent of the population consists of noncitizens—mostly from nearby states—who do not have the right to vote in national elections or run for elected office. Under Andorra’s restrictive naturalization criteria, one must marry a resident Andorran or live in the country for more than 20 years to qualify for citizenship. Prospective citizens are also required to learn Catalan, the national language.Women are active in politics, and after the 2019 elections they held 50 percent of the seats in the legislature. LGBT+ people are also free to participate in politics, and several parties advocate for their interests.",3
angola,"While there is a multiparty system in place, competition is limited. The process for creating new political parties is fraught with bureaucratic obstacles and attempts at co-optation, factors that severely hinder public confidence in new parties.Citing irregularities in the process, the Constitutional Court in 2020 rejected the legalization of a new opposition party, PRA-JA Servir Angola, led by Abel Chivukuvuku. The decision also placed limits on the ability of Chivukuvuku and the party’s other promoters to attempt to establish a new, different party ahead of the 2022 elections.Separately, the Constitutional Court ruled in October 2021 that the election of Adalberto da Costa Jr. as UNITA party leader in 2019 had been illegal. Delegates at a UNITA party congress in December 2021 then reelected Costa as their leader; he ran unopposed and took more than 96 percent of the votes.",1,"The MPLA has governed without interruption since Angola secured independence in 1975, and the country has never experienced a transfer of power between rival parties. However, opposition parties have been building public support in recent years, and the UNITA-led coalition increased its representation by 39 seats in the 2022 elections; the MPLA lost 26 seats. The authorities have repeatedly postponed plans to hold the country’s first-ever municipal elections, and no such balloting was held during 2022. Some analysts have argued that the administration is reluctant to relinquish its power to appoint subnational officials, as it would risk giving the opposition an opportunity to win office and demonstrate an ability to govern.",1,MPLA-aligned economic oligarchies nurture a system of dependency and patronage that can subvert candidates’ and voters’ ability to freely express their political choices.,1,"While societal pressures can discourage women from active political participation, women’s rights advocates have an increasingly vocal presence in political life. Women held 74 seats in the National Assembly after the 2022 elections, and members elected the body’s first woman speaker in September.Government and state institutions are controlled by the MPLA, which draws much of its support from the Kimbundu ethnic group. The Ovimbundo and Kikongo ethnicities are predominant, respectively, in UNITA and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA).Issues affecting LGBT+ people have historically been excluded from political debate. This changed somewhat with the parliament’s 2019 adoption of a new penal code that decriminalized same-sex relations.",2
antigua-and-barbuda,"Political parties can organize and operate freely. While there are several small political parties in the country, elections have been won by either the ABLP or the UPP since 1994. The first-past-the-post electoral system makes it very difficult for smaller, less well-established parties to gain representation in the House of Representatives.",3,There are realistic opportunities for opposition parties to increase their support or gain power through elections. Power has alternated frequently between the ABLP and UPP.,4,"People’s political choices are generally free from the influence of nondemocratic actors. However, a lack of transparency for party and campaign financing has given rise to concerns about the potential influence of unknown domestic and foreign interests over political candidates. The most significant case was that of R. Allen Stanford, a US citizen who was an influential figure in Antigua, and established a bank in the country from which he ran a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.",3,"Women are underrepresented in politics, and only two women were elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. LGBT+ people are marginalized and face discrimination, impacting their ability to engage fully in political processes.",3
argentina,"Argentina has competitive political parties that operate without undue obstacles. Primary elections are mandatory for presidential and legislative elections, and only party candidates that obtain 1.5 percent of the national vote in primary elections can contest general elections.",4,"Argentina’s multiparty system affords opposition candidates the realistic opportunity to compete for political power. Opposition parties command significant popular support, have a large presence in Congress, and govern several provinces.The 2019 presidential election marked a return of Peronism; former president Macri was the only non-Peronist to complete a presidential term since 1928.",4,"Argentinians’ political choices are generally free from domination by democratically unaccountable groups. However, political choices are influenced by voter intimidation and clientelism, particularly in poorer regions. A failed assassination attempt against Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in September 2022 drew widespread condemnation across the political spectrum. Some of the vice president’s supporters, however, blamed the opposition for the attack, claiming that opposition politicians have encouraged political violence. Several people, including the gunman, were arrested in connection with the attempt on the vice president’s life; investigations into alleged links between right-wing extremist groups and the attack on Fernández de Kirchner were ongoing at year’s end. At least three people accused of participating in the attack remained in pretrial detention at the end of the year.",4,"All segments of the population have full political rights. However, in practice, poorer Argentinians, ethnic minorities, and Indigenous people have limited access to political power.The government has taken steps to improve women’s presence in politics. All legislative party lists must respect full gender parity by law. After the November 2021 elections, women held 44.8 percent of lower-house seats and 43.1 of upper-house seats. A Ministry of Women, Genders, and Diversity (MMGD), which promotes equality and combats gender-based violence, was formed in 2019. However, men still dominate judicial and political positions at the national and provincial levels. Only 2 of Argentina’s 24 provinces have women governors, and the Supreme Court has no female members. LGBT+ people are well-represented in Argentina and legal protections for LGBT+ people are robust. In 2021, Congress passed a law mandating that 1 percent of public sector jobs be reserved for transgender people.",4
armenia,"Political parties and opposition groups have been able to operate in a much freer environment since 2018. In January 2021, amendments to the Law on Parties took effect, tying public funding of political parties to female and nationwide representation and capping individual donations. An unprecedented number of political entities—22 political parties and 4 alliances—took part in June 2021 snap parliamentary elections.",3,"Before 2018, elections were highly flawed; the Republican Party of Armenia (HHK) had been the main ruling party since 1997, and opposition groups had little chance of winning power. However, the 2018 polls transformed the political landscape, and elections have become significantly more competitive. International and local observers deemed the June 2021 snap elections, which saw two opposition alliances gain parliamentary seats, to be competitive. Following local elections in December 2021, authorities within the Ministry of Justice began prosecuting several opposition-affiliated elected representatives of local government bodies, including various cities’ Councils of Elders. Local human rights advocates claimed the cases against the elected officials were politically motivated and called on the government to enable them to carry out their duties. In September 2022 local elections, the opposition parties won control of 9 out of 18 communities.In July 2022, the vice speaker of Parliament and the chairman of a standing committee—both from the opposition—were forced out of their positions due to absences. In protest, other opposition members resigned from their leadership posts in standing committees. The open posts remained vacant at the end of the year.",3,"In April 2021, the parliament adopted amendments calling for heavier penalties for vote buying, election-related violence, and disrupting the electoral process. They also criminalized the obstruction of pre-election campaign activities.Though the 2021 elections saw a decline in such practices, international observers reported allegations of election disruption, including isolated incidents of vote buying and the misuse of administrative resources.",2,"A system introduced as part of 2015 constitutional reforms mandates the inclusion of up to four members of Parliament representing ethnic minorities; all four must be elected on a party list. In 2021, the Civil Contract Party won three minority seats representing ethnic Russians, Yazidis, and Kurds, while the Armenia Alliance won one seat representing ethnic Assyrians. No openly LGBT+ people have run in elections or been appointed to a public office in Armenia. Women remain underrepresented in politics and government, and most parties do little to address women’s interests aside from meeting the gender quota on candidate lists.",2
australia,"Australians may organize political parties without restrictions. Registration and recognition as a political party requires a party constitution and either one member in Parliament, or at least 500 members on the electoral roll.",4,"Power rotates between parties frequently, traditionally alternating between the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition. The Greens and smaller left-leaning parties tend to ally with Labor, while rural-oriented and conservative parties often ally with the Liberals.",4,"Political participation in Australia is largely free from undue domestic influence. The UK’s monarch remains the Australian head of state, but the monarchy’s power is strictly limited by the Australian constitution and legal precedent.On Election Day in 2022, the Morrison government placed pressure on public servants working for Australian Border Force (ABF), part of the country’s immigration apparatus, to hastily release information about the interception of a Sri Lankan asylum seeker boat; the pressure and subsequent release of a Liberal Party SMS message about the situation appeared to be an attempt to influence the election.Concerns about foreign interference in politics, particular from China, have persisted for several years. There have been allegations that Chinese actors, possibly including consular officials, have funded political candidates and parties. The government banned foreign donations to political parties, independent candidates, and other political campaign groups in 2018. Additionally, the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme, which came into force that year, requires people who engage in political activities, such as lobbying on behalf of a foreign government or other entity, to register publicly.",4,"Political rights and electoral opportunities are granted to all Australians. The interests of women are inadequately represented, but the results of the 2022 election offer cautious optimism that this situation is changing. Following the election, 58 seats, or 38 percent of total seats, in the lower house were held by women, an increase of 10 from the previous parliament, and women made up a majority of the Australian Senate, holding 57 percent of its seats. A notable feature of the 2022 elections was the role played by  female “teal Independent” candidates, who in several cases ousted male incumbents in seats long considered safe.The Labor Party employs an internal quota specifying that 45 percent of its candidates must be women, a quota that will rise to 50 percent by 2025). A majority—52 of 103—of the members of the Labor Party’s federal caucus are women. By contrast, the Liberal Party has long resisted calls to introduce a gender quota system, and Liberal leader Peter Dutton and National Party leader David Littleproud again ruled out introducing quotas in 2022.Women in parliament have reported being intimidated and harassed by their male colleagues. A November 2021 report by Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner,  Kate Jenkins, found that a third of federal political staffers experienced sexual harassment at work. That same year, a series of high-profile sexual assault allegations emerged, corroborating the commissioner’s report and highlighting the misogyny and physical endangerment women in Australian politics face. One of those cases was the alleged 2019 rape of Liberal Party staffer Brittany Higgins by a colleague in the office of the defense minister at the time, Linda Reynolds, in 2019. Higgins accused the Liberal Party of covering up the story and leaking her personal information to journalists in an attempt to undermine her credibility. Higgins’s alleged rapist, Bruce Lehrmann, was charged but, in October 2022, his trial before the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory was aborted due to juror misconduct. A retrial, scheduled for February 2023, was abandoned by the prosecution, citing the impact that retestifying was likely to have on Higgins’s mental health. Both Higgins and Lehrmann foreshadowed further legal proceedings in relation to the way the trial was handled and the surrounding media coverage.The May 2022 elections resulted in improvements in the gender and racial diversity of Australia’s Parliament, with successful candidates including Independent representative Dai Le, a journalist and former Vietnamese refugee, and Labor senator Fatima Payman, the daughter of an Afghan Hazara refugee, who became Australia’s first hijab-wearing Muslim parliamentarian. However, Parliament remains disproportionately White compared to the make-up of Australia‘s population. Openly LGBT+ representatives have served in Parliament since the 1990s.Indigenous Australians are generally underrepresented in Australian politics and some voting restrictions—including the requirement that voters hold a fixed address and a ban on voting by prisoners serving long sentences—disproportionately affect Indigenous populations. However, the 2022 elections brought the total number of sitting Indigenous legislators to 11, bringing the proportion of First Nations parliamentarians—4.8 percent—above the proportion of Indigenous Australians as part of the Australian population—3.3 percent. After forming its government in 2022, the Labor Party pledged to hold a referendum by mid-2024 about constitutionally enshrining an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, a body that would advise Parliament on policy matters affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Text of the proposed constitutional reform was released in July 2022.",3
austria,Austria has competitive political parties that form and operate without encountering undue obstacles. Recent years have seen the rise and fall of various competing parties and coalitions through democratic processes.,4,"Opposition parties have a realistic opportunity to gain representation. Until recently, Austria has often been governed by grand coalitions, a trend that has fostered some public disillusionment with the political process. An ÖVP–FPÖ government, which collapsed in 2019, was succeeded by an ÖVP–Green Party coalition in January 2020. Within months of forming, People Freedom Fundamental Rights (MFG)—a so-called antilockdown party focused on opposing COVID-19-related restrictions—was able to gain enough votes to enter the state parliament in Upper Austria in September 2021.",4,Austrians are generally free to make their own political choices without pressure from any groups that are not democratically accountable.,4,"The participation of Slovene, Hungarian, and Romany minorities in local government remains limited. There is little minority representation in the legislature. The number of people who have been naturalized has fallen since the establishment of a more restrictive national integration policy in 2009. To qualify for naturalization, individuals must have lived in Austria for 10 years—including 5 as a permanent resident—as well as provide proof of regular income and renounce their existing citizenship.Several parties include support for gender equality in their platforms. In the 2019 elections, 39 percent of the members elected to the parliament were women, a slight increase compared to 2017. The country’s first majority-female cabinet was appointed in January 2020.Non-Austrian EU citizens are entitled to vote in municipal elections as well as in European Parliament elections.",3
azerbaijan,"The political environment in Azerbaijan is neither pluralistic nor competitive. The ability of opposition parties to operate and engage with the public is limited by the dominance of the YAP. A number of laws restrict candidates’ efforts to organize and hold rallies, and the opposition has virtually no access to coverage on television, which remains the most popular news source. The regime has cracked down violently on any Islamic political movement that reaches national prominence.Political dialogue between the government and the opposition began in 2020, resulting in the creation of new political parties for the first time since 2011. Another two parties were registered in 2021 as part of the process, which has been presented by the government as a “new political configuration.” However, critics say that the new parties are not genuine opposition groups and that the dialogue has been dominated by the government.In September 2022, a draft law regulating political parties was introduced in the Milli Mejlis. If adopted, the legislation would impose numerous new restrictions on the activities of political parties in Azerbaijan. Among other things, the bill included provisions requiring that new political parties have 200 founding members, each of whom has lived in Azerbaijan without interruption for the previous 20 years. Critics say the draft law is intended to stifle dissent, and would affect the ability of existing opposition parties to operate as well as prevent new parties from forming. The bill passed its first reading in the parliament in November, and remained awaiting presidential approval at year’s end.",1,"The Aliyev family has held the presidency since 1993. The biased electoral framework and repressive media and political environment effectively make it impossible for opposition parties to gain power through elections. The traditional opposition parties boycotted the most recent parliamentary, presidential, and municipal elections rather than take part in an unfair process.Opposition politicians and party officials are subject to arbitrary arrest on dubious charges, physical violence, and intimidation. In 2021, Niyameddin Ahmedov, a member of the opposition Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan (AXFP), was sentenced to 13 years in prison for financing terrorism, a charge his lawyers called politically motivated.",0,"The authoritarian system in Azerbaijan excludes the public from any genuine and autonomous political participation. The regime relies on abuse of state resources, corrupt patronage networks, and control over the security forces and criminal justice system to maintain its political dominance.",1,"The political system does not allow women or minority groups to organize independently or advocate for their respective interests. There are no meaningful mechanisms to promote increased representation of women and ethnic or religious minorities. The government has worked to stifle public expressions of ethnic Talysh and Lezgin identity, among other targeted groups. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) who left Nagorno-Karabakh and settled in other parts of Azerbaijan after the 1994 cease-fire have been unable to participate in municipal elections where they subsequently settled and are instead directed to vote for their former districts.",0
bahamas,"Political parties organize freely and operate unhindered. However, as electoral financing is not regulated, there is no legal obligation to disclose funding sources and no limit on campaign spending.",4,Opposition parties operate without undue interference. Political power has alternated between the PLP and the FNM since the country achieved independence in 1973.,4,"Voters and candidates are generally able to exercise their political choices freely. However, a lack of campaign-finance regulations leaves open avenues for the outsized role of money in politics.",4,"Only citizens may vote, and protracted citizenship and naturalization proceedings make achieving citizenship difficult for children born in The Bahamas to foreign parents. This predominantly affects children of Haitian immigrants.Women are politically underrepresented. In its 2021 postelectoral report, the OAS noted that women do not often seek office, in part due to “gendered perceptions of politics” and social pressure. The OAS nevertheless noted an increase in women candidates. Seven women won House of Assembly seats. Four women were appointed to the Senate. Women additionally serve as speakers of both houses.Openly LGBT+ people are not overtly represented in politics.",4
bahrain,"Formal political parties are illegal. A 2005 law makes it illegal to form political associations based on class, profession, or religion, while a 2016 amendment prohibits serving religious clerics from engaging in political activity. The law permits “political societies,” with some of the functions of a political party, to operate after registering with the government, but the authorities have closed almost all opposition political societies since 2016 and jailed many of their leaders. The most popular, the Shiite Islamist society Al-Wefaq, was forcibly disbanded that year for allegedly encouraging violence. The second-largest opposition group, the secularist National Democratic Action Society (Wa’ad), was banned in 2017. In 2018, the monarch banned individual members of dissolved groups from competing in elections. Individual opposition leaders and activists routinely face harassment, and the regime has forced many into prison or exile. In 2019, the country’s top court upheld a sentence of life in prison against Al-Wefaq general secretary Ali Salman, who was jailed in 2018 for alleged espionage on behalf of Qatar. He had been in detention on various charges since 2014.",0,"The ruling family maintains a monopoly on political power through formal and informal positions, with the crown prince currently serving as prime minister. A major cabinet reshuffle in June 2022 left three additional members of the ruling family in the offices of deputy prime minister, minister of interior, and minister of finance and national economy, though this was a historically small share of cabinet seats for the family.The constitutional system’s structure excludes the possibility of a change in government through elections, and the parliament has been dominated by progovernment lawmakers since the dissolution of the main opposition societies and the imprisonment of many of their leaders.",0,The monarchy generally excludes the public from any meaningful or genuinely independent political participation. Since 2011 it has used the security forces to isolate the country’s Shiite population and suppress political dissent. The royal court allegedly uses its patronage networks to influence candidates and elections.,0,"Although Shiite Muslims make up a majority of the citizenry, they have tended to be underrepresented in the cabinet and parliament. The regime, which is controlled by a Sunni ruling family, has often viewed Shiites with suspicion and sought to prevent them from organizing to advance their political interests. Senior positions in politics and government are typically allocated to members of the ruling family and affiliated Sunni tribes. Certain wealthy Shiite families also enjoy a privileged position. After the June 2022 cabinet reshuffle, nine of the 25 ministers belonged to the Shiite majority, though none were associated with the political opposition.Women formally enjoy full political rights but are marginalized in practice. A record high of eight women were elected to the lower house of parliament in November 2022, and five women served in the cabinet as of that month.Noncitizens make up about half of the total population, and most have no political rights, but the minority of expatriates who own property in Bahrain can vote in municipal elections. Citizenship generally must be inherited from a Bahraini father, and foreign men married to Bahraini women do not have access to naturalization.LGBT+ identity is generally not recognized openly, including in political contexts.",0
bangladesh,"Bangladesh has a multiparty system in which power has historically alternated between AL- and BNP-led coalitions; third parties have traditionally had difficulty achieving traction. Both parties are led by family dynasties and have little internal democracy. A crackdown on the BNP ahead of the 2018 elections significantly disrupted its operations. Since 2018, the government has eased restrictions on opposition protests and rallies, though opposition activities are still met with some repression. In 2022, the BNP was able to organize large protests, though authorities and AL supporters disrupted some of those events.The Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), which supported a BNP-led government from 2001 to 2006, lost its registration in 2013 for violating constitutional provisions outlawing religiously based parties. JI candidates have since run as independents or part of the BNP. JI came under continued pressure in 2022; in August, the EC announced it would not allow JI to pursue election activities under a new name. In December, the BNP founded a new electoral alliance in a move that analysts perceived an effort to distance it from JI. JI leaders have been prosecuted by the International Crimes Tribunal, a domestic government body that investigates war crimes committed during Bangladesh’s independence war.",2,"The BNP has been weakened by regular harassment and arrests of key members that have significantly harmed its ability to challenge the AL in elections; the BNP has also boycotted national and local elections in recent years. The 2018 election campaign, in which the BNP did take part, was marred by a crackdown that saw thousands of people and several political candidates arrested and many physically assaulted. BNP leader Khaleda Zia was imprisoned in 2018 and remains under de facto house arrest over corruption convictions. In December 2022, seven BNP lawmakers resigned at an antigovernment rally.Nevertheless, political conditions have marginally improved recently. Independent candidates and defectors defeated AL candidates in the 2021–22 local election cycle and the BNP was permitted to hold major protests in 2022.",1,"The AL and BNP dominate politics and limit political choices for those who question internal party structures or hierarchy, or who would create alternative parties or political groupings. Animosity between Hasina and Zia, as well as between lower-level cadres, has contributed to continued political and electoral violence in which thousands of people have been killed or injured.",2,"In the National Parliament, 50 seats are allotted to women, who are elected by political parties based on their overall share of elected seats. Women lead both main political parties. Nevertheless, societal discrimination limits female participation in politics in practice. Men are likelier to be selected as candidates, while women are often relegated to serving in women’s wings of their parties; women also face social pressure to refrain from political activity. Religious, ethnic, and other marginalized groups remain underrepresented in politics and state agencies.LGBT+ people are also limited in their ability to participate in politics, though they have won office. The town of Trilochanpur elected a member of the hijra community—whose members identify as neither male nor female and are classified as a distinct gender identity in Bangladesh—mayor in late 2021.",2
barbados,"The BLP dominates politics and holds all seats in the lower house, though other political parties do exist. The DLP was until recently a major political force but, along with several smaller opposition parties, failed to win any seats in either the 2018 or 2022 elections. Barbados has been without a leader of the opposition since January 2022, as no opposition party won seats in that month’s polls.",4,"Power has historically rotated peacefully between the BLP and DLP. However, the BLP won major electoral victories in 2018 and January 2022.The DLP, meanwhile, won no seats in either election. Since 2018, neither the DLP nor any other opposition party has received the annual subvention generally paid to such groups. In November 2022, the DLP called on the Mottley administration to account for the subvention funds and warned that the lack of opposition funding was impacting Barbadian party politics; the party also questioned whether the ruling BLP had received subvention funds instead.",3,Voters and candidates are generally able to express their political choices without interference from actors that are not democratically accountable.,4,"Barbados’s population is fully enfranchised, with adult citizens, Commonwealth citizens, and foreigners with seven years’ residency able to vote. Laws protect the political rights of women, but societal marginalization can discourage women from running for office. While the BLP and DLP leaders who contested the January 2022 elections were female, women make up only 26.7 percent of the House of Assembly—though that figure is the highest seen in the country’s history.",4
belarus,"Involvement in political activism can result in a loss of employment, expulsion from educational institutions, smear campaigns in the media, fines, the confiscation of property, and imprisonment. Political parties face formidable challenges when seeking official registration. Political initiatives are actively persecuted and can lead to criminal charges for their leaders. Authorities harass and threaten political opponents, public figures, and political dissidents through state media.Prominent political opponents to Lukashenka’s regime face politically motivated criminal charges and lengthy prison sentences. In 2021, Viktar Babaryka was sentenced to 14 years in prison and Siarhei Tsikhanouski to 18 years. Numerous activists and opposition members received lengthy prison terms in 2022, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) journalist Andrey Kuznechyk. In August 2020, Maryia Kalesnikava, who campaigned with Tsikhanouskaya and Babaryka, announced the creation of a new political party called “Together.” That September, Kalesnikava was kidnapped and later incarcerated, effectively ending the initiative. That same month, Tsikhanouskaya and other activists formed the Coordination Council, a civil society group that sought a peaceful resolution to the postelection violence and a rerun of the presidential poll. Belarusian authorities arrested and prosecuted several of its leaders, claiming that they were attempting to seize power illegally and that they were a national security threat. Coordination Council founding members Maryia Kalesnikava and Maxim Znak were sentenced in September 2021 to 11 years and 10 years in prison, respectively, on dubious charges including conspiracy to seize power.

Meaningful participation in politics is generally not possible. The police and military used severe, sometimes fatal, violence and arrested and detained over 33,000 people to crack down on the August–November 2020 prodemocracy protests, ensuring that Lukashenka would remain in power.

However, women are underrepresented in leadership positions. Independent civil society’s initiatives on raising awareness of gender-based violence and discrimination have been unsuccessful. State-sponsored women’s advocacy groups and the government refrain from addressing these issues. Authorities restrict the use of the Belarusian language in official settings, and Belarusian-language ballots were not available during the 2022 national referendum.Throughout 2022, the government implemented various measures designed to target political opponents, civil society activists, and journalists in exile and exclude them from the domestic political process. For example, Belarusians living abroad were not permitted to vote in the February constitutional referendum. In December, the government adopted a legislative amendment allowing the authorities to revoke the citizenship of both native-born and naturalized Belarusians abroad if they are convicted of charges related to “extremism”; the law had not entered into force before year’s end.",1

However, the 2019 regional and federal elections showed decreasing support for establishment parties and increasing support for far-right, far-left, and green parties across the country. The increasing power of the Flemish right-wing N-VA and the far-right VB makes majority coalitions that exclude these nationalist parties increasingly difficult to assemble. The N-VA and VB became the two largest parties in Flanders after the 2019 elections, and they criticized the formation in 2020 of a federal government that lacked their participation.",4,The political choices of voters and candidates are generally free from undue interference.,4,"Members of racial, ethnic, religious, and other minority groups are free to participate in national and subnational politics, and women enjoy full political rights.

All opposition parties were excluded from the 2019 parliamentary contest. As of December 2022, three opposition parties had been permitted to register for the 2023 legislative elections.The FCBE was able to put forward a candidate for the 2021 presidential election.

The leader of a disqualified front of opposition parties, Joël Aïvo, was arrested shortly after the polls.",2,"Talon’s defeat of Lionel Zinsou, former president Thomas Boni Yayi’s chosen successor in the 2016 election, marked Benin’s fourth presidential transfer of power between rival groups since 1991. However, Talon’s government has since introduced significant obstacles to opposition parties and presidential candidates, and leading opposition figures have faced harassment and prosecution. Zinsou, Ajavon, and others have been sentenced in absentia to extensive sentences and remain in exile. Madougou and Aïvo were disqualified from the 2021 presidential ballot, arrested, and, in December of that year, sentenced to 20 and 10 years in prison, respectively. Approximately fifty members of the opposition imprisoned during 2021 were released in June and July 2022.

bolivia,"Citizens have the right to organize political parties. MAS has dominated politics since 2005, drawing support from social movements, trade unions, and civil society actors. Morales’s attempts to achieve a reelection bid were a core issue in the rancorous 2019 campaign period. The most prominent opposition party, Comunidad Ciudadana, attracted individuals who opposed his persistent efforts to extend his term. In January 2020, Luis Fernando Camacho—the regional leader from Santa Cruz who led the mass protests against Morales in 2019—founded the Creemos alliance. Creemos quickly became the leading party in Santa Cruz, Bolivia’s richest region, where Camacho was elected governor in 2021.",3,"There are no formal institutional barriers that prevent opposition parties from participating in elections. Between 2005 and 2019, however, the overwhelming dominance of MAS, aided by its use of public resources to back its campaigns, made it difficult for opposition parties to gain power through elections. MAS candidates achieved sweeping victories in the local elections held in March 2021, but lost the mayoral races in Bolivia’s largest cities, and in most gubernatorial races.Following the 2019 presidential election, the OAS observer mission claimed that the results of the vote were manipulated by the TSE to prevent a runoff between Morales and Mesa, the second-place candidate. However, in 2020, independent researchers found that methodological errors significantly affected the OAS’s results; when the errors were corrected, the researchers found no evidence of electoral fraud. Elections held in 2020 were generally considered to be free and fair.",2,"People are generally free to make political decisions without undue influence from the military, foreign powers, or other influential groups. Although several violent confrontations occurred between supporters of competing parties in the run-up to the 2020 election, leaders of all parties called for their supporters to allow everyone to campaign freely and peacefully in each region. The levels of violence that preceded and followed the 2019 elections have decreased in severity since 2020. However, tensions remained high into 2022, and violence between MAS supporters and supporters of the regionalist movement in Santa Cruz escalated after the Arce administration announced that a national census, originally planned for November 2022, would be postponed until 2024, purportedly due to administrative challenges. Due to the growing population of the Santa Cruz region, the census results are expected to trigger the reapportionment of government resources and parliamentary seats away from traditional MAS strongholds to Santa Cruz. By delaying the national census, opposition leaders say that the Arce administration has attempted to give unfair financial and parliamentary advantages to MAS. In November 2022, following several weeks of violent protests, the government agreed to hold the census in March 2024, roughly three months earlier than officials had originally announced.",2,"Adult citizens enjoy universal and equal suffrage. The constitution recognizes 36 Indigenous nationalities within a plurinational state, and formalizes political autonomy in Indigenous territories.

Formally, Bolivia has progressive legislation that guarantees equal political representation for women and seeks to protect them from political violence. While women are well represented in politics, holding 46 percent of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and nearly 56 percent of those in the Senate, sexism and patriarchal attitudes undermine their work, particularly at local levels.",3

The Russian and Turkish governments have also offered support to preferred parties and candidates. There are credible reports that the government of Croatia has intensively lobbied the OHR, especially with respect to Schmidt’s 2022 changes to the electoral code of the Federation entity.

In July 2022, local media reported that the Croatian foreign minister had helped directly prepare the OHR’s election law amendments.",2,"Political rights in BiH are in large part contingent on one’s ethnic background and place of residence. Jews and Roma are constitutionally barred from the presidency and from membership in the House of Peoples, despite the ECtHR rulings against those provisions. Serbs who live in the Federation and Croats and Bosniaks who live in the RS are also excluded from the presidency. Some Croats argue that their rights to representation are violated by electoral laws allowing non-Croats a significant voice in the selection of the Croat member of the presidency and Croat members of the House of Peoples. Critics of the Croat nationalist HDZ BiH, however, counter that the party has manipulated the discourse surrounding this issue to obstruct civic and liberal reforms of the country’s constitutional order. Women are underrepresented in politics and government. As a result, debates pertaining to maternal health and domestic violence are rarely at the center of parliamentary discussion, although they are openly, if infrequently, discussed in the media.

botswana,"The right of political parties to form and operate is legally guaranteed and is respected in practice. However, the opposition has alleged that the BDP abuses state resources, including the influential state media, to its own benefit.

The 2018 withdrawal of a provision that had increased candidates’ fees brought some relief to opposition parties. There were calls in 2022 during consultations on constitutional reform for laws to further regulate political-party funding.The UDC and its leader, Duma Boko, reported harassment and interference from government agencies during the 2019 election campaign, including the harassment of Boko’s family members and the impounding of a light aircraft used by the UDC for campaigning. The Directorate of Intelligence and Security Services (DISS) has also been accused of harassing opposition parliamentarians.In July 2020, amid concerns that BDP parliamentarians intended to join other parties, the government introduced a bill that would effectively prohibit local and national legislators from doing so.

brazil,"Brazil has an unfettered multiparty system marked by vigorous competition among rival parties. The electoral framework encourages the proliferation of parties, a number of which are based in a single state. Some parties display little ideological consistency. Lawmakers often switch parties, rendering electoral coalitions fragile. The executive branch must assemble diverse and often ideologically incoherent coalitions to pass legislation due to the large number of parties. Political parties operate with little transparency and under no governance rules, and often are targets of investigations into the misuse of public funds.Ahead of the 2022 elections, 32 parties were registered, 23 of which won seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

In the 2022 elections, the PL and the PT both gained significant levels of support. However, the Bolsonaro administration used public programs to bolster its campaign, reducing the opposition’s power to compete freely. The government increased the size of Auxílio Brasil (Brazil Aid) welfare payments between August and December 2022.

Others have chosen voluntary exile in France for fear of arrest. The government has reportedly considered banning dual nationals from serving as president or as an MP, a move that would affect two prominent opposition figures.",1,"Citizens are vulnerable to pressure and intimidation from national police and nonstate armed groups. Due to enduring insecurity, voters outside Bangui are largely unable to participate in political processes.The Russian regime maintains significant influence over the RCA’s political affairs. President Touadéra assigned his security to the Wagner Group, a Russian security company with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Wagner mercenaries have supported military operations and directly fought armed rebel groups, reportedly winning them public support. In March 2022, Russian diplomat Yevgeny Migunov told then Constitutional Court chief Darlan that the presidential term limit must be changed. Diplomats from Western countries later claimed that Moscow had called for the constitutional referendum announced in August.In 2021, the European Union sanctioned the Wagner Group, citing serious human rights abuses and destabilizing activities in the RCA. In March 2022, Michelle Bachelet Jeria, then the UN high commissioner for human rights, accused security forces and the Wagner Group of engaging in human rights violations.",0,"Members of many ethnic, religious, and other minority groups are prevented from achieving political representation due to discrimination and an accompanying lack of access to the political process. Sectarian violence against Muslims affects their ability to participate in public space.Women are underrepresented in politics, with only 18 women sitting in the 140-seat National Assembly, though the electoral law passed in 2019 requires that 35 percent of candidates be women. Societal and legal discrimination against LGBT+ people prevents them from advocating for their interests via the political process. Due to the long-lasting tribalization of politics, the country’s public institutions and army are dominated by the Gbaya ethnic majority, to which former president Bozizé belongs. President Touadéra has promoted members of his group, the Mbaka-Mandja, to key positions and to the presidential guard.",0
chad,"There are more than 130 registered political parties in Chad, though most have historically been aligned with the ruling party of former president Déby, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS). Opposition parties have legal recognition, and some members are represented in the transitional government and legislature. However, opposition parties remain subject to government harassment, intimidation, and arrest. During 2022, the authorities arrested leaders of prominent opposition groups following demonstrations against the junta and used violent repression to disperse and intimidate political activists. After the October protests, the government issued a curfew for major urban areas and a three-month ban on political activities.",1,"Chad has never experienced a peaceful rotation of power through elections, and repeated delays in holding elections have denied opposition groups an opportunity to compete with incumbent forces. After the October 2022 protests against the new two-year transition period, security forces continued to target the opposition and their headquarters with detentions and harassment. The opposition claimed that hundreds of their supporters had been detained or disappeared by year’s end.",0,"Extensive kinship networks tied to former president Déby had resulted in a concentration of political and economic power. The former government was not accountable to voters in practice, and citizens had few effective means of influencing politics. After the military, led by Déby’s son, took control in 2021, it suspended the constitution, perpetuating a historic pattern of military interventions in political affairs. The two-year extension to the transitional period in 2022 further postponed any shift toward electoral politics and voter participation.",0,"The transitional leadership has continued a long-standing practice of appointing members of the Beri or Zaghawa ethnic group to prominent positions within the government, causing resentment among the country’s other ethnic groups. The Beri make up less than 5 percent of Chad’s population. Many ethnic groups from the south have been largely excluded from political power; while some have held government posts, they had little ability to advocate for their communities or act independently from the MPS structure.Women have historically held few senior positions in government, and they face societal discrimination. LGBT+ people are severely marginalized, with minimal space for engagement in political processes or advocacy for their interests.",0
chile,"Chile has a multiparty political system in which parties operate freely. As of 2022, Congress includes representatives from 19 political parties, as well as several independent members.",4,"Power alternation between parties occurs regularly, both in Congress and for the presidency.",4,"People are generally free to exercise their political choices without undue influence from actors that are not democratically accountable. In recent years, however, far-right organizations such as Team Patriota and the Social Patriot Movement (MSP) have sought to influence Chilean politics, reportedly including by trying to exert pressure on conservative politicians.",4,"The Constitutional Convention elected in May 2021 featured gender parity among its 155 members, and 17 seats were reserved for members of Indigenous communities. The Constitutional Council set to be elected in 2023 will also feature gender parity among its 50 members, but does not have a set number of seats reserved for Indigenous representatives. Women are represented in government, and the electoral system includes a quota for women in the legislature. However, women have reported difficulty gaining influence in intraparty debates. President Boric has made gender parity a core focus of his administration; his first cabinet, announced in January 2022, was made up of 14 women and 10 men. Following changes made within the government in September, Boric’s cabinet comprised 15 women and 9 men. The interests of the Mapuche minority, which represents about 9 percent of the population, are present in political life, with Mapuche activists regularly making their voices heard in street demonstrations. However, this activism has yet to translate into significant legislative power. Members of the LGBT+ community are organized in civil society organizations but few are elected to political positions.",3
china,"The CCP effectively monopolizes all political activity and does not permit meaningful political competition. Eight small noncommunist parties are represented in the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an official advisory body, but their activities are tightly circumscribed, and they must accept the CCP’s leadership as a condition for their existence.Citizens who have sought to establish genuinely independent political parties or prodemocracy movements are nearly all in prison, under house arrest, or in exile. The authorities continue to hold prodemocracy activists and lawyers in various forms of detention and prison. New Citizens’ Movement founder and legal activist Xu Zhiyong, in detention since February 2020, was reportedly tried in secret for “subversion” in June 2022.",0,"China’s one-party system provides no institutional mechanism for organized political opposition, and the CCP has ruled without interruption since winning a civil war against the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) in 1949. While factions within the CCP have always existed, they do not compete openly or democratically, and they remain unaccountable to the public. Xi Jinping has steadily increased his personal power and authority within the party since 2012, notably by purging rivals and challengers as part of an anticorruption campaign.",0,The authoritarian CCP is not accountable to voters and denies the public any meaningful participation in political affairs. The party uses a broad array of coercive tools and methods to suppress independent political engagement.,0,"The political system is dominated in practice by ethnic Han Chinese men. Societal groups such as women, ethnic and religious minorities, and LGBT+ people have no opportunity to gain meaningful political representation. Nominal representatives of ethnic minority groups such as Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Mongolians hold administrative offices and participate in party and state bodies like the NPC, but their role is largely symbolic. Women are severely underrepresented in top CCP and government positions. For the first time in 25 years no women will sit on China’s Politburo, after the 20th Party Congress failed to name any in 2022. No woman has ever sat on the PSC.",0
colombia,"Colombia’s historically rigid two-party system has begun to diversify in recent years. It continued to do so in 2022, with candidates representing a wide range of parties—including new groups that emerged without obstruction—freely competing in the year’s presidential and legislative elections. Opposition leader Gustavo Petro of the new PH party won the presidency in 2022 and garnered the support of a broad coalition of leftist politicians and civil society leaders, as well as seasoned politicians who broke from their traditional parties. Three former political parties that had become defunct due to conflict-related violence returned to contest the 2022 elections after being reinstated by a December 2021 court ruling; similar redress is available for other political parties unduly impacted by the conflict.",4,"Democratic transfers of power between rival parties are routine at both the national level and in many regions, though significant areas remain under the long-term control of machine-style political clans with ties to organized crime. Following the 2022 presidential elections, opposition leader Gustavo Petro became Colombia’s first leftist president and his PH party left the congressional opposition to lead the new governing coalition. Numerous prominent politicians occupy the political space between the extremes of Petro and the CD. ",4,"After decades of political violence and insecurity around elections, the 2018 and 2022 elections were peaceful and safe for most voters. In limited areas, however, and despite the peace accord with the FARC, activity by the smaller ELN leftist guerrilla group, the successors of previously disbanded right-wing paramilitary groups, so-called “dissident” FARC members, and criminal gangs has continued to impair the ability of citizens to participate freely in the political process.",2,"Women enjoy equal political rights, and at least 30 percent of the candidates on party lists must be women. Following the March 2022 legislative elections, the share of congressional seats held by women increased to 29 percent. Following the 2022 presidential elections, Francia Márquez became the first Afro-Colombian vice president and the second woman to hold the post. Colombia’s Congress has historically disregarded women’s issues, but in 2021 legislators passed several laws intended to improve social and economic conditions for women, including on issues of family violence and employment opportunities. Though LGBT+ people’s rights are legally protected and there are LGBT+ representatives in government, LGBT+ individuals are marginalized in the political sphere.Lighter-skinned Colombians occupy a disproportionate share of government posts. While progress remains slow, the government has undertaken a series of steps to incorporate Indigenous and Afro-Colombian voices into national political debates in recent years. The 2016 peace accord included provisions for improving consultation mechanisms for marginalized groups, but issues affecting Afro-Colombians and Indigenous groups are rarely priorities in national policymaking.",3
comoros,"Political parties are mainly formed around specific leaders and draw on island or ethnic bases of support. In the past, parties generally operated freely, though the government occasionally disrupted opposition parties’ activities by denying them meeting and assembly space.The authorities systematically cracked down on opposition figures who publicly criticized the 2018 constitutional referendum. The former governor of Anjouan, Abdou Salami Abdou, who had been in pretrial detention since his October 2018 arrest, was tried and sentenced to 12 years in prison in March 2022 for allegedly participating in an insurrection, disturbing public order, and undermining national unity. Observers have called the former governor a political prisoner.Presidential candidates Achmet Said Mohamed and Soilihi Mohamed were briefly detained in March 2019, though both were later released. Soilihi, who led a National Transitional Council (CNT) that unsuccessfully attempted to force Azali from office through civil disobedience and industrial action, agreed to refrain from further involvement after his release that April. In February 2022, the government launched a national dialogue intended to build consensus on political and socioeconomic issues. The Inter-Comorian National Dialogue, which concluded in March, reportedly submitted a number of recommendations to the government, including on political reforms. The dialogue was boycotted by a majority of the opposition, some of whom likened participation in the dialogue to offering President Azali a “blank check” to pursue his own political agenda.",2,"In the past, numerous opposition parties had a realistic chance of gaining power through elections, though they were impeded by occasional government interference. Allegations of misuse of state resources by incumbents were not uncommon. However, the arrests, convictions, and harsh sentences against opposition leaders who spoke out against the 2018 constitutional referendum hampered the ability of opposition parties to compete in elections. The 2020 legislative elections, which were marred by an opposition boycott, ended with progovernment candidates winning every seat.",1,"While individuals are generally free to exercise their political choices, the influence of Comoros’s powerful army—which cracked down on dissent during the 2018 constitutional referendum—as well as of religious authorities can place pressure on voters and candidates.The army was used to intimidate and detain opposition figures during and after the 2019 presidential campaign. Gendarmes arrested Soilihi after he announced his CNT involvement that March. Gendarmes also interrogated the spouse of presidential candidate Achmet, who served as a CNT spokesperson, that April.",2,"There are no laws preventing various segments of the population from enjoying full political rights and electoral opportunities. However, traditional attitudes discourage women from participating in politics. Only four women won legislative seats in the 2020 polls. Legal and societal discrimination against LGBT+ people makes political advocacy for LGBT+ rights difficult.",2
republic-congo,"Political groupings exist, but the government represses those not aligned with the PCT, including by persecuting their leaders. In 2016, opposition leader Paulin Makaya of the United for Congo (UPC) party was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for inciting disorder over his participation in protests against the constitutional referendum. Makaya was released in 2018 but was blocked from leaving the country on several occasions; Makaya was allowed to seek medical treatment abroad in 2021.Sassou Nguesso’s two most prominent opponents in the 2016 presidential election received prison terms after that contest. In 2018, retired general Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment for threatening state security. In 2019, André Okombi Salissa, who had led the opposition Initiative for Democracy in Congo coalition, was sentenced to 20 years of forced labor for the same charge.Private campaign contributions are banned, leaving opposition parties and candidates dependent on limited public financing.Political parties are sometimes denied registration without cause. In 2020, the government suspended a number of parties, including the UPC, excluding them from its list of approved parties.",1,"There is little opportunity for the opposition to gain power through elections, and opposition leaders frequently experience harassment, intimidation, and arrest. During the 2016 presidential race, opposition candidates Mokoko and Okombi Salissa were repeatedly harassed and were subsequently imprisoned. In 2021, Kolélas complained of movement restrictions, while authorities cancelled some campaign events.",0,"The Sassou Nguesso government routinely uses military and police forces to intimidate citizens. Employers engage in widespread discrimination in hiring and regarding other decisions, based on political beliefs.",0,"Although there are no legal restrictions on political participation by religion, gender, sexual identity, or ethnic group, members of Sassou Nguesso’s northern Mbochi ethnic group occupy key government posts. Insofar as the government includes representatives from other regional and ethnic groups, their ability to shape policy is very limited. The government routinely suppresses political parties that draw support from Congo’s southern regions, which have long opposed Sassou Nguesso.Women, whose political participation is limited by societal constraints, are underrepresented in government. Women won only 25 National Assembly seats in the July 2022 elections and held only 13 Senate seats as of year’s end. Evelyne Tchitchelle of the PCT became the country’s first female mayor when she was elected in Pointe-Noire in September 2022. Tchitchelle had not been sworn in by year’s end.",1

Afro–Costa Ricans, who make up almost 8 percent of the population, are also underrepresented in government. Women and women’s interests are represented in government, with approximately 47 percent of seats in the Legislative Assembly held by women.",3
cote-divoire,"The Ivorian constitution permits multiparty competition. Recent presidential and legislative elections have been contested by a large number of parties and independent candidates. The ruling RHDP, dominated by Ouattara’s Rally of the Republicans (RDR), holds a virtual lock on political power but has faced increased competition in recent years. In 2018, the PDCI of former president Bédié broke away from a coalition with the RHDP. Guillaume Soro, meanwhile, formed the GPS after being pressured into resigning as National Assembly speaker in 2019.In contrast to the 2020 presidential elections—which had been boycotted by several leading opposition parties—competition improved in 2021, with multiple parties participating in that year’s parliamentary elections. More parties have been formed since those polls. In June 2021, former president Laurent Gbagbo returned to Côte d’Ivoire after 10 years, following his acquittal by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of crimes against humanity; he launched the African People’s Party–Côte d’Ivoire, a left-wing pan-African party, that October. The Ivorian Popular Front, which he founded in exile in 1982, remains active. Former first lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo formed the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC) in 2021 and was named party leader in August 2022.",3,"Opposition parties have little chance of gaining power without reforming the electoral framework, which favors the ruling party. The RHDP has an absolute majority in the National Assembly, limiting the opposition’s ability to pursue such reforms.Opposition groups’ chances to meaningfully contest the 2020 presidential election were dashed that August when the Constitutional Council rejected the candidacy of 40 of the 44 parties and individuals who submitted a nomination, including Soro and Laurent Gbagbo. International observer missions noted there was no appeals process for rejected candidates. The government ignored the ACHPR’s ruling to accept Soro’s and Gbagbo’s candidacies. Opposition figures were arrested and detained by security forces after the 2020 election took place, while dissidents were arrested for participating in protests during that year’s electoral period.",2,"Individuals faced intimidation, threats, and physical violence when participating in the 2020 presidential election. Those who held protests despite the government’s ban faced forceful reprisals, with several demonstrators being killed during the campaigning period. Members of leading civil society institutions, like academics, suggested that participating in public debate about the elections would be seen as protest by their superiors.Supporters of the opposition faced threats from the police and the military, while militia members engaged in violence and enjoyed impunity. Party-linked militias refrained from such violence during the relatively peaceful and transparent March 2021 parliamentary elections, however.",2,"Citizenship has been a source of tension since the 1990s, when Ivorian nationalists adopted former president Bédié’s concept of “Ivoirité” to exclude perceived foreigners, including Ouattara, from the political process. A law relaxing some conditions for citizenship went into effect in 2014 but its application remains uneven. Hundreds of thousands of individuals, mostly northerners, lack documentation.Women are poorly represented in the parliament, holding 13.7 percent of National Assembly seats and 21.4 percent of the Senate as of December 2022.A north-south, Muslim-Christian schism has been a salient feature of Ivorian life for decades and was exacerbated by the 2002–11 crisis. However, the schism has since receded, and the current governing coalition includes Muslims and Christians. Political parties are not ethnically homogenous—Côte d’Ivoire comprises people from more than 60 ethnicities—though each tends to be dominated by specific ethnic groups.",2
croatia,Citizens may freely organize and participate in the activities of a wide variety of political parties. A slate of new right- and left-wing populist parties and candidates emerged in the 2019 European Parliament elections. Two new coalitions made breakthroughs in the July 2020 parliamentary polls: the far-right Homeland Movement and the left-wing We Can.,4,"The SDP-led opposition coalition holds a significant bloc of parliamentary seats and is generally able to operate free from restrictions or intimidation. However, the HDZ has dominated politics and draws support from the Catholic Church, veterans, and a growing number of conservative nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The SDP-led bloc has won the most seats in only two parliamentary elections since 1991, although the country was headed by non-HDZ executives between 2000 and 2015. SDP-backed candidates served as president from 2010 to 2015 and again since 2020. President Milanović, who was elected in 2020, campaigned from the right instead of relying only on the SDP’s traditional base of support.",4,"While voters and candidates are generally able to freely express their political choices, many public servants obtained their positions through patronage networks and risk becoming beholden to a party or special interest group as a result. Patronage networks are particularly influential in Zagreb, which was under the almost-continuous stewardship of HDZ-affiliated mayor Milan Bandić—considered one of the country’s most powerful politicians—between 2000 and his death in 2021. Bandić’s tenure was marked by corruption accusations and credible allegations of improper hiring practices and public procurement deals. The influential Catholic Church associates with conservative and far-right civil society groups, which have become more influential in local politics in recent years. Veterans’ groups are also significant, especially in regard to the still-contentious discourse surrounding the 1991–95 Independence War and the position of ethnic Serbs in Croatian society.",3,"Eight parliamentary seats are set aside for ethnic minorities, including three for ethnic Serbs. However, the political interests of marginalized groups, notably Roma and Serbs, are underrepresented. Another three seats are reserved for Croatian citizens in the diaspora, including ethnic Croats in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Women are represented across political parties, and women have held Croatia’s presidency between 2015 and 2019 and the prime minister’s office between 2009 and 2011. However, the number of women in the parliament decreased in 2016 after the Constitutional Court struck down a law requiring 40 percent of a party’s candidates be women. In the 2020 parliamentary election, 35 women won seats in the parliament.Ethnic Serbs in public office are subjected to mistreatment, with Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS) leader Milorad Pupovac receiving verbal attacks in recent years. SDS election posters have been defaced during both European Parliament and Croatian elections. Societal discrimination discourages LGBT+ people from participating in politics, and elements of the political establishment have espoused discriminatory attitudes in their activism.",3
cuba,"The constitution identifies the PCC as the “superior driving force of society and the state.” All other political parties are illegal. Political dissent is a punishable offense, and dissidents are systematically harassed, detained, physically assaulted, and imprisoned for minor infractions. Supposedly spontaneous mob attacks, known as “acts of repudiation,” are often used to silence political dissidents. Madrid-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) Prisoners Defenders reported that more than 1,000 political prisoners were being held by Cuban authorities as of the end of November 2022. That number far exceeds the figures of other allied and similar regimes in Latin America, including Nicaragua and Venezuela.",0,"The PCC has monopolized government and politics in Cuba since the mid-1960s, allowing no electoral competition and preventing any alternative force from succeeding it through a democratic transfer of power. Security forces suppressed opposition activity during both the February 2019 constitutional referendum and the October 2019 election of Díaz-Canel. Municipal elections held in November 2022 featured only one opposition candidate out of the more than 26,000 nominated; earlier that month, opposition groups, who said that the government had blocked opposition candidates from participating, called on voters to boycott the polls.",0,"The authoritarian one-party system in Cuba excludes the public from any genuine, autonomous political participation. Intelligence agencies play an important role in suppressing dissent and wield deep influence over virtually every aspect of the state. Members of dissident groups and even independent actors in the arts, journalism, and other fields are systematically surveilled and periodically interrogated in order to silence them or turn them into informants.State employees who express political dissent or disagreement with the authorities often face harassment or summary dismissal. Professionals dismissed from their jobs in the state sector have difficulty continuing their careers.",0,"The PCC leadership has exhibited greater gender and racial diversity in recent years. However, since political rights are denied to all Cuban citizens, women, Afro-Cubans, and members of other demographic groups are unable to choose their representatives or organize independently to assert their political interests. Women hold more than half of the 605 National Assembly seats. However, women held only 3 seats in the 12-seat Political Bureau of the PCC Central Committee during the April 2021 party congress. Cubans of African and mixed-race descent are well represented in the legislature. Lazo, an Afro-Cuban PCC stalwart, simultaneously holds the powerful positions of National Assembly president and head of the Council of State. The political interests of LGBT+ people are not well represented. Some public advocacy is permitted, but only with the permission of the PCC.",0

However, in the 2019 European Parliament (EP) elections, AKEL’s Niyazi Kızılyürek became the first Turkish Cypriot to be elected to the EP or to win office in the Republic of Cyprus since 1964.Women in Cyprus have equal political rights, but sexism and patriarchal attitudes discourage them from playing a more active role in politics. No parliamentary party is led by a woman, and parties have failed to meet internal quotas mandating that 30 to 35 percent of their candidates be women. Only eight women were elected to the parliament in 2021, a decline from the 2016 results. Nevertheless, that year Annita Demetriou of DISY became the first woman to be elected as speaker of the Cypriot parliament.The interests of the LGBT+ community, which still faces significant discrimination from some sectors of society, are not always well represented in the political system.Immigrants have some access to naturalization procedures and the political rights associated with citizenship, generally requiring several years of legal residency to apply.

Minority groups, including the Afar, Yemeni Arabs, and non-Issa Somalis, are represented at all levels of the government, but the president’s majority Issa group holds paramount positions in the ruling party, the civil service, and the security forces. Members of the Afar community are marginalized and in response have formed groups such as the militant FRUD-Armé, a splinter group of the Front for the Restoration and Democracy political party that has attacked government installations throughout Djibouti. Women are underrepresented in leadership positions. A legal quota ensures that women hold at least 25 percent of the seats in the National Assembly, and the actual number is only slightly above that level. In practice, the authoritarian political system restricts the ability of women and members of ethnic and religious minorities to organize independently and advance their respective interests.",1

Over the years, political parties seeking legal recognition have suffered court defeats.A number of prodemocracy organizations and trade unions have continued to lobby for political reforms and have publicly challenged Mswati’s grip on power, even given the serious risks involved. The government has used increasingly repressive tactics to stifle rising prodemocracy activism in recent years; those calling for political reform often face arbitrary arrest, harassment, and assault at the hands of security forces, who regularly use excessive force. In July 2021, two prodemocracy members of Parliament, Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube, were arrested on specious terrorism charges amid a government crackdown on political dissent following the widespread antigovernment protests that began that May.

In May 2021, the House of Peoples’ Representatives designated the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and “OLF-Shene”—the government term for Oromo Liberation Army (OLA)—as terrorist organizations, accusing them (with credible evidence) of carrying out acts of politically motivated violence against government officials and civilian targets based on their ethnic identity. Consequently, thousands of Tigrayans and Oromos accused of being affiliated with the TPLF or OLA have faced arrest and other pressure.

Key opposition groups including the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), and the OLF boycotted the 2021 elections, citing electoral mismanagement and harassment by the ruling party.",1,"The designation in 2021 of the TPLF and the OLA as terrorist organizations has been detrimental to the political support bases of the parties. The TPLF had dominated national and regional politics in Tigray for the past three decades. The military conflict against the OLA and the government’s crackdown on opposition members and supporters following the 2020 Hundessa assassination further limited Oromo people’s political rights.Similarly, the government has used the 2021 designation of the OLA as a terrorist organization to crack down on nonviolent opposition supporters and members under the pretext of affiliation with terrorists.The Tigray conflict with the TPLF also led Prime Minister Abiy to seek external military and political support from President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea.

Bainimarama stepped aside and became the leader of the opposition, despite having said in the past that he would not allow opposition parties to assume office in the event that FijiFirst was defeated. The military commander, Major General Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai, has promised to abide by the election result.In the lead-up to the December 2022 election, the government targeted many opposition figures with accusations of corruption, breach of election law, and other wrongdoing.

In the immediate aftermath of the December 2022 election, the commissioner of police, Brigadier-General Sitiveni Qiliho, citing claims of impending ethnic unrest and tension, called for a deployment of the RFMF in Suva. The RFMF accepted the call, but the military commander repeatedly promised to abide by the election result.",2,"The law does not restrict the participation of minorities and women in politics.

Of the 12 violent incidents recorded during the December 2020 elections, including those that resulted in five deaths, in only 2 cases had perpetrators been held accountable by the end of 2022.",3,"Ghanaian laws provide for equal participation in political life by the country’s various cultural, religious, and ethnic groups.

In 2012, the Democratic Left (DIMAR) split off from the Synaspismós party and joined a coalition government with PASOK and ND. In 2015, the radical left party SYRIZA, which saw its power increase during the financial crisis, won the parliamentary election. Together with the far-right party Independent Greeks (ANEL), a splinter party of ND, SYRIZA created a coalition that regained power and formed a government in September 2015.",4,No group or institution from outside the political system exerts undue influence over the choices of voters and candidates.,4,"Greece’s largest recognized minority population, the Muslim community of Thrace, has full political rights, and three members of the community won seats in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The authorities have rejected some ethnic groups’ attempts to secure official recognition or to register associations with names referring to their ethnic identity, affecting their ability to organize and advocate for their political interests, though such associations are generally able to operate without legal recognition. Since 2010, documented immigrants have been allowed to vote in municipal elections.Though there are no significant legal or practical barriers to women’s political participation, women only hold a little more than a fifth of the seats in parliament and sexist and patriarchal attitudes dissuade their active participation.

Weak campaign finance laws potentially create an unfair advantage for certain parties.",4,"There are realistic opportunities for opposition parties to increase their support or gain power through elections, and power has rotated on several occasions since democracy was restored to Grenada in 1984. The NNP has won a majority of the elections since then, and the NDC failed to win any seats in the House of Representatives in the 2013 and 2018 elections.",4,"People are generally able to express their political choices without encountering pressure from outside actors. However, the OAS has expressed concern about a lack of transparency and regulation of campaign finance procedures, which could create avenues for undue influence over candidates and voters by business or other special interest groups.",4,"Grenada’s constitution guarantees universal suffrage for adult citizens. Political representation largely reflects a population that is over 90 percent of African or mixed descent. However, other ethnic groups have a voice in politics and are represented in Parliament.Women remain underrepresented in politics, with women winning only 5 of the lower house’s 15 seats in the June 2022 polls. OAS observers reporting on those polls noted that “a high level of violence against women, fear of victimization, societal backlash for entering politics, and unpaid care-work” inhibit female participation.

guatemala,"Political groups and organizations generally operate without encountering legal restrictions. However, new groups sometimes face bureaucratic delays from the TSE when attempting to register.

Poor enforcement of party finance regulations has allowed some candidates and parties access to vast resources.",3,"Elections at the national and local levels are competitive, and new parties routinely gain significant quotas of power. Guatemalan politics are unstable, and power rotates between parties frequently, which can discourage a traditional opposition from coalescing. At least 10 candidates were killed during the 2019 election period.",3,"Verbal harassment and physical violence against voters are common during elections and can deter political participation. Weak enforcement of campaign finance regulations has permitted lopsided resource advantages, as well as financing of candidates by special interests and organized criminal groups, distorting the political choices of citizens. Direct vote buying and use of public funds to influence the outcome of elections is also common. Observers reported that armed groups and criminal organizations have attempted to sway the results of local races.",2,"Members of ethnic and other minority groups struggle to fully exercise their political rights. There are no affirmative measures in place to promote the election of representatives of Indigenous peoples, who are underrepresented despite accounting for as much as 60 percent of the population. There are 16 Indigenous members of Congress, 4 of whom are women; approximately 25 percent of mayors elected in 2019 were Indigenous. No Indigenous persons or Afro-Guatemalans currently hold cabinet-level positions.Women are underrepresented in politics, though small women’s rights groups have some visibility in the political sphere. Giammattei appointed three women ministers to his cabinet but two left their posts. Women hold only 31 seats in Congress, and only 11 mayorships out of 340.The first openly gay man to enter Congress was elected in 2019; since then, he has been the target of attacks and homophobic messages, including from the president and fellow legislators.

guinea,"More than 150 political parties were officially recognized as of December 2021, with most having clear ethnic or regional bases of support. Article 6 of the transitional charter establishes the right for political parties to freely form. In practice, the operations of political parties are increasingly restricted under the junta, which in 2022 dismantled the country’s largest opposition group.In May 2022, the junta banned all political demonstrations “as long as public order cannot be guaranteed.” This announcement effectively targeted the activities of the National Front for the Defense of the Constitution (FNDC), a coalition of civil society groups, political parties, and labor unions, which accuse the junta of authoritarian practices. In July, the government initiated legal proceedings against three FNDC leaders, who subsequently were arrested. In August the government formally dissolved the FNDC. The FNDC and other organizations such as the National Alliance for Alteration and Democracy (ANAD) and the formerly ruling Rally for the Guinean People (RPG) no longer participate in the dialogue with the junta.In October, security forces used live ammunition against protesters calling for the return of civilian rule, and detained numerous FNDC sympathizers.",1,"The interim government rules through violence and intimidation. Because the political reconstruction process is controlled by President Doumbouya and his junta, the opposition appears to stand only a very limited chance to increase support or gain through elections. The date of the next elections has yet to be determined.In 2022, security forces frequently attacked rallies and protests organized by the opposition, making it more difficult for opposition parties to mobilize their supporters. The government formally dissolved the main opposition movement in August.",1,"Previously, Condé’s administration had reduced the influence of the military in politics, but the Special Forces (GFS), claimed power in 2021 and Doumbouya, the officer who led the GFS and the coup, became the interim president.Ethnic loyalty played an outsized role in the political choices of voters and party leaders under Condé. Rather than organizing around policy platforms or political ideologies and trying to attract new supporters, each party tacitly pledged allegiance to its respective ethnic group, contributing to the threat of mutual hostility and violence.There is widespread speculation that foreign-owned mining interests in Guinea, including Russian and Turkish operations, backed Condé and now back Doumbouya because they view him as best positioned to protect their interests.",1,"Women and members of ethnic and religious minority groups have full political rights under the law, but ethnic divisions and gender bias limit their participation in practice. Under a law passed in 2019, women must constitute 50 percent of electoral lists. Female representation in the National Assembly stood at only 16.7 percent prior to the 2021 coup. The transitional charter included a 30 percent gender quota for the CNT, which is implemented in practice. Members of the LGBT+ community are poorly represented in political life.",2
guinea-bissau,"There are no major constraints on party formation. Dozens of political parties are active in Guinea-Bissau, and 21 competed in the 2019 parliamentary elections, up from 15 in 2014. However, the political crisis since 2015—when former president Vaz dismissed then prime minister Pereira—has led to some instances of violence and intimidation among partisan groups.PAIGC leader and former presidential candidate Pereira was repeatedly prevented from leaving Guinea-Bissau on dubious grounds during 2022. The government initially claimed that Pereira was barred from leaving the country because he was the subject of an ongoing judicial investigation. However, authorities continued to prevent Pereira from leaving the country in September, even after a court order revoked earlier restraining measures that had required him to stay in Guinea-Bissau. Pereira was ultimately allowed to leave the country later that month. During 2022, the PAIGC was repeatedly blocked from holding a party conference, which was initially scheduled to be held in February. In February, PAIGC militant Bolom Conté legally challenged Pereira’s right to organize the congress, saying that his mandate as party leader had ended; the court sided with Conté, and issued an order forbidding the party to hold its congress. The court order was enforced in March when police violently raided PAIGC headquarters to prevent the congress from occurring, wounding at least seven people and arresting several others. Pereira accused President Embaló of pressuring the judiciary to block the congress, which was ultimately held in November and saw Pereira reelected as party leader.In May 2022, UM party leader Agnelo Regala was shot at outside his home by unknown individuals. The Attorney General’s Office (PGR) announced that the matter would be investigated.",3,"Guinea-Bissau has a limited record of democratic power transfers between rival political parties, as the PAIGC or military rulers have governed for most of the period since independence. In 2014, Vaz succeeded an independent who had served as acting president in the wake of the 2012 coup. Nevertheless, opposition forces increased their representation in the 2019 legislative elections. President Embaló of the new party Madem G15 succeeded former president Vaz of the PAIGC following the 2019 presidential election. However, Embaló’s use of the military to complete his installation in office raised concerns.",2,"The military has apparently refrained from interfering in politics since 2014, though it was used by President Embaló to complete his installment in office. The choices of voters and politicians continue to be influenced by corruption and patronage networks. Organized crime linked to drug trafficking and money laundering has contributed to the country’s political instability in recent decades. In February 2022, while President Embaló was leading a cabinet meeting at the government palace, a group of armed men surrounded the building and opened fire. Officials reported that 11 people—mostly government security personnel—were killed during the alleged coup attempt. Several people were arrested in connection with the attack, which Embaló claimed was planned by drug traffickers. The trial of 25 people allegedly involved in the attack was initially scheduled to take place in December, but had been postponed as of year’s end.Several of Embaló’s opponents—including PAIGC leader Pereira and Luís Vaz Martins, the former president of the Guinean League of Human Rights (LGDH)—have expressed doubts that the attack represented a genuine coup attempt. Some analysts believe Embaló may have orchestrated the coup himself, possibly in the hope that ECOWAS would send troops to help keep his government in power. In response to the February attack, an ECOWAS “stabilization force” was deployed to Guinea-Bissau in June to help local law enforcement protect public officials and government institutions and prevent further violence.",1,"Women enjoy equal political rights, but cultural obstacles limit their participation in practice, and they are underrepresented in leadership positions. Just 14 women won seats in the March 2019 parliamentary elections. A 2018 law requires 36 percent of candidates on party lists to be women.Ethnicity plays a role in politics, reducing the extent to which all groups’ interests are represented.

The number of members required to form a political party was reduced from 500 to 20 in 2014, leading to the creation of dozens of parties. However, pervasive insecurity and criminal violence impair political activity. Opposition leaders are subject to threats and abductions, and protests organized by opposition parties are regularly met with repressive force by authorities. Political actors have long employed criminal gangs to impede their opponents, further restricting competition.Criminal violence is pervasive. In December 2022, the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) reported that over 1,200 kidnappings took place during the year, over twice as many as in 2021. Gangs continue to control neighborhoods and strategic roads connecting Port-au-Prince to the rest of the country.",1,"Haiti has a poor record of peaceful democratic transfers of power. It remains difficult for the opposition to increase its support or gain power through elections, which are regularly disrupted by violence, marred by accusations of fraud, and postponed. The PHTK consolidated power in the legislature and at the local level, in part through alliances with smaller parties, before national and local mandates expired. ",1,"Haitians’ political choices are marginalized by corrupt patronage networks, organized crime, and foreign actors. Many politicians have relied on money linked to drug trafficking, gang activity, and other illegal sources to finance their campaigns. The PHTK and opposition parties have enlisted armed criminal groups to either incite or halt residents’ involvement in protests and other political activities, according to local human rights activists.Citizens’ democratic autonomy was further harmed by the assassination of President Moïse and its aftermath. In addition to the violence and criminality associated with the murder itself, many observers decried the role of the Core Group—comprising ambassadors or representatives from Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, the United States, the European Union, the Organization of American States, and the United Nations—in accepting Henry as prime minister.",1,"Haitian women are underrepresented in political life, with only four out of 149 parliamentary seats held by women from 2017 to 2019.

Opposition parties are disadvantaged by the politicized distortion of the advertising market, including the market for the country’s many billboards.Individual politicians face smear campaigns in progovernment media outlets, and the government has taken steps to split the opposition vote in recent elections. Authorities have also interfered with opposition figures’ peaceful political activities.Parliament further amended the electoral framework in 2020, requiring political parties field candidates in 71 (instead of 27) single-member constituencies on a single list, forcing opposition parties to combine and field one consolidated list of candidates in the 2022 general elections. The government also maintains effective control of the State Audit Office (ÁSZ), which monitors campaign activities and party spending. In recent years, the ÁSZ has imposed sanctions on opposition parties for financial irregularities, while condoning or overlooking problematic spending of state subsidies by Fidesz.",3,"Fidesz has dominated the political landscape since the 2010 election. Opposition parties contended with even more obstacles and restrictions that detracted from their ability to gain power in the 2022 elections, despite banding together to present one unified slate of candidates. These included unequal access to media, smear campaigns, politicized audits, and a campaign environment skewed by the ruling coalition’s mobilization of state resources.The OSCE found a pervasive overlap between ruling coalition resources and government resources. The government used email addresses collected for pandemic-related communications to disseminate campaign messages and distorted information about the opposition’s position regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Third-party spending, especially in social media, also strongly benefitted the ruling coalition. Fidesz-KDNP candidates were not willing to engage in televised debates with their opponents.",2,"Individuals are largely able to participate in public affairs without encountering undue influence over their political choices. However, Fidesz has increasingly harnessed its members’ political and economic power to sideline opposition groups and prevent them from presenting a meaningful challenge to its dominant position.

Only 26 of 199 National Assembly members and 1 out of 14 cabinet ministers are women following the 2022 elections. Ruling party ministers and progovernment media occasionally make derogatory and sexist remarks toward women parliamentarians.Hungary’s constitution guarantees the right of ethnic minority populations to form self-governing bodies, and all 13 recognized minorities have done so. Minorities can also register to vote for special minority lists—with a preferential vote threshold—in parliamentary elections. Minorities without a parliamentary mandate can send a “national minority advocate” to the parliament without voting rights. Only 1 of the 13 recognized minorities managed to elect a representative with voting rights to the National Assembly in 2022.Roma have long been underrepresented in politics and government and have been the target of derogatory rhetoric from Fidesz members in recent years.Though individual opposition politicians have openly supported equal rights for LGBT+ people, and the party Momentum has done so explicitly, LGBT+ people’s interests are not successfully represented in the parliament. The April 2022 polls included a referendum on a “child protection” law, a euphemism for provisions of another recently passed anti-LGBT+ law that bans any portrayal of LGBT+ people in materials meant for children.

india,"Political parties are generally able to form without interference, and a wide variety of parties representing a range of views and interests compete in practice. However, the ruling BJP has used various tools to limit campaigning by opposition parties.The opaque financing of political parties is a serious source of concern. A system of electoral bonds, introduced in 2017, allows donor identities to be known to the State Bank of India but obscured from the public. It has contributed to major fundraising advantages for the BJP. In addition, the government, through the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has selectively pursued anticorruption investigations against opposition politicians while overlooking allegations against political allies. In September 2022, the Indian Express reported that the CBI investigated opposition politicians since the BJP came to power far more often, while fewer members of the ruling party were targeted.",3,"Different parties regularly succeed one another in government at the state and national levels. Modi and the BJP took power after the 2014 elections, ending 10 years of INC-led government, and were reelected by a wide margin in 2019.

Separately, some political actors have sought to inflame communal tensions with the goal of energizing their own supporters while potentially intimidating opponents.",3,"Women and members of religious and ethnic minorities vote in large numbers and have opportunities to gain political representation. In 2019, for the first time, the rate of women’s voting in national elections equaled that of men. Indian lawmakers selected the country’s second-ever woman president when voting for Droupadi Murmu in July 2022. Female representation in the Lok Sabha, however, is low. Women held 15.1 percent of its seats as of December.Quotas ensure that 84 and 47 Lok Sabha seats are reserved for the so-called scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, respectively. State assemblies and local bodies feature similar quotas for these historically disadvantaged groups, as well as for women representatives.However, marginalized segments of the population continue to face practical obstacles to full political representation. Muslim candidates notably won 27 of 545 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, up from 22 previously. However, this amounted to just 5 percent of the seats in the chamber, whereas Muslims made up some 14.2 percent of the population according to the 2011 census. By the end of 2022, no national legislator belonging to the BJP identified as Muslim.The political rights of India’s Muslims continue to be threatened. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) of 2019 grants special access to Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants and refugees from neighboring Muslim-majority states. At the same time, the government moved forward with plans for the creation of a national register of citizens. Many observers believe that the register’s purpose is to disenfranchise Muslim voters by effectively classifying them as illegal immigrants. Importantly, Muslims disproportionately lack documentation attesting to their place of birth. Undocumented non-Muslims, meanwhile, are eligible for citizenship through a fast-track process under the CAA.The citizenship status of 1.9 million residents of Assam, which is home to a significant Muslim population, remains in doubt after a citizens’ register was finalized in the northeastern state in 2019.",2

Despite its military force and loyal personnel, the Coordination Framework lost significant representation in 2021, demonstrating the ability of Iraqi voters to affect Parliament’s makeup, even if they cannot shift the balance of armed power in the country. However, the resignation of Sadrist lawmakers in June 2022 again shifted the balance of power in Parliament in favor of the Coordination Framework.In 2022, KRG authorities continued their repression of the activities of the New Generation party and its affiliated media outlet, Nalia Radio and Television (NRT), owned by New Generation party leader Shaswar Abdulwahid.",2,"Iraq’s political system remains distorted by interference from foreign powers, most notably Iran; Iranian authorities physically and politically threaten or buy the support of Iraqi policymakers.

There are five seats reserved for Christians and one each for Fayli Kurds, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, and Shabaks. The Kurdish parliament reserves five seats for Turkmen, five for Christians, and one for Armenians. The political rights of minority groups have been severely impeded by widespread displacement from areas formerly occupied by the Islamic State (IS) militant group. The CoR and the Kurdish parliament reserve 25 percent and 30 percent of their seats for women, respectively, though such formal representation has had little obvious effect on state policies toward women, who are typically excluded from political debates and leadership positions.

Other key parties include Sinn Féin—a left-wing republican party that leads the opposition—the Labour Party, and the Green Party.",4,"Opposition parties generally do not encounter restrictions or harassment that affects their ability to gain power through elections, and most of the main parties have been part of government at some point in the history of the state.",4,"People’s political choices are generally free from domination by the military, foreign powers, religious hierarchies, and other powerful groups.",4,"Women are underrepresented, holding 23.1 percent of the Dáil’s seats. Women are visible in electoral politics, however, with Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats both having female leaders. Taoiseach Varadkar is gay and the son of an Indian immigrant.While ethnic minority and marginalized groups are generally free to participate in politics, Irish Travellers and Roma have little representation. Travellers were formally recognized as an Indigenous ethnic group in 2017, the same year a National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) was launched. A review of the NTRIS was due in 2021 but remained uncompleted at the end of 2022.",4
israel,"Israel hosts a diverse and competitive multiparty system. However, parties or candidates that deny Israel’s Jewish character, oppose democracy, or incite racism are prohibited. This has occasionally been invoked against both far-right Jewish candidates and Arab candidates. After agreeing to join the coalition government in December 2022, the far-right Religious Zionist party announced plans to pursue legal amendments that would remove the prohibition on “racial incitement” in the Knesset.",3,"Israel has undergone multiple, peaceful rotations of power among rival political groups during its history, and the 2022 elections resulted in the replacement of the incumbent prime minister. Opposition parties have typically controlled many local governments, and Arab-majority towns are mostly run by independents or mayors from the Joint List.",4,Israeli voters are generally free from coercion or undue influence by interest groups outside the political sphere. Political parties rely mostly on public subsidies for their financing.,4,"Political rights are unevenly upheld. Women generally enjoy full political rights in law and in practice, though they remain underrepresented in leadership positions and can encounter additional obstacles in parties and communities—both Jewish and Arab—that are associated with religious or cultural conservatism. Shas and United Torah Judaism continued to exclude women from their candidate lists in 2022, while Ra’am elected its first woman Knesset member in 2020. Political power in Israel is held disproportionately by Jewish men; while Ashkenazim (Jews of European descent) have historically enjoyed particular advantages, Mizrahim (Jews of Middle Eastern descent) have gained representation in recent decades.In 2018, the Knesset adopted a new “basic law” known as the nation-state law, which introduced the principle that the right to exercise self-determination in the State of Israel belongs uniquely to the Jewish people, among other discriminatory provisions. The basic laws of Israel are considered equivalent to a constitution, and critics of the nation-state law said it created a framework for the erosion of non-Jewish citizens’ political and civil rights, though any such effects have been limited to date. Arab citizens of Israel, who often identify as Palestinian, already faced some discrimination in practice, both legal and informal. Until 2021, no Arab party had ever been formally included in a governing coalition, and Arabs generally do not serve in senior positions in government. Members of other ethnic and religious minority populations, as well as LGBT+ Israelis, enjoy some representation in the Knesset and the political system more broadly.The roughly 670,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are Israeli citizens and can participate in Israeli elections. Arab residents of East Jerusalem have the option of obtaining Israeli citizenship, though most decline for political reasons. According to official government figures, those who have attempted to obtain citizenship face significant delays and are rejected in 66 percent of cases. While these noncitizens are entitled to vote in municipal as well as Palestinian Authority (PA) elections, most have traditionally boycotted Israeli municipal balloting, and Israel has restricted PA election activity in the city. A Palestinian Jerusalem resident who is not a citizen cannot become mayor under current Israeli law. Israeli law strips noncitizens of their Jerusalem residency if they are away for extended periods, and a law adopted in 2018 empowers the interior minister to revoke such residency for those deemed to be involved in terrorism or treason-related offenses. Citizenship and residency status are overwhelmingly denied to Palestinian residents of the West Bank or Gaza Strip who are married to Israeli citizens.Courts can revoke the citizenship of any Israeli convicted of spying, treason, or aiding the enemy. Separately, it was reported during 2017 that the Interior Ministry had revoked the citizenship of dozens and possibly thousands of Bedouins over several years, citing decades-old registration errors. Lawmakers have since raised questions about the legality of this ongoing practice.Jewish immigrants and their immediate families are granted Israeli citizenship and residence rights. It is extremely difficult in practice for non-Jewish immigrants to obtain citizenship.",2
italy,"Political parties are generally able to form and operate freely, and the political landscape features a high level of pluralism and competition. Since the beginning of the 1990s, politics have been characterized by unstable coalitions and the frequent emergence of new parties.Following violent protests against COVID-19 vaccinations that took place in October 2021, some parties called on the government to ban neofascist movements that participated in the protests, but it did not do so.",4,"Italy has a long record of frequent changes in the governing coalition, with multiple transfers of power since the early 1990s. In the 2022 elections, center-left and centrist parties, who were unable to form large coalitions on the order of the right-wing alliance, collectively won more votes than Meloni's bloc, but the electoral law awards a third of seats on a first-past-the-post system, which favors broad coalitions, thus granting a solid majority in both houses of parliament to the right.",4,"The public is generally free to make political choices without undue interference. However, organized crime groups retain some ability to intimidate and influence politicians, especially at the local level, and to establish corruption networks abetted by public administrators. In 2022, the government dissolved several town councils over ties to local mafia-like groups, and some cases of mafia-related vote-buying were discovered in 2022 local elections.",3,"Electoral laws contain provisions designed to encourage political participation by linguistic minorities, and to promote gender parity, though progress toward full political representation for women and LGBT+ people remains slow. Although Meloni is Italy’s first-ever female prime minister, women’s representation in parliament decreased following the 2022 elections, against the positive trend recorded in the past two decades. After the election, women made up 32 percent of the Chamber of Deputies and 34 percent of the Senate.During the 2022 vote, transgender and gender-nonconforming voters complained of discrimination at many polling stations, where voters were forced into gender-segregated queues to vote.The political participation rights accorded to migrants, and even to their descendants born in Italy, are extremely limited in national and local politics, a dynamic exacerbated by the emergence of a xenophobic and nationalist discourse in recent years and by the failure of citizenship reforms. In March 2022, a draft reform of the citizenship law to grant Italian citizenship to those born in Italy to foreign parents, those who entered Italy before the age of 12, and those who regularly attended school in the country, was adopted by the Chamber of Deputies but did not progress. According to survey data collected by the organization ActionAid, between 1.8 million and 2.5 million people are excluded from citizenship in Italy despite being born or raised there. European Union (EU) citizens are entitled to vote in local elections.",3

Women held 46 seats, or less than 10 percent of the total, in the lower house of the Diet as of 2022.About 600,000 ethnic Koreans born in Japan hold special residency privileges but not Japanese citizenship, meaning they are ineligible to participate in any elections at the national and local levels. Most but not all are South Korean nationals, and they have the option of applying for Japanese citizenship.The Ainu, an Indigenous people numbering at least 20,000, live mostly on the northern island of Hokkaido.

jordan,"Political parties based on ethnicity, race, gender, or religion are banned in Jordan. Parties must receive approval from the Ministry of Political and Parliamentary Affairs and the IEC. Authorities have reportedly intimidated individuals attempting to form political parties and there is a long-standing fear of creating or joining political parties due to the regime’s historically harsh repression of them.While the IAF has been tolerated, it suffers from the electoral system’s malapportionment, which weakens its urban support base. Its parent organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, was deregistered in 2015 and was closed in 2016. The government licensed its offshoot group, the Muslim Brotherhood Society (MBS), all of which exacerbated preexisting divisions and weakened it politically. In 2020, the organization lost an appeal against the transfer of its offices to the MBS, with the Court of Cassation ordering its dissolution. The IAF participated in the November 2020 polls despite the ruling.The electoral system favors tribally affiliated independents over political parties with specific ideologies and platforms, as does the patronage-based political culture. The al-Hayat Center reported that only 12 percent of candidates relied on party-lists to earn votes. New electoral law enacted in March 2022 transferred oversight of candidates’ partisan affiliations to the IEC, but it has been criticized for maintaining vague language that allows for arbitrary restrictions on the parties overall. Some party leaders and members are subject to harassment by officials including travel bans, summons by the security officials, and denials of legal document renewals.",2,"The political system—including the overrepresentation of rural voters—limits the ability of any party-based opposition to make significant gains. The IAF and its allies in the Islah Alliance, won a combined 8.7 percent of lower-house seats in the 2020 election. Moreover, the constitutional authority of the monarchy means that no opposition force can win control of the executive branch by democratic means alone.",1,"While voters and candidates are generally free from overt threats or violence, they remain heavily influenced by tribal affiliations and the state-sponsored patronage networks that accompany them. The Jordanian intelligence service is widely believed to influence the electoral process. Citizens’ political participation is also constrained by the fact that many important positions are appointed rather than elected.",1,"Women have equal political rights, and women candidates have seats beyond the legal quotas set for the parliament and subnational councils, but cultural prejudices remain an obstacle to their full participation in practice. No women won parliamentary seats beyond the 15-seat quota in the 2020 poll. Women won 27 percent of all municipal, governorate, and Amman municipality council seats in the 2022 local elections.Nine lower-house seats are reserved for Christians, and three are reserved for ethnic Circassians and Chechens together. Christians are not permitted to contest unreserved seats. Citizens of Palestinian origin, who tend to live in urban areas, make up most of the overall population but remain politically underrepresented.",2
kazakhstan,"June 2022 changes to the constitution reduced the number of members required to register a party with the Ministry of Justice from 20,000 to 5,000. Despite this, the registration process remains onerous, and officials have broad discretion to delay or deny party registration in practice. Several new parties being considered for registration are led by figures close to the Nazarbaev regime. The law still prohibits parties based on ethnic origin, religion, or gender. Opposition parties have been banned or marginalized through laws against extremism; their leaders have faced criminal charges, and their followers have had their activities restricted. The leader of the unregistered opposition Democratic Party of Kazakhstan, Janbolat Mamai, was arrested in the aftermath of the January 2022 violence on grounds of organizing mass riots. Mamai’s supporters and Human Rights Watch (HRW) claim the case against him is without merit and politically motivated.",1,"Kazakhstan experienced its first peaceful transfer of power in 2019 when Nazarbaev stood down as president, though he gave no reasoning for his decision and his preferred successor was elected in a poll that lacked credible opposition. Opposition parties are locked out of gaining power or influence through legislative elections. The ruling party Amanat holds a supermajority of seats in the Majilis, and the second- and third-largest parties in the body are considered loyal to Amanat. However, in an ostensible attempt to disengage the party from the executive, Toqaev stood down as the leader of Amanat in April 2022.The opposition Democratic Party remains unregistered and its leader Janbolat Mamai was released from prison but placed under house arrest in November 2022. Mamai’s wife, Inga Imanbai, was also fined and detained briefly for breaking the law on public gatherings.",0,"While voters and candidates are not subject to undue influence by the military, the political system is dominated by a small group of elites. The extent of the Russian government’s influence over politics in Kazakhstan is unknown, which is shaped largely by competition among elites for resources and positions.",1,"The legal ban on parties with an ethnic, religious, or gender focus—combined with the dominance of Amanat—limits the ability of women and minority groups to organize independently and advocate for their interests through the political system. Women currently hold 27 percent of the seats in the Majilis and less than 19 percent of the seats in the Senate. The Kazakh language test for presidential candidates also presents an obstacle for non-Kazakh ethnic minorities, as well as many Russian-speaking Kazakhs.",1
kenya,"Citizens are free to organize into political parties. Kenyan parties represent a range of ideological, regional, and ethnic interests, but are notoriously weak, and are often amalgamated into coalitions designed only to contest elections. Under the Political Parties Act (PPA), parties that receive at least 5 percent of the votes cast in a national election are eligible for public funds. In January 2022, then president Kenyatta signed into law amendments to the PPA that, among other things, allow for coalition parties, over Ruto’s strong objections. However, significant disadvantages to youth and women aspirants—including indirect candidate nomination processes—remain.Little has been done to bring to justice the perpetrators of political violence that took place in previous years. In September 2022, Paul Gicheru, a lawyer on trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of witness tampering following electoral violence in 2007–08, was found dead. The ICC case against Gicheru was officially closed in October. International rights groups have since called on the Kenyan authorities to “thoroughly and transparently” investigate Gicheru’s sudden death.",2,"Opposition parties and candidates are competitive in Kenyan elections. In the August 2022 elections, then deputy president Ruto, who portrayed himself as standing outside Kenya’s longstanding political dynasties, defeated five-time presidential candidate Odinga, who had been endorsed by incumbent president Kenyatta. The 2022 polls were highly competitive, and unlike the previous election, were not boycotted by opposition groups.",3,"While people’s political choices are somewhat free from undue influence by powerful, democratically unaccountable actors, groups such as Mungiki, a Kikuyu-affiliated gang, exert control over daily services such as matatu (minibus) routes in some regions, and may use violence, intimidation, and other extrapolitical means to influence local and national electoral outcomes.",2,"Ethnicity remains the most salient organizing principle in Kenyan politics, and two ethnic groups—the Kikuyu and Kalenjin—have dominated the presidency since independence. The 2010 constitution intended to reduce the role of ethnicity in elections, and fiscal and political devolution, implemented in 2013, has served to generate more intraethnic competition at the county level. Nevertheless, the politicization of ethnicity at the national level still hinders effective representation of different segments of Kenya’s diverse population, limits voter choice, and impedes meaningful policy debates. While ethnicity played a less prominent role in the 2022 presidential election—with Ruto’s campaign focused on economic issues, and voters in Kikuyu strongholds voting for the Kalenjin Ruto over the Kikuyu Kenyatta’s endorsed candidate, Odinga—longstanding political mistrust between the Kikuyu and the Luo ethnic group, to which Odinga belongs, may have contributed to his loss.The stipulation that all voters possess a National Identity Card hinders historically marginalized groups from obtaining greater access to the political process, particularly the nearly seven million pastoralists from the upper Rift Valley and North Eastern Province. There are significant implicit barriers to the participation of non-Christian and LGBT+ people in national politics. Somali Kenyans, especially in Nairobi’s Eastleigh community and in the coastal and northeastern parts of the country, have been the target of government crackdowns ostensibly combating the Shabaab militant group, and are underrepresented politically.",2

In the 2021 snap elections, Vetëvendosje won more than 50 percent of parliamentary seats and was able to form a government without relying on the support of the country’s old political guard.

All 10 parliamentary seats reserved for ethnic Serbs are filled by Serb List representatives.",4,"Corruption and clientelism continue to impact voters’ choices during elections, as does pressure from powerful business interests. Serbian authorities continue to exert influence on the platform of the Serb List, as well as the political choices of Kosovo’s ethnic Serbs generally. Major political figures in Kosovo have links to organized crime and high-level corruption, which play powerful roles in politics and have influenced the installation of key leaders. However, the 2021 election ushered in a major shift in Kosovo’s political landscape, relegating to opposition a number of key figures who were implicated in illicit activities.In December 2022, local elections were due to take place in the north of Kosovo, following the withdrawal of Serbian political and police personnel. However, they were postponed to April 2023 due to a fragile security situation.",3,"Members of ethnic, racial, and other groups are generally able to participate meaningfully in politics, though LGBT+ people remain notably marginalized.

Six of 18 cabinet members are women.Gender quotas are enshrined in the Constitution and more than 40 women were elected to the Assembly in the 2021 parliamentary elections, many of whom were elected without the quota. However, women have historically been underrepresented in politics.

Senior members of the ruling family allegedly provide economic resources to favored politicians and journalists to exert political influence.In the absence of political parties, major tribes hold their own informal and technically illegal primary elections to unite members behind certain parliamentary candidates, who then typically use their public office to generate economic benefits for members of their tribe. The government has worked to stop such coordination on the grounds that it is unfair, and more than two dozen people were arrested on charges of participating in tribal primaries ahead of the 2022 elections. Of the two who won seats while in detention, one was released on bail and the other had his two-year prison sentence confirmed in October.",2,"The electorate consists of men and women over age 21 who have been citizens for at least 20 years and have a Kuwaiti father. Most members of state security agencies are barred from voting.Access to citizenship is tightly restricted. About 70 percent of the country’s residents are noncitizens, primarily from South Asian or other Arab countries, who have no right to vote even if they are lifelong residents. Naturalization is extremely rare for people born abroad or without a Kuwaiti father, and it is not permitted for non-Muslims. Individuals have had their Kuwaiti citizenship revoked for political reasons.More than 100,000 residents, known as bidoon, are stateless; many bidoon claim Kuwaiti nationality and descent, but official processes to verify their eligibility for citizenship are slow, opaque, and largely ineffective. In November 2022, the speaker of the newly elected parliament proposed a bill to reform Kuwait’s nationality law and resolve the status of the bidoon.The Shiite Muslim community makes up about a third of the citizen population but is not well represented in the political system. Shiite candidates won nine seats in the 2022 elections, compared with six in the 2016 and 2020 polls.Women have had the right to vote and run for office since 2005, and some have been elected to the parliament. Two women won seats in 2022, up from zero in 2020, and two women were appointed as cabinet ministers in October. Entrenched societal attitudes hamper more active participation by women in the political process, although civil society groups like Mudhawi’s List have emerged in recent years to support women running for elected positions.

New legislation approved during the constitutional referendum in 2021 raised the national threshold to 5 percent; electoral amendments passed in 2020 had previously lowered the threshold from 7 percent to 3 percent.Political parties were impeded by violence in the aftermath of the October 2020 parliamentary elections. Opposition parties excluded from the parliament attempted to collaborate in the formation of a transitional government but Japarov supporters, acting with groups believed to maintain criminal connections, engaged in a campaign of street violence to intimidate supporters, with security forces failing to intervene.Throughout 2021, opposition candidates and activists were subjected to a mass targeted wiretapping campaign, which the Interior Ministry defended as a legitimate security measure. During the parliamentary campaign, Orozayim Narmotava, a member of Butun Kyrgyzstan, was arrested for her “excessive and unfair criticism” of the government, which the Interior Ministry claimed was designed to inflame protest that in turn could lead to a “violent seizure of power.” Narmatova was elected to the parliament, but the CEC canceled her mandate in January 2022, alleging that she had falsified her academic credentials.

Under the country’s power-sharing system, none of the parties they control consistently behave as opposition groups. Consolidation of power among political elites also hampers intraparty competition.Despite the new electoral system introduced in 2017, the political parties and alliances that prevailed before the reform have largely maintained their positions. They have not only benefited from advantages under laws they shaped, but also used intimidation, social pressure, and propaganda to marginalize new political forces.

The 2022 elections featured credible allegations of corruption, widespread vote buying, and analyses pointing to the role of establishment parties’ patronage networks in mobilizing or incentivizing voters. Independent candidates were reportedly harassed or physically threatened by supporters of the dominant political parties in their districts.",1,"Lebanon officially recognizes 18 religious communities, and the political system ensures that nearly all of these groups are represented, though not according to their actual shares of the population. Individuals who are not, or do not wish to be, affiliated with the recognized groups are effectively excluded.

Moreover, the country’s large refugee population, including residents of Palestinian refugee camps and Syrians who fled their country’s civil war, are not eligible to acquire citizenship and have no political rights.Women formally have the same political rights as men. In practice, women remain marginalized due to religious restrictions, institutionalized inequality, hidden legal obstacles, political culture, and societal discrimination. Neither the 2017 electoral law nor informal understandings regarding power-sharing include rules to guarantee women’s representation in politics. The 2022 elections continued a pattern of gradual increases in participation: 155 women registered as candidates, 118 ultimately ran, and eight were elected to serve in the parliament, up from six in 2018. Women candidates were far less likely than men to receive media coverage during the campaign, and they were reportedly more likely to be the targets of violent speech on social media.LGBT+ people have little political representation.

Over 50 registered parties contested the 2022 elections, compared to 27 during the 2017 elections.However, the IEC faces difficulties in regulating campaign funding and holding parties accountable for their use of public funds. The lack of restrictions on private campaign donations contributed to an uneven playing field during the 2022 elections.Political instability and associated violence and intimidation has at times prompted opposition leaders to flee the country. The South African Development Community’s (SADC) years-long governance reform recommendations were not implemented prior to the 2022 elections.",4,"Opposition parties have a realistic chance of gaining power through elections, and power has rotated frequently between DC- and ABC-led coalitions since 2012. The 2022 general elections continued the pattern of voters replacing incumbent governments. Formed in March 2022, the RFP overtook well-established parties that have controlled the country’s political landscape for the past decade. ",4,"Lesotho has a long history of political instability largely related to disputes among factions of the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) and the politicization of security agencies in general. Election observers found no reports of voter interference by security forces during the 2022 elections.Principal chiefs wield some political influence over their rural subjects. Some political parties, particularly the ABC and the DC, recruited members and used the music of famo music groups, implicated in deadly gang-related activities in both Lesotho and South Africa, during the 2022 elections, raising questions about the amount of influence they exert on elected officials.",2,"The constitution guarantees political rights for all. However, societal norms discourage women from running for office, despite the 2011 Electoral Act requires men and women to be listed alternately on parties’ candidate lists for the National Assembly. Women are often deprioritized on party lists. Only a quarter of parliamentarians elected in 2022 were women, and few women hold high-ranking positions.Persons living with disabilities are not fully represented in government, and accessibility concerns were not addressed during elections. Although the IEC implemented procedures to facilitate assisted voting during the 2022 elections, many polling stations were inaccessible to persons with disabilities. LGBT+ individuals face societal discrimination and generally do not advocate for their rights in the political sphere. The SADC preliminary election report commended the inclusion of young people as candidates by several political parties: the youngest candidate was 18 years old.",3
liberia,"Political parties generally do not face undue legal or practical obstacles that prevent them from forming or operating. The People’s Liberation Party was certified by the NEC in late December 2020 and opened a party office in Monrovia in February 2021. Opposition parties can form coalitions; the Collaborating Political Parties (CPP) coalition formed in 2019 was certified in August 2020, but broke apart in February 2022 after infighting between its four constituent members. In May 2022, several political parties came together to create a new political alliance called the Democratic Alliance of Liberia.",3,"Opposition parties and independent candidates have a realistic chance of gaining office and power through elections. In 2017, President Weah, of the then opposition CDC, defeated the former ruling party’s candidate. Opposition candidates found success in the December 2020 Senate elections, with only three CDC candidates winning across 15 races.",3,"Allegations of undue influence or pressure on voters by powerful groups are somewhat rare. However, a general wariness of election-related violence persists in Liberia.",3,"Lebanese people and people of Asian descent whose families have lived in Liberia for generations are denied citizenship and cannot participate in political processes. This provision was retained in Liberia’s new dual citizenship law, passed in July 2022, which granted Liberians the right to hold dual citizenship. Critics claimed that President Weah only passed the law because his son lives abroad and his wife is Jamaican, and that the consequences of the law would ramp up foreign investment at the expense of local people—citizenship is required to own land in the country. The amendments did not remove the law’s requirement that individuals have African ancestry in order to be citizens.Women are poorly represented in national politics and hold few leadership positions in political parties, though former president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (2006–18) was the first woman to be elected head of state in Africa, and Liberia’s current vice president and chief justice of the Supreme Court are women. Only 2 of the 30 senators are women, and women hold 8 of 73 seats in the House of Representatives. One amendment to the New Elections Law (1986) passed by the legislature in 2022 would create a 30 percent gender quota in the legislature. Social stigma against LGBT+ people discourages them from advocating for their rights.",3
libya,"A range of political parties organized to participate in the 2012 GNC elections, but all candidates were required to run as independents in the 2014 HoR elections. Civilian politics have since been overshadowed by the activities of armed groups, which wield significant power and influence on the ground. While various political factions and coalitions exist, the chaotic legal and security environment does not allow for normal political competition; political parties are largely built around personalities rather than coherent platforms, and often do not have substantial constituencies.",1,"Libya remained divided between rival political and military factions in 2022, with no clear plans for elections, and political influence was still heavily dependent on military strength.Before it was postponed, the presidential voting set for December 2021 had already been severely compromised by widespread voter intimidation and armed obstruction of the electoral process.Several of the leading presidential contenders had backgrounds that cast doubt on their viability as candidates. They included Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, a son of the former dictator who was wanted for extradition by the International Criminal Court; Haftar, the LAAF commander, who had also been implicated in violations of international law; and GNU prime minister Dbeibah, who had been accused of corruption and ran despite LPDF stipulations against GNU figures participating in the 2021 elections.",0,"Ordinary citizens have no role in Libya’s political affairs, which are currently dominated by armed factions, foreign governments, oil interests, smuggling syndicates, and other extrapolitical forces. Citizens and civilian political figures are subject to violence and intimidation by the various armed groups.",0,"Political impasses and armed conflicts have prevented all segments of the population from exercising their basic political rights. Women and communities that lack an affiliation with a powerful militia are especially marginalized.The CDA featured two reserved seats each for three non-Arab ethnic minority groups: Amazigh, Tebu, and Tuareg. The Amazigh, however, largely boycotted the 2014 CDA elections and had no representatives in the body, and the two Tebu members rejected the draft constitution it adopted in 2017. The draft was approved by the CDA despite rules requiring support from at least one member from each of the three minority groups. Amazigh, Tuareg, and Tebu organizations also denounced UN representatives for excluding their communities from the LPDF process. Members of all three groups are often unable to acquire citizenship or other forms of documentation, further contributing to their political disenfranchisement.",0
liechtenstein,"There are no onerous limits on the establishment or activities of political parties. The 8 percent vote threshold for representation in the parliament is comparatively high, though the 2013 elections marked the first time that four parties had won seats, and subsequent elections have also yielded representation for four parties. In 2019, an administrative court ruled that the new DpL should be recognized by the government as a political party, which entitled it to public financing.",4,"The unelected prince wields significant governmental authority, meaning the extent to which power can change hands through elections is limited. The FBP and VU have traditionally dominated the parliament, competing with each other and usually forming coalition governments. The FL has long served as an opposition party, and more recently, DU and its offshoot DpL have also acted as opposition forces in the legislature.",3,"Although citizens’ political choices are largely free from undue interference, the prince has the power to veto the outcome of national referendums and popular initiatives. He has occasionally threatened to use this power, thereby influencing the results. In a 2012 constitutional referendum, however, 76 percent of voters rejected a proposal to limit the prince’s veto power.Transparency of political financing remains a concern. In response to calls for reform by the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), the parliament in 2019 passed a modification of the law on party financing, stipulating that parties may no longer accept anonymous donations exceeding 300 Swiss francs ($325). However, the law did not require parties to publicly disclose their known donors, and campaign financing remains largely unregulated.",3,"Approximately one-third of the population consists of foreign nationals—mostly from neighboring countries—who do not have political rights in the principality. Under Liechtenstein’s restrictive naturalization criteria, one must live in the country for 30 years, or marry a resident Liechtenstein citizen and live in the country for more than 10 years, to qualify for citizenship.Women and members of ethnic minority groups generally enjoy formal political equality, though some disparities persist in practice. As part of a 2020 referendum, voters rejected a proposed change to the constitution that would have required the promotion of equal representation for women in politics. However, following the 2021 elections, the number of women in the parliament increased from three to seven.",3
lithuania,"Political parties generally operate freely. Citizens of other European Union (EU) member states living in the country are eligible to join and found Lithuanian political parties.The minimum number of members for political parties, which stands at 2,000, somewhat restricts the creation of new parties and the maintenance of small ones. Public funding rules generally favor the main parliamentary forces, as private financing of political organizations is tightly restricted. In September 2022, the Seimas overrode a presidential veto to significantly raise requirements for the formation and functioning of public election committees—a way for groups of citizens to run for municipal councils or the European Parliament without joining or establishing a political party. Consequently, the number of committees registered for forthcoming March 2023 local elections dropped almost threefold, to 32, from the 87 that had been registered for the previous local elections, in 2019.",4,"Regular transfers of power between rival parties after elections have been the norm since the early 1990s, with left- and right-leaning coalitions alternating in government. Parties in opposition retain a significant presence in the Seimas.",4,"Sporadic cases of vote buying during national elections have been observed, and clientelism can influence politics at the local level. However, voters and candidates are generally free to exercise their political autonomy without undue influence or interference.",4,"There are no formal restrictions on the political participation of women, LGBT+ people, or members of ethnic, religious, and other minority groups. Women and women’s interests remain underrepresented in politics, though improvements are evident. Women currently hold 28 percent of Seimas seats and the three leaders of the governing coalition are women, including Prime Minister Šimonytė and Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen, the leader of the Liberal Movement, who serves as Seimas speaker. Šimonytė’s cabinet approaches gender balance, with women holding 6 of the 14 ministerial posts. Political parties that are supportive of LGBT+ rights increased their parliamentary representation in 2020. The Freedom Party, founded in 2019, campaigned for marriage equality and had an openly gay candidate among its leaders.The Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania–Christian Families Alliance (LLRA-KŠS), which represents members of the ethnic Polish minority, won three seats in single-mandate districts.",4
luxembourg,"The political system is open to the establishment of new parties, which do not face undue obstacles in their formation or activities. Three parties have traditionally dominated politics: the CSV, historically aligned with the Roman Catholic Church; the LSAP, a center-left party; and the DP, which favors free-market economic policies. Four smaller parties—the Greens, the ADR, the Left, and the Pirate Party—have also won representation. While constituting a party is relatively easy, the structure and size of electoral constituencies favor larger parties.",4,"The country has a record of peaceful transfers of power between rival parties. Both the DP and the Greens were in the opposition before forming the governing coalition with the LSAP in 2013. The CSV, which had played a leading role in most governments since 1945, was forced into opposition in 2013 for the first time since 1979, and it remained out of government following the 2018 election.",4,"Citizens are generally able to make political choices without undue interference from any democratically unaccountable groups. However, close links between the country’s financial center and its law-making elites are regularly topics of concern for the opposition and outside observers.",4,"Women engage actively in politics, and the government has taken measures to encourage greater participation. A 2016 law mandates that at least 40 percent of each party’s electoral candidates be women; parties risk losing a portion of their public financing if they do not meet the quota. However, only 21 women hold seats in the Chamber of Deputies, making up 35 percent of the body. Citizens who belong to ethnic minorities and LGBT+ people enjoy full political rights and are free to participate in practice. In 2013, Bettel became the nation’s first openly gay prime minister. About 49 percent of the population consists of foreign nationals, most of whom are citizens of other EU member states, with Portugal accounting for the largest single contingent. The law allows naturalization and dual nationality, and children automatically gain citizenship when a parent is naturalized. Foreign residents are entitled to vote in municipal elections and EU foreigners can participate in EU elections. In September 2021, the government abolished a five-year residency requirement for voting in municipal elections; however, foreign residents are excluded from participating in national elections. Notably, politicians of foreign origin remain rare in Luxembourg, despite the background of nearly half the population.",4
madagascar,"Almost 200 political parties are registered in Madagascar. However, the law on political parties is widely viewed as a flawed document that places undue burdens on individual candidates, effectively instituting a high financial barrier for political candidacy. Political leaders frequently use religion, ethnicity, and caste as instruments to mobilize voters.In July 2022, several hundred people gathered in Antananarivo to protest a growing cost-of-living crisis. Organizers of the protest were largely affiliated with opposition parties and originally planned to hold the demonstrations inside property owned by the opposition leader Marc Ravalomanana. During the protests, police detained two leaders of TIM, Rina Randriamasinoro and Jean-Claude Rakotonirina, allegedly for “inciting hatred and public unrest.” In May, opposition leader Ravalomanana was stopped by the police on his way to attend a TIM meeting.In February 2022, Mahery Lanto Manandafy, a prominent opposition figure and son of the renowned leftist politician Manandafy Rakotonirina, was arrested and given a six-month suspended prison sentence for allegedly “spreading false information” on Facebook and “insulting an institution.” In his posts, Manandafy had criticized the construction of a bridge, claiming it was structurally flawed. He was again arrested in September on similar charges and for defamation; he remained detained at year-end.",3,"Opposition parties can increase their support through elections, but most political parties lack the financial resources to engage in vibrant competition. The government has historically denied opposition parties permits to hold demonstrations.An amendment to electoral law, passed by the National Assembly in 2019 and by the Senate in 2021, requires an elected official to hold official status as the parliamentary opposition leader. The TIM claimed the amendment targeted their party leader Ravalomanana, who had not assumed elected office.",3,"Economic networks compete for power through strategic support of political candidates. In turn, a narrow group of political elites maintain their status by supporting the interests of their private-sector patrons. As a result, lines between public and private expenditures are blurry.The military has some influence over politics, and it threatened to intervene during a 2018 political crisis. In July 2021, a few retired and active military officers were arrested for plotting to assassinate the president and overthrow the government. The two primary suspects were sentenced to 10 and 20 years of forced labor in December. Most of their accomplices were acquitted or received lesser sentences.",3,"The constitution guarantees political and electoral rights for all citizens, but in practice, discrimination impedes the political representation of some groups. The members of the Merina ethnic group are overrepresented in government institutions compared to the members of the other 17 official ethnic groups. While some LGBT+ people are active politically in the capital, they face social stigma that discourages political participation and open advocacy for their equal rights.Cultural norms restrict the political participation of women. Muslims, who are mostly of Pakistani and Indian descent, are disproportionately affected by the nationality code, which can make it difficult for them to secure citizenship documents and thus voting rights. Ethnicity and caste are important political determinants, but generally do not affect political rights.",2
malawi,"Several parties compete in elections, with the MCP, DPP, and UDF being Malawi’s largest. Parties are loosely organized, with politicians frequently moving between parties or forming their own breakaway groups.

malaysia,"The Malaysian party system is diverse and competitive, but factions in the opposition have faced unequal access to the media, restrictions on campaigning and freedom of assembly, and politicized prosecutions. The Registrar of Societies (ROS), which is overseen by the home minister, manages the registration of political parties and has issued partisan decisions under BN, PH, and PN governments. However, the relatively fluid political situation in recent years, with no bloc firmly in control, has allowed the emergence of new parties and stoked greater competition overall. A record number of candidates participated in the 2022 general elections, and many constituencies had multiple viable candidates instead of one-on-one contests.",3,"Although opposition parties have long governed in a number of Malaysia’s states, the 2018 elections that brought the PH to power represented the country’s first democratic transfer of power between rival political groups at the federal level since independence.In 2020, coalition realignments led to the formation of the PN, while the PH returned to opposition status. In August 2021, the PN’s prime minister, Muhyiddin, resigned after losing his parliamentary majority. The PH came close to returning to power, but Ismail Sabri of the BN succeeded Muhyiddin with a majority that largely resembled the previous one.The PH maintained significant influence despite its opposition status for much of 2022, owing to the Ismail Sabri government’s slim majority. The PH’s victory in the general elections reinforced the system’s openness to rotations of power, though it remained unclear whether the new coalition government would survive a full term in office.",3,"The military is not active in politics, and foreign states do not directly meddle in domestic political affairs. However, the BN maintained close ties with China while it was in power.During its decades in government, the BN also built strong connections with Malaysia’s business elites and used these relationships to influence electoral outcomes. The PN government similarly used state-linked companies, official monopolies for certain goods and services, and state investment vehicles for political purposes.",2,"Suffrage is universal for adult citizens, but social and legal restrictions limit political participation among some minority groups. Parties including UMNO and the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) are defenders of long-standing policies that favor the ethnic Malay and Muslim majority. The Malaysian Chinese Association has attracted support from among the ethnic Chinese community—which makes up 21 percent of the country’s population—and has traditionally supported the BN, though other, multiethnic parties compete for support from this group. Ethnic Indians account for 6 percent of the population and also have a presence in Parliament through various parties. The PN features minimal representation of and participation by Chinese and Indian Malaysians but does include representatives of ethnic groups from the states of Sabah and Sarawak, which are located on the island of Borneo. Representation for the country’s Indigenous groups remains poor.Women continued to be underrepresented in politics in 2022, accounting for less than 18 percent of the new cabinet and 14 percent of the lower house of Parliament. Harsh discrimination and criminal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations make it extremely difficult for LGBT+ Malaysians to publicly advocate for their political interests.",2

Opposition leaders and their supporters faced harassment including raids on opposition offices and arbitrary detentions and convictions, as well as restrictions on political rallies. The environment for political parties has improved under the new administration.Several new parties have recently emerged. The Maldives Reform Movement (MRM), led by former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, officially registered as a political party in November 2019. In July 2021, a new political party, the Maldives National Party, was registered and currently holds three seats in parliament. In May 2019, Mohamed Nasheed, the former president and current speaker of parliament, survived an assassination attempt in Malé. Authorities arrested 10 suspects and charged 4 with terrorism. One defendant, who pleaded guilty, was convicted in December 2022.",3,"While the political landscape had featured some undemocratic activity, including improper meddling by the judiciary and other forms of pressure, opposition parties and candidates have been able to gain power through elections.

The 2021 local council elections saw the PPM secure 34.9 percent of seats—finishing second but breaking the MDP’s supermajority.",2,"The Yameen government exerted improper influence over several state institutions and the Elections Commission to restrict the political choices of voters and politicians, including through politicized arrests and threats to public and private sector employees. While such abuses have waned under President Solih, intimidation by hardline Islamist groups continues to sporadically disrupt the political system and the rule of law. Vote buying remains a problem during elections, and allegations of bribery and corruption have surrounded instances of party switching in recent years.",2,"The constitution and laws in the Maldives require all citizens to be Muslims and all candidates for elected office to follow Sunni Islam, effectively excluding followers of minority religions. High-level positions in state institutions and independent bodies, including the Human Rights Commission, also require individuals to be Sunni Muslims.

mali,"The creation and functioning of political parties are governed by a legal framework known as the Political Parties Charter, which is generally fair. The charter prohibits the creation of political parties on an “ethnic, religious, linguistic, regionalist, sexist, or professional basis.” There are more than 100 registered political parties in Mali, though fewer than 20 are active. Parties are usually built around a particular personality, and policy differences between them are not always clear. Moreover, parties are often poorly funded, which hampers their ability to effectively organize and win voter support.",2,"Electoral competition is normally open to opposition forces. A 2014 law institutionalized specific privileges for opposition parties in the parliament, such as the ability to choose an official leader of the opposition. However, in 2016 the ruling majority adopted amendments to the electoral code that favored establishment and majority parties by requiring presidential candidates to make a significant financial deposit and receive support from a certain number of incumbent elected officials. Opposition figures faced violent attacks during parliamentary elections in 2020.In July 2022, the Supreme Court issued arrest warrants for former prime minister Boubou Cissé and several other former officials; regime critics have expressed concern that the warrants represent a possible attempt to prevent the Keïta-era officials from contesting the 2024 presidential election.",1,"Before the August 2020 coup d’état, citizens’ political choices were relatively free, though they were occasionally influenced by the promise of patronage appointments or other benefits in exchange for political support. The military junta that first took power in 2020 and consolidated its authority in the May 2021 coup has since appointed key officials and set election timetables without meaningful public consultation. Nevertheless, there have been some opportunities for civil society and political parties to participate in consultative processes, including ahead of the June 2022 electoral law changes.",0,"No law limits political rights for members of minority groups, and no single ethnic group dominates the government or security forces. Tuareg pastoralist groups in the north have historically occupied a marginal position in national political life.Societal attitudes can discourage women from participating in political processes.

The European Commission, the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) at the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Malta Chamber of Commerce, and the commissioner for standards in public life have all highlighted loopholes in a 2015 Financing of Political Parties Act, whose high thresholds for public disclosure do not ensure a sufficient level of transparency in the funding of political activities by parties and individual candidates.After the March 2022 elections, the third-ranked Democratic Alternative and Democratic Party (ADPD) alliance filed a constitutional challenge, arguing that its national vote tally should have earned it a seat in Parliament even if it fell short in each of the 13 five-seat districts. The group also asserted that it should have access to additional seats under a new system designed to ensure greater representation for women; the gender adjustments only apply if just two parties win ordinary seats, meaning third parties cannot benefit.",3,"The LP and PN have regularly alternated in government since independence in 1964, establishing a strong pattern of peaceful democratic transfers of power.",4,"Voters are free from undue interference in their political choices. However, powerful economic interests influence the main political parties.

Hilda Heine was the country’s first woman president. Only two women entered the 33-member Nitijela in 2019—Heine and newly elected Kitlang Kabua.In 2019, the Supreme Court removed a 2016 law that banned absentee voting. However, that law’s undoing did not take effect by the November 2019 elections, as the court recognized there was too little time for the government to implement the changes.

Opposition leaders may face repression for criticizing government policies.",1,"The political choices of Mauritanians are greatly influenced by the military. Mauritania has either been under military rule or led by a military leader with little interruption since 1978, though elections in the late 2010s were generally considered credible and the military’s overt involvement in politics has recently lessened. President Ould Ghazouani is a former defense minister and general, though he was elected in a competitive and democratic poll. The influence of religious leaders has grown stronger as the military’s has declined.",1,"The Bidhan ethnic group dominates government. Black Mauritanians and the Haratin ethnic groups are underrepresented in elected positions and in high-level government posts. Discrimination hinders the ability of these groups to gain power. Thousands of Black Mauritanians who were forced out of their villages by the military in 1989 have been allowed to return, but face difficulties when trying to enroll in the census and register to vote. Civil society activists have denounced the increasing importance of tribal affiliation in government appointments.Women participate in politics at lower levels than men, largely due to cultural norms, and women’s interests are poorly represented in national politics.

As a result, the MSM maintained power in local government without a mandate. The postponement led to protests and criticism from across the political spectrum.As of 2022, opposition leadership has struggled to create a broadly supported platform or present a political alternative to the MSM, leading to concerns about the capacity of the opposition to organize ahead of the 2024 elections. According to Afrobarometer, neither the ruling MSM nor opposition parties are trusted by a majority of the population.",3,"Voters and candidates are generally able to express their political choices without pressure from actors external to the political sphere.

Opposition parties are competitive in many states, and independent candidacies are becoming more common, though independents achieved few wins in 2021. MORENA includes a wide range of ideological and political currents, and internal tensions were visible during the 2021 campaign. Most opposition parties, meanwhile, base their strategies around mobilizing anti–MORENA sentiment rather than proposing coherent policy agendas.MORENA candidates won in 11 of the 15 gubernatorial races held in 2021, cementing the party’s strength at the subnational level. However, opposition candidates demonstrated strength in many urban areas and won a majority of Mexico City’s boroughs, reversing previous MORENA dominance in the city.",4,"Power has routinely changed hands at the national level since 2000. The dominant victory of López Obrador and MORENA in 2018 followed six years of government control by the PRI, which had ruled Mexico without interruption from 1929 to 2000, before losing consecutive presidential races to the right-leaning PAN in 2000 and 2006. In order to avoid fragmenting the anti–MORENA vote in the 2021 elections, the PAN, PRI, and PRD united in an electoral coalition, resulting in increased seat share, though the PRI’s precipitous decline at all levels continued. The opposition also made gains in large cities and among middle-class voters, revealing possible shifts in the electorate that could increase competitiveness in subsequent elections.",4,"Criminal groups, while increasingly fragmented, exert powerful influence on the country’s politics through threats and violence against candidates, election officials, and campaign workers, particularly at the local level. At least 102 political officials were killed in campaign-related violence during the 2021 election season. Significant levels of political violence were also recorded in 2022.  The López Obrador administration has assigned an increasing number of governance tasks to the military, one of Mexico’s least accountable institutions. The army is involved in the construction of several of the president’s signature projects, and in 2021 the government announced that the army would maintain control of a tourist railroad in the Yucatán Peninsula known as the Maya Train—and receive any profits—upon the project’s completion, heightening concerns about military politicization.In September 2022, Congress approved reforms transferring control of the National Guard—nominally a civilian-led force—to the Ministry of Defense, removing civilian control of the force despite the fact that it was legally required to undergo a process of civilianization. Rights groups and opposition legislators criticized the reforms, expressing concern that the changes gave too much power to the armed forces. A constitutional challenge of the reform brought before the SCJN remained awaiting a ruling as of year’s end.",2,"Mexico has a large Indigenous population, and Indigenous people and groups are free to participate in politics. There are some provisions for the integration of Indigenous community customs in electing leaders in some states, though only for local authorities. In practice, Indigenous people remain severely underrepresented in political institutions. Mexico’s small Afro-Mexican population is similarly underrepresented in national politics, though they are recognized in the constitution.The 2018 and 2021 elections confirmed the success of gender requirements for candidacies and party lists: following the 2021 elections, 50 percent of representatives in the Chamber of Deputies and 49 percent in the Senate are women. Women also won an unprecedented six gubernatorial elections in 2021.",3

However, neither these nor donor countries like the United States and China exert undue control over the political choices of voters or candidates. Investments from the United States and China have been met with pushback in recent years, as citizens are concerned about how those funds might impinge upon the FSM’s political, economic, and cultural independence.",4,"Women and minority groups formally have full political rights, and they are free to participate in practice, though women’s political engagement is limited to some extent by discriminatory attitudes. In December 2021, Dr. Perpetua Sappa Konman became the first woman to be sworn in to FSM’s national legislature after winning a by-election that November for her late husband’s single-member seat. A small number of women were elected to state-level legislatures.",3
moldova,"Political party legislation in Moldova is generally liberal but does include restrictions.Under the Law on Political Parties, which was amended in 2020, parties seeking registration must enlist 1,000 members. The law had required parties to enlist 4,000 members from at least half of all districts, but the Supreme Court ruled that obligation unconstitutional in 2020, prompting its revision. Following the adoption of these amendments, 20 political parties, two electoral blocs, and one independent candidate ran in the July 2021 parliamentary elections, representing a significant increase in participating parties compared with the previous elections.However, the amended party-registration restrictions still disproportionately affect regional, municipal, and local parties, as well as parties representing geographically concentrated ethnolinguistic minority populations (for example, Gagauzians and Bulgarians).",3,"Opposition parties have a strong presence in Parliament and other elected offices and can gain support through elections. Following the July 2021 parliamentary elections, the then opposition PAS formed a parliamentary majority, relegating the previously governing PSRM to opposition status.",4,"Politically powerful business magnates—known as oligarchs—and foreign actors strongly influence Moldovan politics at the national and local levels, undermining accountability to voters. The Russian regime in particular has been accused of influencing Moldovan affairs through the oligarchs Vladimir Plahotniuc and Ilan Șor.",2,"Women and members of ethnic, religious, and other minority groups do not face direct legal barriers to political participation, though representation of women, people with disabilities, and members of the Romany minority has historically been low. Several members of Moldova’s ethnic minorities, including Gagauzians, Bulgarians, and Roma, hold parliamentary seats, and women’s representation in Parliament and in high-level government positions has significantly increased in recent years.The current president and prime minister are both women.

monaco,"Political associations, groupings of people who hold similar political viewpoints, compete in Monaco, rather than traditional parties. There are no undue restrictions on the formation of new political associations. However, office seekers are prohibited from running as individual independent candidates; independents must instead form a list of at least 13 candidates to participate in elections.",3,"Opposition political associations are able to gain seats in the parliament. In 2018, Priorité Monaco, also known as Primo!, won 21 seats, while Horizon Monaco fell from 20 seats to 2. However, there are structural limits on the ability of political groupings to secure executive power through elections, as the cabinet—appointed by the prince—is not responsible to the elected parliament.",2,"The fact that the head of government is a French national appointed from a list submitted by Paris, and that the powerful head of state is an unelected monarch, means that people’s political participation is heavily circumscribed by democratically unaccountable forces. Nevertheless, voters’ and candidates’ choices with respect to parliamentary representation are largely free from domination by such entities.",2,"Only about 9,000 of Monaco’s residents—roughly a quarter of the total—are citizens, and noncitizens do not have the right to vote or run for office, though a number of legal routes to naturalization are available. Most noncitizen residents are nationals of neighboring France or Italy.Among the citizen population, women and members of racial or ethnic minority groups are free to participate in elections, both as voters and candidates, but women’s interests are not always well represented in the political system, and only eight women were elected to the parliament in 2018. The six-member council of ministers included two women as of January 2022.",3
mongolia,"While the Mongolian political system features multiple parties, it has also been marked by the dominance of the MPP and DP in the past. Parties are built around clientelist patronage networks rather than policy platforms. Representatives of large business groups play an important role in funding and directing the MPP and DP. HUN is represented in parliament with a single seat.",4,"There are no undue barriers preventing opposition parties from gaining power through elections, though there are practical hurdles. The rise of HUN illustrates that there is room for a new political party to gain support. However, many Mongolians perceive the party system to be closed by the need to raise financial capital to participate in elections.The opposition Democratic Party (DP) remains in disarray as its yearslong internal conflict between factions associated with erstwhile party chair Sodnomzundui Erdene and with former president Khaltmaa Battulga.",4,"Powerful business interests have some influence over candidates and have supported them through a nontransparent party-finance system. Proposals for a new party finance system have been brought forward for several years but have met resistance in Parliament. However, candidates and voters are generally free to make political choices without excessive outside influence, in part because corporate interests are balanced across various factions of the two main parties and among lawmakers.",4,"All adult citizens other than those who are incarcerated are entitled to full political rights, and these are generally observed in practice. However, despite quotas supporting gender diversity, women remain underrepresented in politics, holding about 17 percent of parliamentary seats and few senior government posts.

montenegro,"Political parties are for the most part able to form and operate without direct interference.Unlike the DPS regime, recent governments generally refrained from intimidating and delegitimizing opposition activity by equating it with threats to the state or to public order—though there have been occasional such accusations against various parties from both Đukanović and Abazović. Because of this calmer political environment, new opposition political groups are able to emerge, compete in local elections, and participate in the public sphere without being smeared as “enemies of the state.”",3,"Prior to the 2020 elections the DPS had been in power since 1991, which has provided it with significant structural advantages over opposition parties. In 2020, the opposition gathered in three coalitions to focus efforts on criticizing the DPS, which proved to be a winning strategy. While the DPS showed significant strength in local election in Nikšić in 2021, losing the capital of Podgorica in 2022 reflected declining popular support.Despite losing the Podgorica election, the DPS mayor remained in his post at year’s end. He had admitted defeat in October, but pointed as justification for remaining to election-related appeals the Constitutional Court could not decide because it lacked a quorum.",3,"While voters are generally free to express their political choices, the DPS has fostered extensive patronage networks in both public companies and private companies with links to the state, which encourage loyalty to the DPS. Many members of the DPS are believed to have ties to organized crime, which continues to provide opportunities for illicit pressure on voters and candidates. Neither the Krivokapić nor Abazović governments put a stop to the practice of clientelism, undermining the planned depoliticization and professionalization of public administration and the creation of a proclaimed meritocratic system. The Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC) in Montenegro remains to be a powerful political actor. Its influence was reflected in the abrupt signing in August 2022 by Prime Minister Abazović and the SPC Patriarch of the fundamental agreement governing the church’s legality in Montenegro. Abazović’s decision to sign the agreement—which deals with issues including real estate, and had been criticized by rights groups and others for offering the church greater power than other religious communities—triggered the collapse of his government.",2,"All citizens have full political rights and electoral opportunities. Small political parties representing interests of ethnic, religious, and other minority groups participate in the political sphere, and members of these minorities are also represented within larger parties—though the Romany population remains underrepresented. In the 2020 elections, voter materials were provided in the Albanian language, but not the Romany language.Women are underrepresented in political leadership positions and politics generally. Though the government formed in 2020 took steps to increase women’s participation, including through gender quotas on electoral lists, implementation remains uneven.",3
morocco,"Morocco has a multiparty system in which new parties frequently emerge, but are generally unable to assert themselves relative to the power of the palace. There remains significant cynicism toward electoral politics—a combination of distrust of party leadership, which is generally seen as corrupt and co-opted, and a belief that the palace ultimately makes major decisions.Justice and Charity (Al-Adl wa al-Ihsan) is an illegal Islamist movement that does not participate in elections. Nevertheless, it enjoys widespread support, and authorities largely tolerate its activities. The reformist February 20 Movement, which emerged from the 2011 Arab Spring protests, and Hirak Rif, a campaign that began in Morocco’s largely Amazigh (Berber) Rif region in 2016, enjoy considerable popular support, but both movements also face severe government repression.",2,"Although there was a significant change in the government with the September 2021 election—with the PJD replaced by a new coalition led by the RNI, Istiqlal, and PAM—the shift does not presage a significant change in policy or power. The cabinet, announced by the king following the election, maintains fundamental continuity, with technocratic, unaffiliated ministers appointed to strategic ministries.",1,"The constitution and informal practice give the king overwhelming influence over political affairs, including government formation. The monarch and his circle of advisers and associates—known in Morocco as the Makhzen (“central storehouse”)—wield enormous private political and economic power that can be used to shape political outcomes through patronage networks.",1,"The political system features universal suffrage, but parties based on religious, ethnic, or regional identity are prohibited, and the concerns and interests of women and the Amazigh population are not adequately addressed.At least 40 percent of the population is Amazigh; the majority of Moroccans have Amazigh roots. Amazigh elites enjoy access to the monarchy and have their interests represented in Parliament, but the bulk of the Amazigh population is socially, economically, and politically marginalized. Recent unrest in Al Hoceïma, the surrounding Rif region, and other cities across Morocco stemmed in large part from inequities experienced by many Amazigh residents and their inability to obtain redress for their grievances through the political system. A system of reserved seats for women is meant to encourage their participation in the electoral process at the national and local levels, partly offsetting traditional social pressures that deter such engagement. Electoral laws passed in 2021 helped facilitate an increase in women candidates for that year’s local and municipal elections: 27 percent of candidates were women, compared to 12 percent in 2015. Despite this, women lead only 1 percent of districts. In national elections, 60 of the 395 seats in the Chamber of Representatives are reserved for women; additionally, half of the 30 seats reserved for youth are to be filled by women. The cabinet formed in October 2021 included a record seven women.",1
mozambique,"The right to form political parties is largely respected. While many parties compete, most lack resources to campaign effectively and build a public following. Opposition leaders face harassment and threats for speaking out against the government. Figures within FRELIMO perceived as acting in conflict with the aims of the party can encounter obstacles, including intraparty disciplinary measures.",2,"FRELIMO first took power when Mozambique gained independence in 1975 and has maintained it since the 1992 agreement that ended the country’s civil war and the 1994 multiparty elections. Since then, FRELIMO has maintained an electoral advantage by using public resources to fund campaign activities.In 2018, the parliament overwhelmingly approved constitutional reforms that would allow the indirect election of provincial governors, district administrators, and mayors. The changes were viewed as beneficial to RENAMO and a step toward greater decentralization and political stability. However, because FRELIMO secured an overwhelming victory in the severely flawed 2019 elections, ostensibly winning the most votes in all provinces, it selected all the country’s provincial governors, effectively nullifying the constitutional reforms.",1,"Unelected elites in FRELIMO, including military figures and powerful businesspeople, retain great influence and play a large role in shaping the party’s platform. Civil servants face acute pressure to campaign and vote for the ruling party, and to make financial contributions to it. Those who openly support opposition candidates face intimidation by elements of the party embedded in state administration and the police.",2,"Ethnic minorities are generally able to participate fully in political life, and people from various ethnic groups hold high-level government positions. However, FRELIMO’s support base lies in the extreme north and extreme south, and ethnic groups concentrated in other regions, such as the Ndau and Macua, are underrepresented. In 2019, three districts affected by the regional conflict in Cabo Delgado Province could not vote for security reasons. Many ethnic-minority voters who live there, notably members of the Makonde and Mwani ethnic groups that are concentrated in the region, were effectively disenfranchised. Women hold 43 percent of seats in the parliament. In March 2022, Mozambique achieved gender parity at the cabinet level, becoming one of only 14 countries in which women hold at least 50 percent of ministerial posts. Nevertheless, men continue to hold most key political positions.",2
myanmar,"Party competition in the lead-up to the 2020 elections was robust, with 7,000 candidates from more than 90 parties participating, including the NLD, the USDP, and regionally based ethnic parties. Political parties continued to function after the February 2021 coup, though prominent political leaders have been arrested by the military regime, and some have been charged with and convicted of spurious criminal offenses. The constitution contains a requirement that political parties be loyal to the state, which carries the potential for abuse. Laws allow penalties, including deregistration, for political parties that accept support from foreign governments or religious bodies, or that are deemed to have abused religion for political purposes or disrespected the constitution.",1,"The military’s constitutional prerogatives, as well as its close ties to the USDP, limit the degree to which any other force can secure control over the executive or the legislature through elections. The military may have decided to stage a coup in February 2021 because the NLD won a convincing majority in the November 2020 elections.Min Aung Hlaing’s August 2022 announced that elections would be delayed beyond the originally planned August 2023 dates until the country is “peaceful,” a condition critics say is designed to stall any transfer of power back to civilian rule. However, the NUG and its ethnic allies, despite most of their being in exile or hiding, continued to gain strength as an alternative power base.",1,"The people’s choice in the November 2020 elections—the NLD—was not honored by the military, which refused to accept the election results, and seized control of the government in February 2021. Since the coup, the junta has consistently used harsh tactics to contain the widespread and ongoing protests against military rule and secure its takeover—including the arrest and sentencing of political leaders and civilian protestors, excessive violence and mass killings, and custodial abuse. In July 2022, the NLD’s Human Rights Record Group estimated that nearly 50 NLD members (including 3 former legislators) had been killed, and more than 900 NLD lawmakers had been arrested, of whom 109 remained in custody at the end of 2022.",0,"Members of Myanmar’s Buddhist and ethnic Bamar majority hold most senior leadership positions in the country, including in major national political parties, the pre-2021 civilian government, and the military. Members of ethnic and religious minority groups face restrictions on their political rights and electoral opportunities, including through discriminatory citizenship, residency, and party registration laws.The 1982 Citizenship Law does not allow for anyone who entered the country or is descended from someone who entered the country after 1948 to become a full citizen with political rights. Naturalization of spouses is only allowed if the spouse holds a Foreigner’s Registration Certificate from before the law’s enactment. The majority of the mainly Muslim Rohingya were rendered stateless by the 1982 Citizenship Law, which also dictates that only those who are descended from ethnic groups deemed to be native to the country prior to 1823 are considered full citizens. A 2015 presidential decree revoked the temporary identification cards that had allowed Rohingya to vote, and most of the 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar were unable to vote in the 2020 elections. Women remain underrepresented in the government and civil service, due largely to societal biases that discourage their political participation. Notwithstanding the prominence of Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father led Myanmar’s independence struggle, few women have achieved ministerial-level appointments.The NUG and the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a group of elected officials unseated by the military regime that claims to represent a legitimate parliament and perform the duties of an elected government, have made a concerted effort to include members of Myanmar’s various ethnic groups in their leadership structures and to address the goals and demands of these constituencies. They have also formed alliances with many of the country’s ethnic armed groups in opposition to military rule.",1

niger,"By law, political parties may freely organize and conduct their activities. However, the PNDS–Tarayya-led government has employed a variety of tactics to interfere in the operation of opposition parties, including persecution of opposition leaders and the co-option of key opposition figures. Over 150 political parties were registered as of November 2020. The majority has continued to co-opt opposition leaders, further contributing to the weakening of the opposition. In April 2022, a major opposition party, the Nigerien Patriotic Movement (MPN)–Kishin Kassa, joined the majority after its leader, Ibrahim Yacoubou, was nominated minister of energy and renewable energies. With the main opposition leader—Hama Amadou—in exile, and Yacoubou joining the majority, there is little effective opposition present in the Nigerien political landscape.",2,"Opposition parties have been divided into several coalitions and face serious difficulties in challenging the PNDS–Tarayya’s dominance. In addition, a history of government-led repression and co-option has hindered their ability to gain power through elections. A lack of leadership—partly due to the absence of Amadou, who previously served a prison sentence and is currently living in exile—has also contributed to a weak opposition in Niger.Members of the opposition have expressed concern over the rising insecurity in several regions, particularly in the opposition stronghold of Tillabéri, which has hindered parties’ ability to campaign and disturbed polling operations.

At the end of 2022, ahead of the 2023 general elections, 18 political parties were registered with the INEC.A constitutional amendment signed by President Buhari in 2018 allowed independent candidates to compete in federal and state elections. Buhari also signed a “Not Too Young to Run” bill that same month, lowering the age of eligibility to run for political office from 40 to 35 years. However, a lack of internal party democracy and high fees make it difficult for prospective candidates to vie for major-party nominations.",3,"Nigeria’s multiparty system provides an opportunity for opposition parties to gain power through elections, as demonstrated by Buhari’s 2015 victory over predecessor Goodluck Jonathan. Buhari’s election marked the first time in Nigerian history that a sitting president was peacefully replaced. Opposition parties can also gain influence when legislators cross the aisle; the APC lost its legislative majority when some of its legislators defected to the PDP during the 2015–19 term.New political parties have successfully entered the National Assembly in recent years; the YPP won its first Senate seat in 2019. The APGA, which was formed in 2003, won 10 lower-house seats in 2019. However, the APC and PDP still hold most elected offices in Nigeria.",3,"Citizens’ political choices remain impaired or undermined by vote buying and intimidation, the influence of powerful domestic and international economic interests, and the local domination of either the military or armed groups in some regions. Wealthy political sponsors, or “godfathers,” dispense patronage and use their considerable influence to cultivate support for candidates who then use their offices to enrich their backers. Governorship elections held in Ekiti and Osun states in June and July 2022, respectively, saw voter inducements and pockets of violence. Local elections held in 2021 were seriously affected by the presence and activities of armed groups. Several INEC offices were attacked by unidentified assailants that year, and campaigns in Anambra State were restricted during the electoral period, as candidates faced harassment from armed individuals.Residents of Anambra State and other areas were intimidated by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which called on southeasterners to abide by stay-at-home orders after the June 2021 arrest of its leader. Residents reportedly complied with these instructions for fear of violence. In October 2021, it called on residents of Anambra and several other states to remain home before rescinding that call days ahead of the Anambra contest. Turnout in Anambra State stood at 10.2 percent, the lowest recorded there since the transition to democratic rule.",1,"Nigeria’s legal framework generally provides for equal participation in political life by the country’s various cultural, religious, and ethnic groups. However, politicians and parties often rely on voters’ ethnic loyalties, and the interests of a given group may be poorly addressed in areas where it forms a minority or when affiliated parties are not in power.Women enjoy formal political equality, but restrictive societal norms limit their participation in practice. Only 8 women hold Senate seats, while 13 hold seats in the House of Representatives. Women are poorly represented in the cabinet; Buhari named 7 women to his 43-seat cabinet in July 2019.Same-sex relationships were criminalized and LGBT+ advocacy groups were banned in 2014, when former president Jonathan signed the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act. Openly LGBT+ people are deterred from running for office or working to advance their political interests.",2

The small number of minor groups that legally exist are all are members of the DFRF.,0,"Political dissent and opposition are prohibited and harshly punished. The country has been ruled by the KWP, which the Kim family has always controlled, since its founding. Kim Jong-un was promoted from KWP chairman to secretary general in 2021. His late father, Kim Jong-il, was dubbed the KWP’s “eternal general secretary” after his death.",0,"There is no opportunity for public political participation, and even KWP elites operate under the threat of extreme penalties for perceived dissent or disloyalty. The party is subject to regular purges aimed at reinforcing Kim Jong-un’s personal authority. The regime has executed senior officials who have fallen out of favor.",0,"North Korea is ethnically homogeneous, with only a small Chinese population and a few non-Chinese foreign residents. With few exceptions, foreigners cannot join the KWP or serve in the military or government. Religious groups are harshly suppressed and unable to organize politically. Women hold few leadership positions in ruling bodies and occupy only 121 of the SPA’s 687 seats; the system does not allow these representatives to independently address the interests of women. The government typically denies the existence of LGBT+ people in North Korea.",0
north-macedonia,"The constitution protects the right to establish and join political parties, though patronage networks hamper democratic competition. The main center-left and center-right blocs lost votes in the 2020 parliamentary elections to ethnic Albanian minority parties and Levica (Left) party, which won two seats and entered the Assembly for the first time. Independent candidates face obstacles including requirements to collect a relatively high number of signatures for eligibility to run in some races. They are also struggle to gain media coverage and are disadvantaged under rules governing the distribution of state funds for paid advertising. (In North Macedonia, paid campaign advertising in broadcast, print, and online media is exclusively funded by state budgets, a system the OSCE more generally notes has prompted concerns about clientelism.) Independent candidates are prohibited from running for the position of local councilor.",4,"In 2017, power rotated from the right-wing nationalist party, the VMRO–DPMNE—which had governed since 2006—to the left-leaning SDSM, which had governed through much of the 1990s and early 2000s. Before taking power in 2017, the SDSM had boycotted the parliament on several occasions over electoral-fraud claims and allegations that former prime minister Nikola Gruevski had directed a vast wiretapping and surveillance program. Elections since then have featured robust competition.Opposition gains characterized the October 2021 local elections. The opposition VMRO–DPMNE won 42 mayoral races, while the incumbent SDSM won only 16 mayoral spots. Tetovo, a majority-Albanian city, saw a power shift after BESA, a small Albanian party, won the mayorship after an eight-year rule by DUI, the largest Albanian party.",3,"Voters are largely free to make political decisions, though reports of intimidation and vote buying remain an issue, especially among Roma and other socially vulnerable groups. Patronage networks remain influential in political life and can influence political outcomes.",2,"There are no formal barriers that prevent various segments of the population from participating in political life, but in practice, structural barriers exist for some groups. Small ethnic political parties representing Albanians have sat in each ruling coalition, and Turkish, Serbian, and Bosnian minorities are comparatively well integrated. Roma remain politically marginalized.Despite the introduction of parity laws and joint initiatives by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and electoral authorities, societal attitudes discourage women from participating in politics. Women represent 41.7 per cent of the Assembly but are not as well represented at the local level.Small LGBT+ advocacy groups are politically active, but overall LGBT+ people have little political representation. An LGBT+ working group established in 2018 is active but not highly influential.Census data released in 2022 showed a 9.2 percent population decline since the last count two decades ago, but that the ethnic makeup of the country remained mostly the same. Ethnic Albanians make up 24.3 percent of the population, remaining above the 20 percent legal threshold that grants certain official minority rights, such as the ability to make Albanian an official state language and to qualify for public-sector employment quotas. Members of the ethnic Turkish community—the country’s third-largest ethnic group—voiced concerns over the census results, claiming that they showed an unrealistically low percentage of Turks (3.86 percent).",3
norway,A range of political parties operate freely in Norway.,4,"Norway has a long history of democratic and peaceful transfers of power after elections. The center-left Labour Party, and center-right coalitions led by the Conservatives or the Christian Democrats, have typically rotated in and out of government. Smaller parties wield influence by participating in national and local coalitions.",4,"Citizens are generally free from undue interference in their political choices, and no military, foreign, or religious entities exert undemocratic pressure on voters. Public funding is the main source of party revenue, though private contributions have increased in recent years, which critics say could allow wealthy donors to acquire undue influence over Norwegian politics.",4,"Women and minority groups enjoy full political rights and electoral opportunities. Following the September 2021 elections, 50 percent of cabinet positions are held by women, and 45 percent of parliamentarians are women. Minority ethnic groups and the interests of LGBT+ people are addressed through robust antidiscrimination laws and various protections for same-sex couples.The Indigenous Sámi population, in addition to participating in the national political process, has its own legislature, the Sameting, which has worked to protect the group’s language and cultural rights and to influence the national government’s decisions about Sámi land and resources. The national government has a deputy minister tasked specifically with handling Sámi issues. A 2021 Supreme Court case confirmed that Sami cultural rights take precedence over the expansion of windfarms that impact reindeer herding.",4

The structure of the constitutional system excludes the possibility of a change in government through elections.,0,"The nonpartisan nature of Oman’s limited elections, the overwhelming dominance of the sultan in Omani society, and the authorities’ suppression of dissent leave voters and candidates with little autonomy in their political choices.",1,"Noncitizens, who make up about 46 percent of the population, have no political rights or electoral opportunities. Citizenship is generally transmitted from Omani fathers. Foreign residents must live legally in the country for 20 years to qualify for citizenship, or 15 and 10 years for foreign husbands and wives of Omani citizens, respectively, if they have a son. These and other conditions make naturalizations relatively rare.Omani women can legally vote and run for office, but they have few practical opportunities to organize independently and advance their interests in the political system. Two women were elected to the Consultative Council in 2019, up from one in 2015. Fifteen women serve on the appointed Council of State.",1
pakistan,"Several major parties and numerous smaller parties and independents compete in elections and are represented in the parliament and provincial legislatures. However, established parties maintain patronage networks and other advantages of incumbency that hamper competition in their respective provincial strongholds. In recent years, major parties’ freedom to operate has been related to the strength of their relationships with unelected arms of the state, which have used legal and extralegal means to sideline figures they object to.",2,"Opposition parties campaign and contest elections, which regularly end with transfers of power at the national level. National opposition parties also hold power or significant provincial representation. However, the military, despite its claims to refrain from political interference, has long been considered more powerful than elected politicians and able to influence electoral outcomes.Other official bodies have been used to impede political parties. In recent years, the PPP and PML-N faced a succession of charges from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the government’s anticorruption body, leading to multiple court appearances and periodic detentions. Nawaz Sharif of the PML-N, the current premier’s brother, was banned from office in 2018 over corruption accusations; he remains in self-imposed exile in London but is politically active. After being ousted in April 2022, Imran Khan and other PTI leaders faced judicial and administrative scrutiny; in August, Khan received terrorism charges over a speech delivered at a PTI rally.In October 2022, Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) founder Manzoor Pashteen was arrested on terror-related charges over a speech he delivered on enforced disappearances. PTM lawmaker Ali Wazir remained imprisoned at year’s end despite being cleared of terrorism charges in October; he continues to face sedition charges. In November, PTM cofounder Mohsin Dawar was prevented from traveling abroad.",2,"The manipulation of politics by religious extremists has long hampered voters’ ability to freely express their political preferences. The TLP, a militant party adhering to the Sufi Barelvi tradition, was banned for part of 2021 but refrained from agitation in 2022. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) reemerged in the Swat Valley and other Pashtun-majority areas along the frontier with Afghanistan in 2022, engaging in extortion and intimidation.In recent years, the military has reasserted its role as a political arbiter—more powerful than either the judiciary or the elected government—setting the constraints within which civilian politics play out.The heavy presence of security agents at many polling stations in 2018 was interpreted by observers as tantamount to voter intimidation. Several candidates had links with extremist groups that advocated or engaged in violence, further contributing to a sense of unease among many voters.",1,"A joint electorate system allows members of non-Muslim minorities to participate in the general vote. They are also represented by reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies through the party-list system. However, non-Muslims’ political participation remains marginal. Political parties nominate members to reserved legislative seats, leaving non-Muslim voters with little say in the selection process. Ahmadis, members of a heterodox Muslim sect, face political discrimination and are registered on a separate voter roll.Political parties maintain women’s wings that are active during elections, but women face practical restrictions on voting, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan, where militant groups and societal constraints are stronger. Women rarely hold political-party or government leadership positions. The interests of LGBT+ people are generally not represented by elected officials.The national-level single-member constituency system ensures that the major ethno-linguistic groups from each province receive parliamentary representation. Although Sindhi, Pashtun, and Baloch figures all play visible roles in national political life—alongside the largest ethno-linguistic group, Punjabis—the military works to marginalize figures from minority groups it suspects of harboring antistate sentiments, as exemplified by its treatment of the PTM.",1

Power is transferred democratically between rival politicians.",4,"Palau receives financial assistance from the United States under the CoFA, but the US government does not exert improper influence over the country’s internal politics. While the political views of traditional chiefs are respected, they do not have authoritative control over the choices of voters.",4,"Women generally have equal political rights in law and in practice. Some state-level legislative seats are reserved for male chiefs, who in turn are customarily chosen by councils of women elders. After the November 2020 polls, only one woman held a seat in each chamber of the National Congress.About a third of the population consists of foreign nationals who do not have political rights in Palau. Citizenship must be inherited from at least one parent, as there are no provisions for naturalization.In 2019, former president John Toribiong (2009–13) launched a petition seeking to amend the constitution in order to end the acceptance of absentee ballots, asserting that citizens living outside the country wielded too much political influence.",3

Though advocacy organizations have campaigned to improve women’s representation in elected office, it remains low, and electoral code reforms adopted in October 2021 removed previously required gender-parity regulations. In the 2019 election only 22.5 percent of National Assembly seats went to women. That election also saw the first woman from the Guna Indigenous group take her seat. The constitution establishes five Indigenous territories—three at the provincial level and two at the municipal level—and these are duly represented in the system of constituencies for the National Assembly, but the interests of Indigenous people, who make up about 11 percent of the population, remain inadequately addressed by the political system.",3
papua-new-guinea,"Political parties are able to form and operate freely, but many candidates run as independents and join factions only after reaching Parliament. Electoral loyalties are driven by local and personal factors at the constituency level. Lawmakers frequently switch affiliations and alliances.Prime Minister Marape transformed Pangu, the country’s oldest party, into his vehicle for reelection in 2022, and it emerged from the balloting as the largest party in Parliament.",4,"The opposition has a reasonable chance of dislodging the government through elections, defections, or no-confidence votes. Since independence in 1975, only two governments have served a full five-year term: the Michael Somare–led government of 2002–07 and the O’Neill-led government of 2012–17. The law granting the largest party the first opportunity to form a government creates an electoral advantage for sitting prime ministers, adding to the incentive of taking power through midterm no-confidence votes before facing elections. Incumbent governments have won all four elections since 2007.The frequency of no-confidence votes is limited by a provision that grants an incoming prime minister an 18-month “grace period.” Another grace period takes effect 12 months before the next scheduled elections. However, no-confidence votes remain regular occurrences. Marape’s current postelection grace period will expire in 2024.",4,"In coastal and lowland areas, most citizens and candidates are generally free to make political choices without undue interference. However, in the Highlands, many local leaders, politicians, and candidate agents control the balloting process and complete the ballot papers in bulk—a form of “assisted voting.” As a result, the affected citizens are essentially denied the right to vote.",2,"Although all citizens have equal political rights under the law, women are underrepresented in elected offices. Only two women were elected to the 118-member Parliament in 2022. Proposals to establish reserved seats for women have not been successful to date. LGBT+ people face societal discrimination that impedes their ability to advocate for their interests in the political sphere.A 2001 peace agreement ended a civil war in Bougainville and provided for an independence referendum in the ethnically diverse autonomous region. Over 180,000 people participated in a nonbinding referendum in 2019, and 97.7 percent voted for independence. In a 2021 statement, Marape and Bougainville president Ishmael Toroama agreed to finalize a political settlement “no earlier than 2025 and no later than 2027.” The 2001 peace agreement requires the National Parliament to make the ultimate decision on whether Bougainville becomes independent.",3

Former president Fernando Lugo was able to come to power in 2008 due to a split in the ruling Colorado Party, while a liberal-left coalition came close to taking the presidency in 2018. The Concertación, a centrist coalition, hopes to secure victory in 2023. In addition, rival factions within the Colorado Party serve as a kind of internal opposition and have recently alternated in power. However, the formidable Colorado party machinery stacks the cards in its own favor. Structural obstacles to independent trade unions and a judicial crackdown on peasant-farmer organizations also weaken the potential bases for a strong electoral opposition, while the lack of a runoff mechanism means the fractured opposition has to field a united slate.",4,"Citizens are generally free from direct interference in their political choices. However, the ruling Colorado Party has been accused of using its extensive patronage network and access to public-sector jobs to buy votes. In September 2022, a Colorado mayor was accused of retaining the ID cards of Indigenous voters in order to influence their ballots.",3,"Political office is overwhelmingly dominated by male and White or mestizo individuals.

Though there are limits on individual donations, there are no constraints on spending by political parties, offering an outsized advantage to parties able to secure abundant funds.Since the party system collapsed during Alberto Fujimori’s authoritarian regime in the 1990s, the political system in Peru has been described by academic observers as a “democracy without parties.” Traditional political parties have been replaced by fragile and opportunistic political organizations that often have a very short life and little dedication to democratic practices.",4,"Opposition political parties have a realistic chance of winning power through elections, and the outcomes of elections at both the national and regional levels are subject to effective competition. Fragmentation, rather than lack of political opportunities, is the biggest obstacle faced by political actors attempting to gain and exercise power.",4,"While voters and candidates are generally able to exercise their political choices without undue influence, businesses regularly seek to bribe or otherwise influence political candidates’ positions.",3,"The concerns of members of ethnic and cultural minority groups, especially in remote mountain and Amazonian areas, remain inadequately addressed in politics. The 2011 Law of Prior Consultation attempted to improve the participation of Indigenous groups by guaranteeing consultation before mining and other development projects are undertaken. However, Indigenous groups have criticized the law, as the process gives Indigenous representatives no veto power, and there are ambiguities as to what qualifies a community as Indigenous.While the political participation of women has increased over recent years, women hold few leadership roles in local and regional governments. In June 2020, Congress passed a law requiring moves toward full gender parity on party lists. After the 2021 elections, women make up 40 percent of the legislature, with 52 women holding seats in Congress.

philippines,"The Philippines has a strong record of open competition among multiple parties, though candidates and parties typically have weak ideological profiles. Legislative coalitions are exceptionally fluid, and politicians often change party affiliation, typically to join the dominant bloc or the incumbent president’s party.",3,"The risk of becoming a victim of political violence and a lack of access to state resources for those not in power hinder the opposition’s ability to challenge incumbents. Campaign finance rules, which make elections very costly, impede the ability of grassroots movements to mobilize, participate in, and win elections. Robredo’s 2022 campaign gained considerable grassroots support, however, with some rallies attracting hundreds of thousands of people.Opposition candidates at times encounter politically motivated criminal charges that can result in imprisonment. Leila de Lima, who was elected to the Senate in 2016, campaigned for the 2022 elections from her detention center but lost. Since 2017 she has been detained on charges of accepting money from drug dealers and is recognized as a prisoner of conscience by international rights groups. Walden Bello, a vocal critic of the Marcoses and Dutertes, and the running mate of presidential candidate Leody de Guzman, was arrested in August on criminal libel charges. (The United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), international rights groups, and most democratic governments consider criminal penalties for libel cases a grossly disproportionate restriction on free speech.)Senior government officials have openly “red-tagged” opposition figures, prompting serious harassment. Red-tagging is the tactic of alleging that an individual harbors communist—and thus terrorist—sympathies or connections, resulting in stigmatization and increased risk of physical attack.Campaign events sometimes feature violence. One month before the 2022 elections, in April, shots were fired during a campaign event for de Guzman. Five people were injured.",2,"Distribution of power is heavily affected by patronage and kinship networks. Election-related funding also contributes to the concentration of power: there are no limits on campaign contributions, and a significant portion of political donations come from a relatively small number of donors.Social media platforms have been exploited to disseminate disinformation on a grand scale, and hyperpartisan online news outlets routinely amplify misleading content. In 2022, the Marcos campaign used social media extensively to spread false information regarding economic development and human rights during Ferdinand Marcos’s dictatorship. In a 2022 survey by Pulse Asia, 86 percent of respondents said that fake news was a problem and that the public was exposed to it.",2,"No law limits the participation of specific groups in the political process, and the constitution guarantees equal access to opportunities for public service. However, the dominance of political dynasties is an obstacle to the exercise of political rights for some groups, and electoral opportunities are limited to those who can afford the cost of running for public office. While women make up about 29 percent of the Senate and 27 percent of the House, most are members of politically powerful families. Muslims and Indigenous groups are not well represented. Perceptions of relative socioeconomic deprivation and political disenfranchisement, along with resentment toward Christian settlements in traditionally Muslim areas, have played a central role in the Philippines’ Muslim separatist movements.In June 2022, Risa Hontiveros, the lone opposition candidate who won a seat in the year’s Senate elections, said she would push for the approval of an antidiscrimination bill in Congress that has been pending for a number of years.",3

The July 2021 changes to the electoral law distinguished between “native” Qataris, whose families settled in Qatar before 1930, and naturalized citizens, who are unable to vote. Qatari women enjoy some political rights, though they have little opportunity to organize independently and advocate for their interests. In the 2019 municipal council elections, 5 of the 85 candidates were women, and 2 of them—both incumbents—won seats.

Putin served two four-year presidential terms from 2000 to 2008, remained the de facto paramount leader when returning to the prime ministership, and again became president in 2012, violating the spirit if not the letter of the constitution’s two-term limit. A 2008 constitutional amendment extended presidential terms to six years, and a 2020 amendment allowed Putin to run for an additional two terms, meaning he could remain in office until 2036.Opposition politicians and activists are frequently targeted with fabricated criminal cases and other forms of administrative harassment designed to prevent their participation in the political process. Aleksey Navalny was poisoned with a toxic nerve agent in 2020, with evidence later emerging that the FSB poisoned him. Navalny, who sought medical attention in Germany, was arrested upon his return in January 2021 for violating probation. In January 2022, Navalny and eight prominent supporters were added to the government’s terrorist-and-extremist registry. In March, Navalny—who was already imprisoned in a penal colony—received a nine-year sentence over embezzlement and contempt-of-court charges in a politically motivated trial.Legislation enacted in 2021 banned individuals associated with extremist organizations from running for election. Among other restrictions, Russian citizens who hold a second citizenship or a foreign residence permit and people who have been found guilty of one of 400 criminal and administrative offenses were unable to run for office as of that year. Also in 2021, Golos reported that nearly one-tenth of all Russian adults had effectively been denied the right to run.",0,"Russia’s numerous security agencies work to maintain tight control over society and prevent any political challenges to the regime. The country’s leadership is also closely intertwined with powerful business magnates who benefit from government patronage in exchange for political loyalty and various forms of service. The Russian Orthodox Church similarly works to support the status quo, receiving financial support and a privileged status in return. Many employers—particularly in the public sector—pressure their employees to vote, partly to deliver the government’s desired level of voter turnout.",1,"The formation of parties based on ethnicity or religion is not permitted by law. In practice, many regions inhabited by distinct ethnic groups are carefully monitored and controlled by federal authorities. Most republics in the North Caucasus area and some autonomous districts in energy-rich western Siberia have opted out of direct gubernatorial elections; instead, their legislatures choose a governor from candidates proposed by the president.Women are underrepresented in politics and government, holding only 16.2 percent of Duma seats and 21.9 percent of Federation Council seats. Few women serve as cabinet members, and many issues of importance to women are not prominent in Russian politics.LGBT+ people face major challenges in pursuing their political interests. Marriage was defined as a union between a man and a woman under constitutional amendments enacted in 2021. In April 2022, a court effectively shuttered the LGBT Network and its parent nongovernmental organization (NGO), the Charitable Sphere Foundation; the Justice Ministry had accused the latter of engaging in “political activities using foreign property.”",1
rwanda,"The constitution guarantees the right to organize and freely operate political parties within the bounds of the law. The government-controlled Rwanda Governance Board (RGB) is responsible for registering political parties, and in practice it can deny registration at its discretion without proper justification.The government has a long history of repressing its political opponents, and members of opposition parties face the threat of disappearance, arbitrary arrest and detention, and assassination. Several members of the Dalfa-Umurinzi party, led by 2010 presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire, were convicted in 2020 of involvement with an “irregular armed force” and “offenses against the state,” receiving prison terms ranging from 7 to 10 years. One defendant who was acquitted, Venant Abayisenga, was reported missing later that year and was believed to have been forcibly disappeared or killed.",1,"The RPF has ruled Rwanda without interruption since 1994, banning and repressing any opposition group that could mount a serious challenge to its leadership. All registered parties currently belong to the NCFPO, which the RPF dominates. While the DGPR won two parliamentary seats in 2018, current conditions generally prevent it from gaining further positions of authority or viably competing with the RPF.",0,"Both voters and candidates face significant intimidation aimed at controlling their political choices. Rwandans living outside the country have been threatened, attacked, forcibly disappeared, or killed, apparently in retaliation for their public or suspected opposition to the regime.The military was formally separated from the RPF after it won the civil war, but it retains close ties to the ruling party and is considered a key political stakeholder in practice.",0,"The constitution calls on the president to ensure “representation of historically marginalized communities” in the Senate through his appointees. However, asserting one’s ethnic identity in politics is banned, meaning the level of representation is unclear. The prohibition on discussion of ethnicity makes it nearly impossible for disadvantaged groups—including the Twa, an Indigenous group—to organize independently and advocate for their interests.The constitution requires women to occupy at least 30 percent of the seats in each chamber of Parliament. While women currently hold more than a third of Senate seats and about 61 percent of the lower house seats, they have little practical ability to engage in politics outside the RPF structure. The promotion of gender equity disproportionately privileges English-speaking Tutsis over French-speaking Hutus and rural Tutsis. Societal discrimination, as well as the regime’s general repression of dissent, prevents LGBT+ Rwandans from freely pursuing their communities’ political interests.",1

samoa,"There are no major constraints on the formation and operation of political parties, but parties must win a minimum of eight seats to qualify for formal recognition within the legislature. The opposition Tautua Samoa Party fell from 13 seats to two after the 2016 elections, leaving the parliament with just one recognized party. However, several other parties registered in the years leading up to the April 2021 elections, including FAST in 2020, and the elections themselves confirmed that there were no significant obstacles to party formation and competition.",4,"There are no obvious obstacles that prevent the opposition from increasing its support and gaining power through elections. The former HRPP government, having been in power since the 1980s, developed an effective campaign machinery during its incumbency, but it harmed its own interests in the 2021 elections by allowing multiple candidates to run in single districts, splitting its vote and facilitating opposition victories. In 2020, two smaller opposition parties—Tumua ma Puleono and the Samoa National Democratic Party—had announced that they would contest the 2021 elections as an alliance under the FAST banner. The opposition benefited from a number of preelection defections from the HRPP, including that of Fiame Naomi Mata‘afa herself, who had served as a deputy prime minister until September 2020.Although the HRPP incumbents contested the FAST victory in 2021, the courts ultimately ensured a democratic transfer of power. The opposition leader and former HRPP prime minister, Tuila‘epa Sa‘ilele Malielegaoi, and the secretary of the HRPP, Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi, were suspended indefinitely from Parliament in May 2022 for contempt of court charges, but the suspension was declared void by the Supreme Court in August. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling, FAST used its majority in parliament in October to suspend them for two years, on the same grounds.In March 2022, former prime minister Tuila‘epa and several of his HRPP colleagues were found guilty of contempt of court for their actions and statements in the aftermath of the 2021 general election, but no penalty was imposed.",3,"While voters and candidates are largely free from undue interference with their political choices, traditional village councils consisting of local leaders with matai titles exercise considerable influence through candidate endorsements. Those who use the electoral laws to challenge the councils’ preferred candidates in court have sometimes faced customary penalties such as banishment.",3,"While women and members of ethnic minority groups have full voting rights, individuals must hold a matai title to qualify as electoral candidates, meaning fewer women are eligible in practice. A sizeable minority of villages still do not allow women to hold matai titles, and few women participate in village council meetings. Members of the fa‘afafine community—Samoans who are assigned male gender at birth but have a fluid or feminine gender identity—can also be matai, though they have generally not run as candidates in elections to date.The 2016 elections marked the first application of the gender quota ensuring that at least 10 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women. If fewer than that number are elected in normal constituency contests, the unsuccessful women candidates with the most votes are awarded additional seats. One extra seat was consequently added to the 2016 parliament, two were added after the 2021 by-elections, and a third was added because of a Supreme Court ruling in May 2022, though this was reversed on appeal in November.",3

Some of the country’s most prominent political rights organizations and activists, including founding members of the banned Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), have been arrested and sentenced to prison in recent years; one founder, Abdullah al-Hamid, died in custody in 2020. Many other political activists continue to serve lengthy prison sentences. The National Assembly Party (NAAS), which was founded abroad by Saudi exiles in 2020, claimed in July 2022 that one of its key members, Manea al-Yami, had been killed in Beirut under suspicious circumstances. Lebanese security forces issued a statement alleging that al-Yami’s brothers had stabbed him to death for “family reasons.” The official Saudi Press Agency did not report on al-Yami’s death.",0,"The monarchy is explicitly opposed to democracy in the country.

Prominent reformist clerics Salman al-Awdah, Awad al-Qarni, and Ali al-Omari were arrested in 2017 for “plotting against the state,” seemingly because they were perceived as sympathetic to the Qatari government and the Muslim Brotherhood. All three remained detained without basic due process rights at the end of 2022, pending trials that have been repeatedly and arbitrarily delayed, and they potentially face the death penalty.",0,"The monarchy generally excludes the public from any meaningful political participation. In the absence of political parties, voters in Saudi Arabia’s limited municipal elections have been heavily influenced by tribal and religious leaders, many of whom benefit from close ties to the ruling establishment.",0,"Although political rights are curtailed for all Saudi citizens, women, members of religious minorities, and LGBT+ people face additional obstacles to participation given the kingdom’s strict laws and customs on matters including gender segregation and sexual activity, and its intolerance of religious groups that deviate from the state-sanctioned interpretation of Sunni Islam. Women make up 30 of the 150 members of the appointed Majlis al-Shura. Members of religious minorities and women are largely excluded from the council’s leadership positions, though a woman was appointed as deputy speaker in 2020. Women secured about 1 percent of the seats in the 2015 municipal council elections. Shiites reportedly hold a small number of Majlis al-Shura seats and many municipal council seats in Shiite-majority areas. In 2022, several women were appointed to or continued to serve in relatively high-ranking positions in bodies such as cabinet, the stock exchange, and the sovereign wealth fund. Tribes that have close kinship ties with King Salman, especially from the Najd region, have historically held privileged positions in government. The Majlis al-Shura includes members of prominent tribal groups, and the National Guard, one of the country’s military forces, has relied on tribal loyalties. However, the political influence of tribal networks has ostensibly waned, as the king and the crown prince seek to modernize the state, curb the influence of potentially autonomous social forces, and consolidate an elite whose political loyalty is independent of social identity. Noncitizens, who make up roughly one-third of the population in Saudi Arabia, have no political rights, and citizenship can only be directly transmitted by a citizen father whose marriage is recognized by the state.",0
senegal,"Registration requirements for new political parties are not onerous, and registered parties can organize and operate without government interference. There are over 300 registered parties, and the proliferation of parties was raised as a concern during the national dialogue. However, opposition candidates still face major financial inequities when competing with incumbents. There is no public financing for political parties, but the ruling party deploys a vast set of state resources to garner support, whereas opposition leaders are often forced to rely on personal wealth to finance party operations or on political alliances to access power.",3,"The opposition can increase its support or gain power through elections, though the government has taken steps—including prosecuting opposition politicians—that appear designed to interfere with their ability to do so.Several opposition politicians were barred from running in the 2022 legislative elections, most notably Sonko. The 2018 electoral law was criticized by opposition leaders for making it more difficult for candidates to appear on the ballot, and was widely seen as a move to clear the field and ensure President Sall’s 2019 reelection. The prosecutions of some of Sall’s most prominent political opponents in recent years has also reduced the competitiveness of the opposition. In March 2021, Sonko was arrested on charges of rape, leading to widespread protests. Sonko repeatedly denied the allegations, saying that the charge was a politically motivated attempt to exclude him from the 2024 presidential race. Sonko remained under judicial supervision and was denied permission to leave the country.In June 2022, opposition member of parliament Dethie Fall received a six-month suspended sentence for his role in organizing an unauthorized protest following the opposition list disqualification. Also in June, another member of parliament, Abdou Bara Dolly, was arrested on charges of insulting the president and disseminating false news at an opposition rally.In January 2019, the Constitutional Council ruled that Khalifa Sall, a former mayor of Dakar, and Karim Wade, the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade, were both ineligible to run in the 2019 presidential election because both had previously been sentenced to prison terms for corruption. The opposition’s ability to compete with President Sall was also lessened by the president’s decision to appoint opposition figures from the Rewmi Party to government posts in November 2020.",3,"People’s political choices are largely free from domination by groups that are not democratically accountable.

Women are better represented in the National Assembly, holding 73 seats and representing over 44 percent of the body after the 2022 legislative elections. This is partially due to a 2010 law requiring gender parity on candidate lists.

However, the SNS has used various tactics to unfairly reduce the opposition’s electoral prospects. These include manipulating the timing of snap elections, exerting pressure on independent state institutions, and mobilizing public resources to support its campaigns. The SNS has expanded its influence over the media through both state-owned enterprises and an array of private outlets that are dependent on government funding, and has harnessed this influence to strengthen its political position and discredit its rivals, further reducing opposition parties’ competitiveness. Opposition figures have also faced escalating harassment and violence in recent years. Pervasive harassment, intimidation, and manipulation has resulted in suppressed political representation of opposition parties at any level. In April 2022, local elections were held in 13 municipalities, including the city of Belgrade. Following the elections, the SNS maintained nearly complete dominance over state governance—SNS-led coalitions took or held power in all 13 locations—and retained local-level control of all but 7 of 168 towns and municipalities. Nevertheless, a number of opposition parties, including a new green-left coalition, We Must (Moramo), which formed in January 2022, were able to cross the electoral threshold and enter the parliament following the April elections.",1,"Voters enjoy a significant degree of freedom to make political decisions without undue interference, though the ruling party and allied private businesses allegedly use patronage networks to influence political outcomes. Various incentives have also been employed in recent years to convince hundreds of local elected officials to form alliances with the SNS or change their party affiliation after elections. SNS electoral campaigns have allegedly benefited from the misuse of public resources, such as the use of public buses to transport loyalists to rallies. Local observers reported that workers at state-owned enterprises were pressured to support the ruling SNS during the April 2022 elections. SNS operatives have also been known to intimidate voters directly, by appearing at their homes and pressuring them to support the party. Separately, Russia has been accused of attempting to influence Serbian politics through its state-owned media and an array of small pro-Russian parties, media outlets, and civil society groups in Serbia.",2,"The country’s electoral threshold for parliamentary representation does not apply to parties representing ethnic minorities.

The perpetrator, found dead after the attack, had published a White supremacist manifesto indicating his homophobic and antisemitic stance. The parliament passed a resolution condemning the Bratislava shooting, but the same month failed to pass a legislative proposal that would have increased the legal standing of same-sex partnerships by expanding inheritance and other rights.

Suidani’s key advisor, Celsus Irokwato Talifilu, raised concerns that Sogavare could deploy Chinese armed police to quell democratic dissent and remain in office. In December 2021, the organization Malaita for Democracy (M4D) was declared illegal, alleging that individuals linked to the group played a key role in the November riots of that year. In April 2022, the Solomon Islands government signed a security deal with China that reportedly allows deployment of Chinese security forces to quell disorder and to protect foreign-owned assets.Beijing provides financial backing for the Rural Constituency Development Fund (RCDF), which is disbursed by Solomon Islands parliamentarians. In July 2022, government reports revealed that the RCDF had expended SBD$2.26 billion (US$272.3 million) between 2015 and 2022.",3,"Women and ethnic minorities enjoy full political rights under the law, but discrimination limits political opportunities for women in practice.

The system is also affected by intraclan rivalries and dominated by clan leaders, who do not necessarily represent the common interests of their respective groups.Women’s political participation is limited by discriminatory attitudes and hostility from incumbent elites, and the interests of women are poorly represented in practice. The parliamentary framework mandates a 30 percent quota for women’s representation, but the elections that ended in April 2022 resulted in only 54 women in the House of the People (less than 20 percent); there are 14 women in the Upper House (less than 26 percent).",0

That September, an ANC incumbent candidate in Pretoria, Tshepo Motaung, was shot and killed by unknown gunmen suspected to be linked to a rival faction. Three ANC supporters were shot and killed during a meeting to nominate candidates in KwaZulu-Natal.

In its May 2022 policy discussion document, the ANC stated that the party faces the prospect of losing its majority in the 2024 national elections.",3,"People’s political choices in South Africa are largely free from domination by external actors, and the military generally stays out of politics.

In September 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for officials in senior executive positions, including the president and government ministers, not to declare funding they had received for intraparty campaigns.

At the same time, officials were investigating possible ties between the Catalan independence movement and the Russian government.It was reported in April that Spain’s intelligence services had used the commercial spyware system Pegasus to surveil Catalan politicians and other targets between 2015 and 2020. Although the spyware was apparently used in accordance with the law, a European Parliament committee found that the monitoring affected people who were not part of an official investigation or criminal proceeding, and that a lack of information from the Spanish authorities left it unclear whether the targets posed a genuine threat to national security.

tanzania,"Tanzanians have the right to organize into political parties, but the ruling CCM enjoys considerable incumbency advantages that stifle competition. The system of state funding for parties under the Political Parties Act (PPA) of 2015 disproportionately benefits the CCM. Political parties are regulated by a presidentially appointed registrar whom the opposition criticizes for partisan bias. Authorities have constrained opposition parties in recent years. In 2016, the government banned all political rallies and demonstrations outside election periods, sharply curtailing parties’ ability to mobilize public support. In 2019, opposition groups’ rights were further constrained by PPA amendments that empower a government minister to regulate party coalition formation, ban internationally sourced political fundraising, prohibit parties from “activism,” and introduce tools that the registrar can use to investigate and interfere with targeted parties’ internal operations. The amendments also gave the registrar legal immunity, further reducing that office’s accountability.The Hassan administration has also targeted opposition activities, though it has more recently opened dialogue with prominent opposition figures. In February 2022, President Hassan met with Tundu Lissu in Belgium. Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe was released from custody in March 2022; in 2021, he and at least 10 other Chadema members were arrested before Mbowe was to give a speech on constitutional reform. Mbowe was charged with terrorism but those charges were dropped. Hassan and Mbowe went on to hold two meetings during the year. Relatively few opposition figures were arrested or detained in 2022, though local-level activists and those working for constitutional reform were targeted. Opposition groups’ day-to-day activities are severely curtailed due to a Magufuli-era ban on public meetings, which remained in place at year’s end. While opposition leaders have been able to hold meetings and give speeches to party members in regional capitals, police and security forces delayed or disrupted these meetings.",1,"The CCM has governed without interruption for over 60 years.

The political space for opposition parties narrowed due to repression in the 2020 election.Opposition prospects have not markedly improved under Hassan. Prominent CCM figures still describe the opposition as the enemy; in October 2022, National Assembly speaker Tulia Ackson called on CCM members to “deal with” Hassan’s critics in remarks that were interpreted as a call to violence. Tundu Lissu, who traveled abroad to recover after a 2017 attempted assassination, returned to Tanzania to stand as Chadema’s presidential candidate in 2020. Lissu fled for Belgium after the polls and remained in exile at the end of 2022.",1,"Tanzanian voters and politicians are subject to significant undue influence from unaccountable entities using antidemocratic tactics. During his tenure, Magufuli exerted pressure through local administrative authorities, particularly presidentially appointed regional and district commissioners. These officials are technically nonpartisan, but most are CCM loyalists or former security personnel. They have significant power within their jurisdictions and have been especially repressive when overseeing opposition-oriented areas. President Hassan appointed new regional and district commissioners in 2021; some appointees came from opposition groups or were nonpartisan, though hardliners maintained some posts. Civil servants in opposition-controlled councils are under significant pressure to follow directives from CCM officials, rather than elected opposition politicians. The government has sought to remove elected municipal leaders, and arbitrarily threatened and barred the movements and activities of critical NGOs and human rights advocates. The 2019 local elections, which the opposition boycotted due to widespread candidate disqualifications, were managed by the government ministry that also supervises regional and district commissioners.",1,"Members of ethnic, religious, and other minority groups ostensibly have full political rights, but the participation of some groups is limited in practice. Magufuli, a member of the Sukuma ethnic group, often appointed fellow Sukuma to government positions during his tenure. This represented a departure from predecessors who balanced ethnic and religious groups. This Magufuli-era imbalance remains to a lesser extent under President Hassan.Women hold 36.8 percent of legislative seats; the constitution requires that 30 percent of seats are held by women. However, women are underrepresented in directly elected seats, which are consistently won by male candidates. Women who run for office face mistreatment.Hassan, Tanzania’s first female president, has promoted women’s representation in her own government. After the October 2022 cabinet reshuffle, about half of its posts were held by women. Tulia Ackson was elected National Assembly speaker in February, making her only the second woman to hold this position. However, misogynistic discourse and behavior have persisted in politics.

thailand,"From 2014 to 2018, Thailand’s military government effectively banned political parties from meeting and conducting activities. In late 2018, the NCPO lifted many restrictions on political parties, allowing them to hold meetings, recruit members, select candidates, and meet with the public. A slew of parties from across the political spectrum began organizing and campaigning in preparation for the 2019 elections, though those opposed to military rule experienced official harassment.In 2019, after the success of the Future Forward Party (FFP) in that year’s elections, party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit was charged with crimes including sedition for allegedly “assisting” democracy activists after a 2015 protest. He was subsequently suspended by the Constitutional Court from taking his seat over a complaint that he had held shares in a media company while applying to serve in the legislature. In early 2020, the FFP was abolished following a Constitutional Court ruling that a loan it received from Thanathorn constituted an illegal donation. Opposition parties aligned with exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra have also experienced harassment by authorities. The military-drafted constitution imposes rules designed to weaken established parties like the PTP, which led the pre-2014 government. To circumvent these limitations, PTP leaders established like-minded parties, including Thai Raksa Chart (TRC), to better compete in the 2019 elections. However, after TRC nominated Princess Ubolratana—the monarch’s older sister—as its prime ministerial candidate, the party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court and its candidates were disqualified.",1,"After an effective military ban on political parties from 2014 to 2018, opposition parties were able to compete in the 2019 polls and won a large number of seats in the House of Representatives. However, constitutional restraints greatly limited the ability of these opposition parties to effectively campaign. Postelectoral manipulation on the part of the government also reduced the total number of seats won by the opposition.While parties opposed to military rule, most prominently the PTP and the FFP, won a combined 245 lower-house seats, they have been unable to advance legislation due to the military’s control of the unelected Senate and legislative processes. The 2020 dissolution of the FFP, whose 80 seats had made it the third-largest force in the House of Representatives, was accompanied by a 10-year ban on political participation for 16 party leaders, including party leader Thanathorn and 10 other elected representatives. Following the ruling, FFP’s remaining elected representatives established a new political party called Move Forward. In late 2021, the National Assembly passed an amendment reducing the number of lower-house party-list seats from 150 to 100, increasing the threshold needed to win them and making it more difficult for smaller opposition parties to win representation.In May 2022, former PTP transport minister Chadchart Sittipunt, running as an independent, won the Bangkok governor’s election in a landslide. His victory reflected public discontent with the military-backed government and an improving political environment for opposition candidates.",1,"While Thai citizens were able to vote in 2019, the resulting government did not reflect election results due to a rigged outcome enabled by the military-drafted constitution and postelection manipulation. Thailand’s cabinet is stacked with former members of the military, leaders of the 2014 coup, and ministerial holdovers from the junta, including Prime Minister Prayuth.The 2019 polls were subject to repeated interventions by the monarchy, which exerts tremendous influence over Thai politics. For instance, the Constitutional Court’s dissolution order targeting TRC came soon after King Maha Vajiralongkorn made a televised announcement condemning his sister Princess Ubolratana’s prime ministerial bid as “extremely inappropriate.” On the eve of the 2019 election, King Vajiralongkorn released an unprecedented statement urging citizens to vote for “good people” to prevent “chaos,” a message widely understood as a royal endorsement of promilitary parties. In late 2021, the Constitutional Court issued a ruling stating that activists’ calls for political reform, including of the monarchy, amounted to an attempt to overthrow the state. No charges were consequently issued against the dissenters, but the ruling was viewed as an assertion by the courts of the monarchy’s sovereign power over the country.",0,"In 2019, some political rights denied to the population during military rule were restored with the election of a semicivilian government. Nevertheless, members of minority groups, particularly ethnic minorities and stateless residents, are generally unable to choose their representatives or organize independently to assert their interests in the political sphere. Malay Muslims in southern Thailand remain marginalized.Women are underrepresented in government at all levels, composing only 15.8 percent of the House of Representatives and 10.5 percent of the Senate. Few women hold leadership roles in political parties. Women’s interests are generally not prioritized in political life, although recent antigovernment protests included demands for greater attention to these issues.The interests of LGBT+ people are increasingly represented in national politics.",1
timor-leste,"Political parties are generally free to operate. Some campaign-finance regulations favor larger parties. These include a lack of spending caps and a system in which government campaign subsidies are awarded after elections, according to the number of votes a party has won.Two new parties, youth-aligned KHUNTO and the PLP, won 13 parliamentary seats between them in 2017. They joined AMP in the 2018 elections and formed a governing coalition with Fretilin in 2020.",4,"Democratic transfers of power occur regularly in Timor-Leste.While some smaller parties hold parliamentary seats, parties associated with the independence movement dominate. Fretilin, the CNRT, and the PLP have regularly participated in governments in recent years.",4,"Politics continue to be dominated by independence-movement figures who have formed political parties. Veterans often serve as power brokers and organizers, while local village leaders are known to mobilize voters despite their ostensible nonpartisan status.",3,"Ethnic minorities are generally well represented in politics. While male independence leaders often hold key political roles and dominate elite political circles, 40 percent of parliamentarians are women. Four women ran for president in the 2022 elections. One-third of electoral-list candidates must be female. Women are massively underrepresented at the local level. Observers suggest that few women would seek office except for the existence of gender-parity legislation.",3
togo,"Opposition parties are generally free to form and operate; candidates can also run as independents. However, the dominance of the UNIR undermines the visibility and competitiveness of other parties. Opposition members are sometimes arrested in connection with peaceful political activities. Since 2017, authorities have suppressed opposition protests with deadly force and have arrested and tortured opposition supporters. The court system is used to sideline prominent opposition members.",2,"Gnassingbé’s family has held the presidency since the 1960s. Gnassingbé and the UNIR have retained power thanks in large part to the structure of the electoral system, malapportionment, and de facto control over electoral institutions.Political leaders have sought exile or otherwise lived abroad. Tikpi Atchadam, who led massive antigovernment demonstrations in 2017, remains in exile. UFC leader Gilchrist Olympio, meanwhile, resides in France, and the party has suffered from division in his absence.Genuine opposition parties have no legislative presence following their boycott of the 2018 elections, though they did gain mayoralties and municipal council seats in 2019.",1,"In 2005, the military installed Gnassingbé as president, in violation of the constitution. While security forces defend the regime through intimidation, the UNIR has been accused of relying on patronage and financial incentives, including the distribution of benefits for vote-buying purposes.",1,"The Éwé, Togo’s largest ethnic group, have historically been excluded from positions of influence; they are prominent within the opposition. Since 2010, the community has been politically split, as the Éwé-dominated UFC reached a power-sharing agreement with the government while the majority remained loyal to opposition forces. The government and security apparatus are dominated by members of Gnassingbé’s Kabyé ethnic group.Women face some societal pressure that discourages their active and independent political participation. Only 16 percent of the National Assembly members elected in 2018 were women. Candidate registration fees were halved for women ahead of the 2019 local elections. In 2020, Victoire Tomegah Dogbé became the first woman to serve as prime minister.",2
tonga,"There are no major restrictions on political competition. Lawmakers are also known to shift their allegiances; after former prime minister Pōhiva’s death in 2019, four lawmakers who were associated with the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands defected to the new Tonga People’s Party, effectively leaving the Democratic Party in opposition by year’s end.",4,"Rival coalitions led by Pōhiva’s popularly elected allies and more conservative politicians from the nobility have alternated in government in recent years, though Tu’i’onetoa governed with support from a mixture of popularly elected and noble members. Sovaleni’s election as prime minister in 2021 represented another change of government, as his only opponent, ʻAisake Eke, was backed by the outgoing prime minister.",4,"The monarchy, the nobility, and the country’s churches exert considerable political influence. In the months leading up to the 2021 elections, Tonga’s king repeatedly expressed his displeasure with the performance of the parliament. That September, the king criticized officials for lack of action in response to the illegal drug trade, and that October he addressed a national symposium on the drug crisis, potentially signaling an increase in the monarch’s political involvement. However, such public criticisms of the government have not continued under the Sovaleni administration.",3,"Women have the same formal political rights as men, but no women won seats in the 2021 parliamentary elections, down from two in the previous legislature. One woman was appointed in December to serve as minister of foreign affairs and tourism. Cultural biases tend to discourage women’s political participation, and women cannot inherit noble titles, meaning the seats reserved for nobility in the parliament are effectively reserved for men.Members of ethnic minority groups face similar obstacles, though the population is mostly homogeneous, and many members of the small Chinese minority have been able to obtain citizenship and its associated political rights.",3

While the PNM dominated the political landscape in the decades following independence, it has weakened in recent years; the national political arena is now largely divided between the PNM and the UNC, while the December 2021 elections in Tobago marked an end to the PNM’s long-running dominance there.Various factors, including the country’s first-past-the-post voting system, have made it difficult for less established parties to gain seats in Parliament.",3,"Rival parties consistently transfer power peacefully, with multiple changes in government through elections since the 1980s.",4,"People’s political choices are generally free from external pressure. However, observers have raised concerns about lack of transparency in campaign financing, which may enable improper influence and disadvantage opposition parties.",3,"All ethnic groups enjoy full political rights, and political parties are technically multiethnic, though the PNM is favored by Afro-Trinidadians and the UNC is affiliated with Indo-Trinidadians.Women’s political participation has increased in recent years, though they remain generally underrepresented. The speaker of the House of Representatives and 10 of the body’s 41 members are women. In 2018, Paula-Mae Weekes became the first woman to be elected president. In 2021, Tracy Davidson-Celestine of the PNM became the first female party leader in Tobago.Discrimination against LGBT+ people is widespread, affecting their ability to fully engage in political and electoral processes.",3
tunisia,"Tunisia’s numerous political parties represent a wide range of ideologies and interests, but since the president seized extraordinary powers in July 2021, parties have experienced serious restrictions on their ability to operate. After the suspension of the old parliament and parliamentary immunity, some lawmakers and political figures were immediately subjected to repressive measures, including travel bans, detention, and house arrest. Such judicial harassment continued during 2022. For example, Rached Ghannouchi, the former parliament speaker and leader of the Ennahda party, faced a travel ban, asset freezes, questioning by antiterrorism police, and legal charges ranging from money laundering to the promotion of “jihadist” activity. Former prime minister Ali Laarayedh, also of the Ennahda party, was placed in detention on terrorism charges shortly after the December 2022 elections.The new electoral law issued in September 2022, with its changes to funding and candidacy rules and the switch to single-member districts, was widely seen as a blow to the strength of political parties as opposed to individual candidates with access to private resources.",2,"Opposition parties and political independents have generally participated actively in political processes since 2011, resulting in multiple rotations of power at the executive and legislative levels. However, major opposition parties boycotted the December 2022 parliamentary elections to protest adverse conditions created by the authorities’ restrictions on opposition leaders beginning in 2021, the new constitution, and the new electoral law. The lack of meaningful competition in the elections contributed to their extremely low level of voter turnout.",3,"Voters are generally able to exercise their political choices without undue interference. However, powerful domestic economic interests have exercised a high degree of influence over politics. Foreign groups also reportedly supply funds to preferred parties and candidates, though these channels of support are opaque.In 2021, the president’s critics accused him of colluding with the regimes of the United Arab Emirates and Egypt to carry out his seizure of power, particularly in light of their common enmity toward Ennahda. However, the precise nature of foreign influence on recent political events remained unclear in 2022.",3,"Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations have worked to increase the political participation of marginalized groups. A 2017 law required an equal number of men and women at the top of candidate lists, as well as at least one candidate with a disability and three people under the age of 35 on each list. Representation of women in subsequent elections was comparatively high, and legislation aimed at protecting the rights of women has been passed. Fifty-four women held parliamentary seats after the 2019 elections, while 11 women and one openly gay man requested nomination to stand as candidates in the 2019 presidential election. The prime minister since 2021, Najla Bouden, is a woman.However, the September 2022 electoral law eliminated the 2017 quotas, and in the December 2022 parliamentary elections, only 11 percent of the candidates were women, 4 percent were aged 35 or younger, and two were people with disabilities.Other segments of the population, including the Amazigh ethnic community, Black Tunisians, and LGBT+ people, remain underrepresented in electoral politics. The first party dedicated to addressing Amazigh interests, the Akal Movement, was formed in 2019. Black Tunisians have achieved some progress in advancing their political interests, including passage of an antiracism law in 2018, but they are largely excluded from leadership positions and often conflated with foreign migrants. Societal discrimination and laws criminalizing same-sex sexual activity impede active political participation for LGBT+ people, and political parties largely fail to address LGBT+ issues.Both the 2014 constitution and the new charter adopted in 2022 state that the president must be a Muslim.",2
turkey,"Turkey maintains a multiparty system, with five major parties in the parliament. Parties are required to organize chapters and hold congresses in at least half of Turkey’s provinces no later than six months before an election in order to participate.Opposition leaders face politically motivated prosecutions and other harassment that affects their parties’ ability to function. Members of the HDP have faced regular such prosecutions since 2015, after a peace process with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) collapsed and the government accused the pro-Kurdish HDP of serving as a proxy for the PKK. (The PKK is now designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, as well as by the United States and European Union [EU]). The HDP’s offices are regularly raided by police and attacked by far-right mobs.Other opposition leaders also face politically motivated prosecutions and violent attacks. In December 2022, the mayor of Istanbul—Ekrem İmamoğlu of the CHP, widely considered a potential challenger to Erdoğan—was convicted of insulting state institutions and barred from politics, in a case widely considered to be politically motivated. Members of İmamoğlu’s staff remain under investigation over alleged links to the PKK and other groups designated as terrorist organizations. In May 2022, an appeals court upheld the prison sentence of the CHP’s Istanbul chair, Canan Kaftancioğlu, who was convicted in 2019 of insulting the president. Kaftancioğlu, who assisted with İmamoğlu’s 2019 mayoral campaign, was also banned from running for office. Former HDP cochair Selahattin Demirtaş remains in prison, after being detained in 2016 for “terrorist propaganda.” In 2020, the ECHR had ruled that his detention was politically motivated and ordered his release. Metin Gürcan, a founding member of the opposition Democracy and Progress Party (DEVA) and a political commentator, was jailed in November 2021 on espionage charges in connection with his research. He later said the research in question involved reports he had been preparing for diplomatic missions of Italy and Spain, and that the information within was compiled from open sources. He was released in May 2022 but rearrested two days later after his release was challenged in court; he faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.",2,"President Erdoğan and the AKP assert partisan control over the YSK, judiciary, police, and media. In recent years, they have aggressively used these institutional tools to weaken or co-opt political rivals, limiting the opposition’s ability to build voter support and gain power through elections. Despite these challenges, the opposition won control of most major urban centers in the 2019 municipal elections.Opposition leaders face obstacles even after winning elections. The government has replaced dozens of HDP mayors with trustees since the 2019 elections and has obstructed newly elected CHP mayors—including Istanbul mayor İmamoğlu—from carrying out their duties. Opposition leaders have been arrested and charged in politically motivated cases with offenses ranging from terrorism to insulting the president.",2,The AKP’s institutional dominance threatens to make the state itself an extension of the party that can be used to change political outcomes. The government’s influence over the media also tilts the electoral playing field heavily in favor of the ruling party.,3,"Political rights are experienced unevenly. Critics charge that the AKP favors Sunni Muslims, pointing to an overhaul of the education system that favored Islamic education in secular schools and promoted the rise of religious schools in the 2010s. The AKP also expanded the Directorate of Religious Affairs, using this institution as a channel for political patronage. Among other functions, the party uses the directorate to deliver government-friendly sermons in mosques in Turkey, as well as in countries where the Turkish diaspora is present.While members of Turkey’s non-Sunni Alevi community and non-Muslim citizens hold seats in the parliament, the government’s crackdown on opposition parties where they are concentrated has seriously harmed their political rights and electoral opportunities. While the Kurds, Turkey’s largest ethnic minority, are represented in politics, pro-Kurdish parties face regular harassment by the government via hate speech, politically motivated prosecutions, and disinformation in progovernment media.Women and LGBT+ individuals remain underrepresented in politics and in leadership positions in government. Women occupy 104 parliamentary seats, or 17 percent of the assembly. A handful of LGBT+ candidates have run for office, but LGBT+ people remain politically marginalized, in part because the government uses public morality laws to restrict advocacy for LGBT+ rights.While some refugees in Turkey, including nearly 4 million Syrians, have gained citizenship in recent years, there is no clear path for gaining citizenship status. Anti-immigrant sentiment among the public is high, and politicians who are openly discriminatory toward refugees have entered the political scene.",1
turkmenistan,"The party system is dominated by the ruling DPT and controlled by the executive branch. The 2012 law on political parties specified the legal basis for citizens to form independent parties, but barred parties formed on professional, regional, or religious lines, and those created by government officials. Nevertheless, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov subsequently announced plans to form two new groups—the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and the Agrarian Party. Both were then openly organized by sitting members of the DPT and formally registered in 2012 and 2014, respectively. The Agrarian Party won its first parliamentary seats in 2018.",0,"Turkmenistan has never experienced a peaceful transfer of power between rival parties through elections. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov had served in the government of his late predecessor, Saparmurat Niyazov, who in turn had ruled the country since before its independence from the Soviet Union. In March 2022, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov’s son, Serdar, took over as President. The Soviet-era Communist Party became the DPT in 1991 and remains in power to date. All genuine opposition groups operate either illegally or in exile.",0,"The authoritarian political system offers voters no meaningful alternatives to the ruling party. At an informal level, politics within the regime are thought to be influenced by regional patronage networks, or “clans,” that control different parts of the state and economy.",0,"Members of the ethnic Turkmen majority and the president’s tribal subdivision are favored for leadership positions. While women and members of ethnic or religious minority groups formally have full political rights, no segment of the country’s population enjoys the practical ability to engage in independent political activity.

tuvalu,"There are no formal political parties, though no law bars their formation. Candidates typically run as independents and form loose, frequently shifting alliances once in office.",4,"Tuvalu has an established pattern of democratic transfers of power. Individual prime ministers and governments rarely last a full term, with intense political rivalries sometimes prompting no-confidence votes. Such votes would be restricted under constitutional amendments proposed in December 2022.",4,"Traditional elders and the main Protestant church play an influential role in society, but they do not exercise undue control over individuals’ political choices.",4,"All Tuvaluans aged 18 and over who are present in the country on polling day but not imprisoned are eligible to vote. Politics are generally dominated by older, well-educated men. While women formally have full political rights, their participation is somewhat inhibited by discriminatory and widespread biases. Two women ran in the 2019 elections; one of them, an incumbent, won a seat. A move to add two reserved seats for women was considered as part of a constitutional review process in 2018 but has not since been acted upon.",3
uganda,"Uganda adopted a multi-party political system in 2005 after two decades of effectively one-party rule. The formation of political parties is legally protected, and many parties are registered. However, in practice, restrictive registration requirements and candidate eligibility rules, limited media coverage, and violent harassment by state authorities and paramilitary groups hinder opposition parties’ ability to compete. The NRM dominates the political sphere and consistently wins elections deemed neither free nor fair. The NUP has experienced significant repression from the authorities, particularly after the January 2021 elections. Several days after the polls, the party reported that military personnel raided its headquarters. In early February, Wine claimed that over 3,000 NUP members had been abducted by authorities, though the government claimed only 31 people had been arrested. As of September 2022, the NUP had refused to sign onto the 2022 memorandum of understanding for the Interparty Organization for Dialogue, a long-running entity that seeks to bring together parties in Parliament to discuss democratic reform, which the NRM leads.In June 2020, the government prohibited all political gatherings, nominally as a health measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban was disproportionately enforced on opposition parties.",1,"The NRM dominates all levels of government, such that it is often difficult to distinguish the party from state institutions. There are several dozen opposition lawmakers, as well as numerous independents (though many independents support the NRM). Election campaigns are characterized by violence, intimidation, and harassment of opposition candidates and supporters. Economic resources are also significantly tied to overtly or quietly supporting the NRM.Leaders of opposition parties and political movements are sometimes arrested on spurious criminal charges. For example, Wine was arrested several times during the 2020–21 campaign period and was placed under house arrest on polling day. He had previously been charged with treason over a 2018 incident. In July 2022, over 70 opposition party members were arrested during by-elections in Soroti and other parts of the country.",1,"The military, which remains closely aligned with Museveni and the NRM, has 10 reserve seats in Parliament. The government and NRM reportedly use public resources and patronage networks to build political support among religious leaders and other influential figures. The government has also been accused of bribing or coercing opposition parliamentarians and supporters to join its ranks; in July 2022, Democratic Party (DP) leader Norbert Mao, agreed to join the NRM and was subsequently appointed justice minister.Disappearances and political violence around the 2021 election loom large in the public’s awareness, particularly as some people have not returned from detention, which may discourage many from engaging in the political sphere.",1,"Although Uganda has many diverse ethnic groups, they lack equal representation. Groups like Alur, Ik, Bagungu, Bakonzo, Kakwa, Batwa, and Karamojong are disproportionately affected by violent conflicts, have less access to education, and receive inadequate health care. The NRM has repressed the political representation of and advocacy by these various ethnic groups, including those affiliated with subnational kingdoms.The political system includes quotas for special interest groups including youth, people with disabilities, elderly people, and women. Quotas for women span all levels of government, including Parliament where women held 33.8 percent of seats as of 2021. However, reserve seats have been criticized for creating the perception that directly elected positions are meant for men and have been called a means to co-opt women through patronage networks rather than meaningfully improving their representation and rights. LGBT+ people in Uganda face severe discrimination and are not represented in politics.",2
ukraine,"Prior to the 2022 invasion, with the exception of a ban on the Communist Party, there were no formal barriers to the creation and operation of political parties in Ukraine. However, in May 2022, Zelenskyy signed a law banning political parties that justify, recognize as legitimate, or deny Russian aggression against Ukraine. More than a dozen parties were subsequently identified as “pro-Russian” and banned, including the largest opposition party, the OPZZh. Five parties appealed the decision in courts, and some analysts and civil society groups expressed concern about a lack of safeguards to prevent these fast-track party bans from being imposed arbitrarily. Some members of the banned parties found ways to stay in office. A number of OPZZh members left the party and formed two new parliamentary groups, the Platform for Life and Peace (PZZhM) and the Restoration of Ukraine (VU). These lawmakers frequently voted in support of Zelenskyy’s initiatives during 2022 to demonstrate their readiness to cooperate with the ruling party. Ukraine’s opposition factions have also united into an informal “defense coalition” to minimize infighting and accelerate the passage of laws that are critical to national security. In March, the parliament stripped one national parliament member, Illia Kyva, of his mandate on suspicion of treason.In occupied parts of Ukraine, the Russian military has used intimidation, arbitrary detention, and torture to assert control over political expression and activities, and to force local civilians to submit to Russian rule. The Russian security services compiled lists of potential dissenters and conducted “filtration” at checkpoints throughout Russian-controlled areas. Some who escaped occupied areas reported being forced to denounce Ukraine and pledge allegiance to Russia on camera. It is estimated that more than 600 people who opposed the occupation were disappeared during the eight-month-long Russian military presence in western Kherson Region alone.A law that took effect in 2016 provides parliamentary parties with state funding, but it effectively favors established groups. Parties must win at least 5 percent of the vote to receive funding. New party registration fees are extremely high relative to average income and cost of living. Parties can only register with the Ministry of Justice if they can demonstrate a significant support base (10,000 signatures) in two-thirds of Ukraine’s oblasts (regions). Massive war-induced population displacement and human losses in 2022 presented additional challenges to future party formation. Party financing in Ukraine remains opaque, despite robust laws to regulate it. In November 2021, a law banning politically connected business magnates, known as oligarchs, from funding political parties went into effect. ",2,"Ukrainian politics feature dynamic competition among parties. Opposition groups continue to be represented in the parliament, and their political activities are generally not impeded by administrative restrictions or legal harassment. Grassroots parties often have difficulty competing with more established parties that have enjoyed the support and financial backing of oligarchs.",4,"Moscow wielded indirect political influence in some eastern and southern regions even after its seizure of Crimea and occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine beginning in 2014. However, the scale and scope of the 2022 invasion and atrocities committed by Russian troops against Ukrainian civilians have broken many of these ties, and the Russian government now largely relies on armed force to control political affairs in areas under its control. Ukrainian oligarchs exert significant influence over politics directly and indirectly, including through financial support for political parties and lobbying for the appointment of loyalists to key institutional positions. However, individuals defined as oligarchs under legislation signed into law in November 2021 were prohibited from funding political parties.Although electoral laws forbid the use of public resources in election campaigns, incumbent officials were able to use administrative resources without penalty during the 2020 local election campaign.",2,"There are no formal restrictions on the participation of women and members of ethnic, racial, or other minority groups in political life. However, their voting and representation are hindered by factors including discrimination that discourages political participation, and, for many Roma, a lack of identity documents. Independent candidates cannot run for local council positions in towns with over 10,000 inhabitants. Societal discrimination against LGBT+ people affects their ability to engage in political and electoral processes. Severe violence and repression that accompanied the 2022 Russian invasion precluded meaningful political participation for many individuals.A record 87 women were elected to the parliament in 2019, though this amounted to only 20 percent of all seats. Local elections held in October 2020 were the first to feature a mandatory 30 percent party-list gender quota, but some local lists did not comply with that requirement. Female representation in city councils stood at 30.2 percent after those elections, an improvement over the 18.1 percent figure in their previous terms. Female regional council representation increased from 15 percent to 27 percent.",3

The government has accused Al-Islah members of being foreign agents of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was designated as a terrorist organization in 2014.Dozens of activists, civil society leaders, academics, and students remained behind bars during 2022 for offenses related to political dissent.",0,The political system grants the emirates’ hereditary rulers a monopoly on power and excludes the possibility of a change in government through elections.,0,"The political choices available to eligible voters are severely limited in practice, and the alignments of both voters and candidates are heavily influenced by tribal networks.",1,"Approximately 90 percent of the UAE’s population consists of noncitizens who lack political rights and electoral opportunities, including thousands of stateless residents. There is no clear process for obtaining citizenship without Emirati parentage or marriage to an Emirati man; children of Emirati mothers and foreign fathers must apply for naturalization. In 2021, the prime minister announced that some foreigners, namely investors and certain skilled professionals, could seek naturalization under an amendment to the citizenship law. Women make up about 50 percent of the FNC electoral college, and approximately 180 women ran as candidates in the 2019 elections, more than double the 78 who ran in 2015. Women won seven of the elected seats on the council, and the authorities appointed 13 women in keeping with a pledge to ensure equal representation in the 40-member body. In practice, however, ordinary women have little opportunity to organize independently and advance their interests through the political system.",1
united-states,"The intensely competitive US political environment is dominated by two major parties: the Republicans on the right and the left-leaning Democrats. The country’s prevailing “first past the post” or majoritarian electoral system discourages the emergence of additional parties. The two parties’ primary elections allow for a relatively broad array of views and candidates to enter the political system, although those in many states exclude unaffiliated voters from this important stage of the electoral process. Both the 2020 and 2022 primaries and general elections featured participation by ideologically diverse candidates across the country.For the many seats at all levels that are regarded as “safely” Democratic or Republican, due to a combination of geographical sorting and partisan gerrymandering, primaries often represent the main battleground for opposing views. Republican incumbents, especially in the House, have faced sharp competition from more right-wing, sometimes Trump-backed challengers in recent voting cycles, and left-wing Democrats have challenged a number of moderate, party-backed candidates. In 2022, attention focused on the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump’s impeachment in January 2021. Four members of the group opted to retire, and four were defeated in primaries, including Representative Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the January 6 investigative committee and previously the third-ranked leader of Republicans in the House; the remaining two members managed to win their primaries and were reelected in November. Independent or third-party candidates have sometimes influenced presidential races or won statewide office, and small parties and ideological factions—such as the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, and the Democratic Socialists of America—have also modestly affected state and local politics in recent years. Several jurisdictions, including Maine, Alaska, and New York City, have adopted ranked-choice voting systems for some posts, which could prove more hospitable to third parties and centrist candidates than the majoritarian system, though in practice the results have generally matched those of the traditional plurality system.",4,"Power changes hands regularly at the federal level, and while certain states and localities are seen as strongholds of one party or the other, even they are subject to intraparty competition and interparty power transfers over time. In the 2022 elections, Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives following two terms of Democratic leadership, but their gains were smaller than expected. Democrats gained the governorships in Maryland and Arizona, leaving them with 24 compared with Republicans’ 26. Republicans maintained control over a solid majority of state legislatures and enjoyed both legislative and gubernatorial control in 21 states, compared with 17 states where Democrats led both branches of government.Trump’s efforts to overturn his loss to Biden in 2020 and early 2021 put serious pressure on the political and electoral systems, eroding the long-standing tradition of respect for official results and highlighting potential structural weaknesses that could be exploited by future candidates. While most Republican candidates who denied the legitimacy of Biden’s victory lost in statewide races in 2022, at least 150 such candidates won congressional races, and the persistence of unfounded doubts about the fairness of election administration continued to cause concern that future transfers of power could be disrupted.",4,"Various interest groups have come to play a potent role in the nominating process for president and members of Congress, partly because the expense and length of political campaigns place a premium on candidates’ ability to raise large amounts of funds from major donors. While there have been a number of attempts to restrict the role of money in political campaigning, most have been thwarted or watered down as a result of political opposition, lobbying by interest groups, and court decisions that equate political spending with free speech.The 2020 election campaigns included by far the most expensive presidential race ever, and 2022 marked the most expensive midterms to date. As with other recent campaigns, much of the spending was routed through various types of “super PACs” (political action committees that are not supposed to coordinate with any candidate), nonprofit organizations, and other legal entities that often protect donor anonymity and carry few restrictions on the size and source of donations. Small donations make up an important share of candidates’ fundraising, but extremely wealthy contributors play an outsized role in overall spending. Concerns about undue influence have also focused on lobbyists and others working for foreign governments who associate themselves with politicians or political campaigns. The Justice Department has increased enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to ensure transparency, but prosecutions alleging illegal consultant work for foreign powers have often resulted in acquittals.The January 2021 attack on Congress underscored a broader rise in violence and intimidation as a tool of political influence in the United States. Numerous known affiliates of right-wing extremist groups participated in the attack, and many Republicans and far-right media figures later sought to recast it as a patriotic protest or a defense of election integrity. Nearly 15 percent of the rioters who faced criminal charges had a law enforcement or military background; the participation of military veterans prompted the Defense Department to order a broad review of measures necessary to minimize extremist behavior among active-duty troops. Federal and state criminal investigations into the insurrection continued throughout 2022. As of late 2022, more than 950 people had been charged, with over 460 pleading guilty and 325 receiving sentences, including up to 10 years in prison. The most serious charges were filed against members of two far-right groups, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, for their alleged coordination of the January 6 violence. In November, Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes was convicted on multiple counts, though he and several codefendants were also acquitted of some charges.Meanwhile, reports of threats against elected officials and local election administrators have proliferated in recent years, with members of Congress subjected to a dramatic rise in intimidation. The risks were illustrated in October 2022, when a man was arrested for a brutal assault on the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at their San Francisco home; the speaker, who was not present at the time, was the intruder’s intended target. Armed individuals were also arrested near the homes of conservative Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh in June and Pramila Jayapal, a progressive congresswoman from Washington State, in July.",3,"A number of important laws are designed to ensure the political rights of members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and recent elections have featured an increase in candidates representing such groups. The Congress elected in 2020 included the first openly gay Black House members and record or near-record numbers of Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian American and Pacific Islander, LGBT+, and women lawmakers. Kamala Harris, whose mother and father were Indian and Jamaican immigrants, respectively, became the first Black American, the first Asian American, and the first woman to win election as vice president. The 2022 midterm elections included a record number of candidates from minority groups, as well as the first openly lesbian women to be elected as governors (in Massachusetts and Oregon), and the first women elected as governor or senator in several states. Nevertheless, White Americans and men have remained highly overrepresented in Congress, in state legislatures, and in senior policymaking positions.Racial and ethnic minority communities are disproportionately affected by laws and policies that create obstacles to voting and winning elected office. In 2013 the Supreme Court invalidated portions of the VRA of 1965, allowing certain states that previously had to submit legal changes for preclearance by federal authorities to adopt election laws without prior review. In the years since, in addition to adopting voter-identification requirements and limiting polling locations, a number of states—including some that were never subject to the preclearance rule—have partially rolled back innovations like early voting that contributed to higher rates of participation among minority groups. In 2021, the Supreme Court upheld restrictive Arizona voting rules against a VRA challenge, signaling a further weakening of the VRA as a safeguard against discriminatory state laws.Various other state election-management policies have been criticized for having a disparate impact on racial and ethnic minority communities, including voter-roll purges, arbitrary bureaucratic hurdles to registration, and efforts to punish voter fraud—a very rare phenomenon in US elections. Several Republican-led states created law enforcement units to investigate voter fraud following the 2020 election, yielding meager results. The most aggressive action occurred in Florida, where the arrests of at least 19 people—nearly all of them Black—in August 2022 were followed by questions about whether any of them had intentionally sought to evade eligibility rules.State laws that deny voting rights to citizens with felony convictions continue to disproportionately disenfranchise Black Americans, who are incarcerated at significantly higher rates than other populations. All but two states suspend voting rights during incarceration for felonies; a growing number of states have eased restrictions on voting rights after incarceration or during probation and parole, but the issue remains controversial. Overall, researchers estimated that more than five million people were disenfranchised for the 2020 elections due to felony convictions.",3

uruguay,"Uruguay’s multiparty system is open and competitive. The major political groupings are the Partido Colorado, the Frente Amplio coalition, and the Partido Nacional (also known as Blanco). Several smaller parties also compete in elections and have gained representation.",4,Opposition parties are competitive.

Indigenous groups are also severely underrepresented, although there is a currently a grassroots campaign that aims to gain formal government recognition of the Indigenous Charrúa people.Representation of women in national, regional, and local government is low. A 2014 law mandates that 30 percent of representatives be women; as of December 2022, women held approximately 26 percent of seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 29 percent of seats in the Senate. Two bills to increase women’s participation were introduced to the legislature by women from two different political parties in 2021. The bills remained under consideration as of year-end 2022.",4
uzbekistan,"Only five political parties are registered—O’zLiDep, the XDP, Adolat, Milliy Tiklanish, and the Ecological Party.

Women now hold approximately 33 percent of the seats in the lower house and 24 percent of the seats in the Senate. One woman, a member of the XDP, ran for president in 2021, taking 6.6 percent of the vote.",0
vanuatu,"Numerous political parties operate without restrictions in Vanuatu. Politicians frequently switch allegiances. The use of a single-nontransferable-vote system, particularly in larger multimember constituencies, is additionally believed to weaken political parties and encourage fragmentation.

Political groupings have historically been divided in part along linguistic lines, with an Anglophone majority and a Francophone minority.Women’s political participation is impaired by systemic biases. They are severely underrepresented in elected offices and run for office less frequently than men. Some seats are reserved for women at the municipal level, and women’s rights groups have lobbied for a national-level quota. One woman was elected to Parliament in October 2022, the first time a woman won a seat since 2004.",3
venezuela,"While opposition coalitions and parties exist, and some less confrontational groups have been tolerated by authorities, the ruling PSUV uses state resources as well security forces and the judiciary to disrupt parties that directly challenge its dominant position. In March 2022, the CNE nullified the leadership elections of the opposition party Avanzada Progresista (Progressive Advance), creating a rift within the group. The TSJ had similarly suspended and replaced the leaders of two other opposition parties, Acción Democrática (Democratic Action) and Voluntad Popular (Popular Will), in 2020.Opposition leaders have long been harassed, attacked, imprisoned, and otherwise impeded from participating in political processes. Juan Guaidó was physically assaulted by government supporters in June 2022 while he was meeting with residents in Cojedes State. Five members of the political party Bandera Roja (Red Flag) were arrested in July. In August, opposition leader and former lawmaker Juan Requesens was sentenced to eight years in prison for supposedly participating in an assassination plot against Maduro in 2018.According to the NGO Foro Penal (Criminal Forum), there were 246 political prisoners in Venezuela as of August 2022, and more than 9,000 others were not incarcerated but subject to arbitrary restrictions on their liberty. Multiple human rights groups have documented the use of torture and forced disappearances to control dissidents.Former allies of the government have also been targeted. In 2022, the Communist Party of Venezuela alleged that since 2018, five of its members had been murdered after denouncing government corruption.",0,"While discontent with the Maduro regime remains widespread, the government has cut off virtually all avenues for political change at a national level, and it has used a variety of tactics to create divisions within the opposition movement. Mediated negotiations between the government and opposition, on issues including the conditions for the 2024 presidential election, made little progress during 2022.",0,"The Maduro regime relies on the military, paramilitary forces, and opaque support from foreign states to retain political power. Military leaders have taken control of numerous offices, and Maduro has continued to strengthen the Bolivarian Militia, a millions-strong civilian militia group established in 2008 to support the military. Separately, irregular, state-affiliated armed groups known as colectivos routinely commit acts of violence against civilians and carry out government-backed voter intimidation efforts.",0,"The PSUV’s political dominance leaves little opportunity for ethnic and other groups to advocate independently for their interests. Indigenous people in Venezuela are poorly represented in politics, and members of these groups struggle to bring government attention to their concerns. In 2020 reforms to the National Assembly, the total number of legislators was significantly increased from 167 to 277, but the number of seats reserved for Indigenous representatives remained the same at three.Though several women hold senior positions in government, there is a lack of policy discussion regarding issues that primarily affect women. Almost no openly LGBT+ people hold senior political or government positions in Venezuela. The first openly transgender member of the National Assembly, Voluntad Popular member Tamara Adrián, held a seat in the assembly elected in 2015. In 2022, she declared that the LGBT+ community was unlikely to gain more rights under the current political leadership.",1

yemen,"Political parties continue to exist in Yemen, but they face severe repression by different authorities and armed groups across the country.The Houthis have harshly suppressed political dissent in areas under their control since 2015. Yemeni forces associated with the UAE have used arbitrary arrests, detentions, and enforced disappearances to persecute certain political groups, including members of Al-Islah, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Yemen.The power-sharing cabinet formed by anti-Houthi factions in 2020 included Hadi’s General People’s Congress (GPC) party; the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group backed by the UAE; Al-Islah; the Socialist Party; and a number of smaller parties and independents. The PLC established in April 2022 was headed by Rashad al-Alimi, who served as interior minister under former president Saleh and maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia.

zambia,"Political parties are registered under the Societies Act and do not regularly face onerous registration requirements. However, in January 2022, then DP president Harry Kalaba claimed that the government was attempting to manipulate an internal conflict over the party’s leadership. That same month, sources within the UPND shared a recording in which two government officials discussed targeting the DP ahead of a by-election, noted the reluctance of the ECZ’s chief executive to assist them, and intimated President Hichilema’s involvement in their efforts. Kalaba left the DP in July; in October, he became the leader of the Citizens First Party and accused the government of denying registration to his previous group, the Liberty Party.Leaders and officials in other parties faced charges and threats of violence in 2022. Raphael Nakacinda, a high-ranking PF official, was charged with defaming President Hichilema in April. In September, Patriots for Economic Progress leader Sean Tembo was charged with hate speech for comments directed at Hichilema. In October, an UPND youth leader threatened violence against opposition leaders. In November, National Democratic Congress leader Saboi Imboela was arrested on libel and hate speech charges.

zimbabwe,"Political parties generally form without interference. However, state media tend not to cover opposition parties, impacting their competitiveness. Authorities often suppress opposition gatherings. While opposition groups were able to hold most meetings with limited disruption in the run-up to the 2018 elections, the MDC and its supporters faced postelection raids, arrests, and prosecutions.CCC officials and supporters faced intimidation and violence in 2022, including ahead of the March elections. In June, CCC activist Moreblessing Ali was found dead in a section of the town of Chitungwiza; Ali had gone missing in May, with witnesses saying she was abducted by ZANU-PF supporters. CCC lawmakers Job Sikhala and Godfrey Sithole were charged with inciting violence after attending Ali’s funeral. Sithole was bailed in November but Sikhala remained in detention and was awaiting trial at year’s end.Chamisa of the CCC voiced concerns that he would be harmed during the year. In March, he claimed that government agents were plotting to assassinate him. In September, a device exploded near his convoy in Chinhoyi. The CCC blamed ZANU-PF supporters and state agents for that incident.Groups such as Mthwakazi Liberation Front (MLF) are blocked from conducting memorial meetings for victims of the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres.
